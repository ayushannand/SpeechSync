In March 2021, fierce winds blew a container ship off course.
In most places, this would have caused a minor incident.
But in the Suez Canal, it was a global crisis.
This vessel wasn’t just blocking other ships— It was obstructing the flow of international trade through one of the world’s most important waterways.
The site of the Suez Canal has been of interest to rulers of this region as far back as the second millennium BCE.
To move goods between Asia and the Mediterranean basin, traders had to traverse the narrow isthmus separating the Red Sea and the Nile, journeying in camel-bound caravans through the unforgiving desert.
A maritime passage between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea would bypass this trip altogether.
And throughout the 16th century, multiple powers attempted to construct such a canal.
But their plans were obstructed by cost, political strife, and the ever-shifting sands.
In 1798, interest in building a canal was rekindled, this time attracting attention from across Europe.
Over the following decades, individuals from Austria, Italy, Britain, and France pitched their plans to Egypt’s rulers.
At the time, Egypt was a territory of the Ottoman Empire, which was resistant to these proposals.
But Egypt's political and economic autonomy was gradually increasing, and its government was eager to pursue the project.
When Sa’id Pasha came into power in 1854, he approved a plan from the enterprising and manipulative French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps.
Signed in 1854 and 1856, a pair of concessions gave de Lesseps authority to establish the Suez Canal Company and finance it by selling shares to “capitalists of all nations.
” The contracts between Sa’id Pasha and the Canal Company also promised a workforce of hundreds of thousands of Egyptian workers.
Beginning in 1862, about 20,000 laborers were forcibly recruited every month, digging the canal in harsh desert conditions without easy access to food or water.
Diseases like cholera ran rampant and workers toiled under the threat of whips.
The estimates of those who died during construction range into the thousands.
In 1864, the new Egyptian ruler, Isma’il Pasha, put an end to the coerced Egyptian labor, but he still pressed forward with construction.
Foreign workers from all over Europe and the Middle East labored alongside dredgers and bucket excavators to remove 74 million cubic meters of dirt.
This massive population of workers required infrastructure to deliver drinking water and other supplies, giving rise to a flourishing economy of restaurants, brothels, and smuggled goods.
Amidst the bustle were born three new cities with multi-ethnic populations: Port Said on the northern Mediterranean shore, Ismailia on the canal's middle tract, and Port Tewfiq, at the southern edge of the canal.
The construction site bypassed the Nile and ran directly from Port Said to Suez.
And after years of work, the streams of the two seas finally began merging in the mid-1860s.
The finished canal was 164 kilometers long, with a width of 56 meters at the surface, and it was officially inaugurated on November 17th, 1869. While it struggled financially during its first few years, the canal ended up dramatically accelerating global trade.
It also facilitated the migration of numerous marine species, dramatically changing local ecosystems and cuisine.
Over the decades, traffic through the canal grew.
But in 1875, financial issues forced Egypt to sell much of its stock in the Canal Company, allowing Britain to take over.
It was only in 1956 that control of the canal fully reverted to Egypt when it was nationalized by President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
This move sparked a military standoff between Egypt and Britain, France, and Israel.
But once resolved, it transformed the canal into a major source of Egypt's national revenue and helped redeem the canal's imperialist legacy.
Today, nearly 30% of all global ship traffic passes through the Suez Canal, totaling over 20,000 ships in 2021. However, the incident of the Ever Given is a stark reminder of just how fragile our manmade systems can be.In March 2021, fierce winds blew a container ship off course.

The civilization of Kush was more than a thousand years old at that time.
Its early capital city at Kerma had impressive temples, palaces, and houses, including a massive mudbrick temple structure that had a chapel deep inside, reached by a long staircase at the center.
Rich gold mines helped the Kushites build a flourishing commercial network, making bronze weapons and tools and trading materials like incense, animal skins, ivory, and ebony wood from sub-Saharan Africa.
The tide started to change for Kush as Egypt descended into civil war.
By 750 BCE, Egypt was divided into local kingdoms with fluctuating alliances.
The Kushite king Piankhy saw an opportunity.
He led his navy, flanked by horsemen and archers, up the Nile to the gateway city of Khemenu.
As Piankhy’s army constructed siege ramps and battle towers, the city’s ruler sent his wives and daughters to negotiate— not with Piankhy, but with the women of his royal household, later known as kandake, who were extremely influential in military affairs and political succession.
At the end of a long siege, Piankhy entered the conquered city and bitterly criticized the conditions in its stables.
From there, Piankhy and the Kushite forces conquered the Egyptian capital of Memphis.
Piankhy installed his sister, Amunirdis, as priestess of the great god Amun, in the Egyptian city of Thebes, and left other Kushite officials there before returning to live in Kush.
His successors extended control all the way to the Nile Delta.
This was a high point for the Empire of Kush: trade thrived, and they built magnificent temples, palaces, and pyramid tombs all along the Nile.
But the Assyrian army was approaching Egypt in its annual campaigns.
When the Assyrians began to encroach on trade routes near Jerusalem, the Kushite king Taharqo moved to stop them.
The Assyrians defeated him with the help of some rebelling Egyptian princes, and drove him out of Egypt in the 7th century BCE.
The Kushites continued to rule in their homeland for nearly 1,000 years that were prosperous and innovative.
They moved their capital farther south to the city of Meroe, where they built temples to a new god called Apedemak.
They built new cities in the savannah south of the Sahara Desert, some of which contained huge reservoirs for water.
When the Roman Empire conquered Egypt in 31 BCE, Kushite armies again traveled north, led by Queen Amanirenas.
She led them to success in battle against the Romans, capturing the bronze head of a statue of the Roman emperor Augustus, and bringing it back to Kush.
They buried it under the doorway of a temple in the capital, so that worshippers would step on it as they crossed the threshold.
After brokering peace with the Romans, Kush continued to prosper.
Over time, however, groups of people called the Noba raided from the west, and trade routes were disrupted by the rising kingdom of Aksum.
Around 350 CE, the Aksumite king sacked Meroe, effectively bringing Kushite rule to an end.
Since then, some have argued that Kush’s history has been overlooked by generations of European and American scholars who promoted the idea that Egypt was part of the origin of Western civilization, while Kush, as an African culture, was excluded.
Today, there’s still much to learn about Kush— including a writing system we haven’t deciphered fully.Along the Nile River, in what is now northern Sudan, lay the ancient civilization of Kush.
Though they were once conquered by a powerful neighbor, the kings and queens of Kush would go on to successfully challenge two of the most dominant empires in history. From 1500 to 1100 BCE, Egypt controlled Kush, introducing many Egyptian cultural and religious practices.
The civilization of Kush was more than a thousand years old at that time.
They'll use that opportunity to chop it up with him, and often when they're done talking with him, they’ll mention that they think he’s a smart and engaging little guy.
One of the things that I’ve learned is that Americans have an orientation toward progress. In this context, what that means is that we often celebrate the distance between where we were and where we are now.
But that same orientation can blind us from the gap between where we are and where we could or should be.
The other thing I’ve learned about Americans is that we have a very, very narrow understanding of racism, mostly in the minds and hearts of people, usually old people -- old people from the South.
And this really narrow definition can constrain our opportunities to produce a more racially egalitarian society.
We like to hunt for races and distance ourselves from people who say mean things about whole groups of people or who idealize the 1950s. But the fact of the matter is that we might just need to look in the mirror.
Now, I'm not saying that everyone here is a racist, but what I am saying is that everyone here has the capacity and perhaps even the propensity to live their life in a way, to make decisions, to rely on biases that reproduce racial inequality.
Some people say, “Well, you do all this work about racism.
What’s the answer?
” And I say that the first thing we might need to do is to come to a shared understanding about what racism is in the first place.
History shows that racists have had the upper hand in deciding who the racists are and what racism is, and it’s never them or the things that they do.
But maybe if we come together and come to a shared and perhaps a precise definition of what racism is, we can work toward creating a society where mothers like me aren’t in constant fear of their children’s lives. 
I'd like to dispel three myths about racism on our trek toward mutual understanding. First: it’s true that the South has done its work to earn its reputation as the most racist region.
But there are other states and regions that are competing for the title.
For example, if we look at the most segregated states in terms of where Black kids go to school, we'll see, sure, some are in the South.
There are some out west, in the Midwest and in the Northeast.
They're where we live.
Or if we look at states with the biggest racial disparities in terms of prison populations, we see that none of them are in the South.
They're where we live.
My colleague Rebecca Kreitzer and I looked at a standard battery of racial attitudes of prejudice, and we found that in the 1990s, states in the South dominated the most racially negative attitudes.
But this geography has evolved, and things have changed.
By 2016, we found that the Dakotas, Nebraska, states in the Midwest, in the Northeast, were competing for the "most prejudiced population" titles.
Now, I'm not saying that one state is more racist than another, but what I am saying is that every state might have its own special brand of racism.
And it doesn't have to be like this.
Most of the inequalities that we see in our day-to-day lives happen at the state and local level.
What that means is that we don't have to go all the way to Congress to make change in our communities.
We can simply hold our city, our county, our state legislators to task to produce more equitable outcomes.
Myth two: we're not that good at hunting for racists. Remember that time when the governor of Virginia did blackface, and people were like, "Oh, that's bad.
I need to get that racist out of here"?
I was giving y'all the side-eye, and here's why.
While people were going back to yearbooks to look for things that were obviously racist, fewer people were looking into the current-day policy stances of legislators who probably did blackface but didn't get caught.
So, how many of us might have supported a candidate who is willing to let neighborhoods secede from their district so that kids could go to all-white schools -- in the 21st century?
Or how many of us might have supported a ballot measure that systematically reduced some groups' chances of voting?
Or how many of us might have focused on the behavior of Black mothers rather than doctors or health care systems and policies when we learn about the huge racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality?
It doesn't have to be like this.
We could do something different.
We could scrutinize the behaviors of the rule makers.
We could orient ourselves toward a more just society, and on our way there, we can't mystify practical policy solutions.
But we also know that they don't live diverse lives.
Research shows that the average white American literally has one black friend.
And what that means is that most don't have any at all.
Sociologists like Sarah Mayorga show that even when well-meaning white folks move to diverse neighborhoods, they don't necessarily have positive interactions, no less any with their neighbors who aren't white.
My research with Professor Christopher DeSante shows that when we ask white millennials their racial attitudes and policy preferences, that they're sometimes, just as in other times, even more racially conservative than boomers.
When we ask them about the things that are important to them, they don't have any particular sense of urgency around questions of racial inequality.
How did we get like this?
Well, one of the things we might think about is how we raise our kids and equip them to solve the problems that we want them to solve.
Research shows that white parents in particular will either choose to not talk about issues of racism to their kids in order to protect them from a harsh racial reality or they instill colorblind lessons, and that can actually reinforce negative racial attitudes.
So it's kind of like how some of your parents might have given you books about puberty so they didn't have to talk about the birds and the bees, and then you tried to connect all the dots and then you did it all wrong.
It's like that.
It doesn't have to be like this.
We can do better.
We can have hard conversations with our kids so that they don't grow up like many of us did, thinking that talking about racism makes you a racist -- it doesn't -- and so that we can prevent them from making the same mistakes that we've seen in the past.
Remember a long, long time ago in 2008, when we were all pining to live in a post-racial world?
Well, I say that it's time for us to think bigger and dream bigger and think about what it would be like to live in a post-racist world.
So we could ask harder questions of candidates about their stances on racial inequality before we throw our full weight behind them.
We could buycott or boycott businesses whose practices don't align with our values.
We could talk to our kids about racism.
We could figure out our state's special brand of racism and work to eradicate it. People made racial disparities, and people can unmake them.
And sure, it'll be hard, but the fact of the matter is, someone is depending on us to do nothing at all.
Thank you.
(Applause)When I’m out at the grocery store or maybe a restaurant or the park with my son -- he’s six and a half -- people will stop us and mention that they think that he’s handsome. I agree.
They'll use that opportunity to chop it up with him, and often when they're done talking with him, they’ll mention that they think he’s a smart and engaging little guy.
When those people walk away, the thought that comes to my mind is that I hope they remember meeting him as a child when they see him again as a grown man.
This thought comes to my mind because I’ve written two books about race and racism in the United States, and this kind of work can produce feelings of pessimism.
One of the things that I’ve learned is that Americans have an orientation toward progress. 
In this context, what that means is that we often celebrate the distance between where we were and where we are now.
But that same orientation can blind us from the gap between where we are and where we could or should be.

Myth three: If you believe that when all the grandmas in Mississippi die that racism is going to go with them, you are in for a big disappointment. 
We like to think that young people are going to do the hard work of eradicating racism, but there are some things that we should note. 
We know that young folks, young white folks especially, like diversity, they appreciate it, they're looking for it.
Sociologists like Sarah Mayorga show that even when well-meaning white folks move to diverse neighborhoods, they don't necessarily have positive interactions, no less any with their neighbors who aren't white.
It doesn't have to be like this.
If the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland melt completely, millions of people's homes will be under water.
The coldest nights in the Arctic might get 10 degrees warmer.
The warmest days in Mumbai might get five degrees hotter.
Over the past 10,000 years, we've been lucky.
Earth's climate was stable and our civilizations flourished.
But as our climate gets more unstable, so will our economies and our societies.
We'll all suffer, and the vulnerable will be hit hardest, unless we act now.
[Countdown Take action on climate change at Countdown. ted. com]Why is 1.5 degrees such a big deal?
Because to warm our entire planet up by 1.5 degrees Celsius requires a lot of heat.
All this extra heat melts glaciers, which raise sea levels.
If the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland melt completely, millions of people's homes will be under water.
The extra heat also intensifies weather, making wet places wetter, dry places drier and increasing the ferocity of storms.
That 1.5-degree increase also won't be distributed evenly.
The coldest nights in the Arctic might get 10 degrees warmer.

My dad passes away.
My mind racing, memories, flashbacks, moments, early mornings, getting up, taking grounders and throwing, speed outs and deep post routes to my brother and my dad, to early morning car rides to AAU baseball, to my dad being the third-base coach.
And however many millions and millions of people all over the world watching.
And having to walk to the media, and what do I say next, what do I do, what do I think?
Being married at a young age and just coming out of college and everything else, to, you know, shortly after, marriage not working out and realizing, you know what?
Life happens.
Life happens, life happens to all of us.
Loss of family members, divorce, fear, pain, depression, concerns, worries.
It's hard to be positive in the midst of it all.
And what I definitely knew was this: that negativity works 100 percent of the time.
Negativity was going to get me nowhere.
I started saying to myself, "New are his mercies every morning," new beginnings, new starts.
And despite hardship and pain and worries and wanting to get through it and "How do I do this?
", I started thinking about a car.
You know how when you drive a car, you've got stick shift and you want to shift to neutral?
You go from first gear to second gear, all the way to fifth?
You've got to know how to shift to neutral.
And I needed to shift to neutral immediately, before I crashed.
Sitting there after the Super Bowl, I had a decision to make: Will I let this define my career? Will I let it define my life?
Hell, no.
What I found out was this: that mindset is a skill.
It can be taught and learned.
I started 10 years ago, training my mind, with this guy named Trevor Moawad, my mental conditioning coach.
He's been with me for 10 years, and we've been best friends and partners ever since.
As athletes, we train the body, we train ourselves to be able to run fast, throw farther, jump higher and do these different things, but why don't we train our mind?
What do you want your life to look like?
Write it out, talk about it, say it.
What's our language, what does it look like, watch these highlights, Russell, when you're in your best moments.
What does that look like?
And be that, live that, sound like that.
The best free throw shooters, they don't worry about the shot they just missed.
They think about this shot, this putt, this throw, this first down.
Then I met this kid Milton Wright, 19 years old, he had cancer three different times.
This day when I went to see him, he was frustrated, "Russ, I'm done, I don't want to do this anymore, it's my time to go.
" I started telling him this story about my dad, how he used to say, "Son, why not you?
Why don't you graduate early, play pro football and pro baseball?
Why not you, why not you?
" I said, "Milton, why not you?
If you tried T-cell therapy, and you try this and it doesn't work, you won't remember it.
" So Milton got a smile on his face and said, "You're exactly right.
Yes, I do have cancer, Russ.
But I can either let this kill me, not just physically, but I can also let it kill me emotionally and mentally.
And I have a choice right now, in the midst of the problem, in the midst of the storm, to decide to overcome.
" One of the questions I always get asked about neutral thinking is this: "Does that mean I don't have any emotion?
" And I always say, absolutely not.
Yeah, we have emotions, we have real-life situations, we have things to deal with.
But what you have to be able to do is to stay focused on the moment and to not be superemotional. It's OK to have emotions, but don't be emotional.
When people look at me, they see that I'm the highest-paid player in the NFL, they see that I have the girl and Ciara, that I have the family and this and that.
But I still have real-life situations.
We all do.
We all have, you know, sadness and loss and depression and worries and fear.
I didn't just get here.
What's the truth, and how do I come through this better?
And that's really, kind of, how my mind started shifting.
It was not just on the success of it all or the failure of it, it was on the process, like: What is the next step, how do I do this right here, right now?
We have a choice to make in life.
And for me, when I was young and I didn't have much, I made a choice.
I made a choice that I was going to believe that great things were going to happen, that I was going to have my mindset right, and I was going to have the right language and the right things to think about, which helped prepare me for today.
Because I'm just human.
I just have the ability to throw the ball a long way and run around and make some cool and fun throws and make some people smile.
But the reality is that I still have pressure, I still have worries, I still have fears, I still have things that happen.
Still have loss.
Positivity can be dangerous.
But what always works is negativity.
I never wanted to live in negativity, so I stayed in neutral.
I kept my shift in neutral.
And so that's where I lived, and that's where I've been living ever since.June 8, 2010, Russell Wilson, fourth-round pick to the Colorado Rockies baseball.
I'm fired up, one of the highest moments of my life.

Positivity can be dangerous.
I like to get past the fur, the feathers and the scales.
I want to get under the skin. No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog, my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.
You may wonder, do I ever photograph people? Sure. People are always present in my photos, no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions.
You just have to learn how to look past their disguise. As a photographer, I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thing.
When I use my camera, I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are. As animals blessed with the power of rational thought, we can marvel at the intricacies of life.
As citizens of a planet in trouble, it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.
But as humans with hearts, we can all rejoice in the unity of life, and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave.
Let's find a way to join the dance.
Thank you. (Applause)
My dad's not alone.There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia, and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million.
That's a lot of people.Dementia scares us.The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia, the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us. And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things: 
We go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me. 
" Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia, and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us. I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
That's what happened with my dad. My dad was a bilingual college professor.
His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds.
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.
We should retain those people.
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people.
" But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?
What do they look like?
You might think these must be very senior teachers.
And the answer is no.
Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter.
The variation is very, very small.
You might think these are people with master's degrees.
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality.
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all, is a master's degree.
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.
One is seniority.
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
Teach for America: slight effect.
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
There are some people who are very good at this.
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it, to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?
" The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
And it's a system with very high turnover.
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
It's an unbelievable thing.
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching.
They take the poorest kids, and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools.
They're constantly improving their teachers.
" They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
How does that compare to a normal school?
And they need advanced notice to do that.
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.
Of course, digital video is cheap now.
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?
" And they could all sit and work together on those problems.
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it, have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
If you have a kid who's behind, you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet, but you could make it so that DVDs were always available, and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system, we can do it much better.
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP -- the place that this is going on -- that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice.
" And I thought it was so fantastic.
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
(Applause) Now, we put a lot of money into education, and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting -- the House version actually had money in it for these data systems, and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things.
But I -- I'm optimistic.
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is, and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.
I only had time to frame those two problems.
There's a lot more problems like that -- AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited, just at the very name of these things.
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.
So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things, get other people involved -- and you're helping to come up with solutions.
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.
Thank you.
(Applause)I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation, sharing some of the problems.
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that -- being honest about what was going well, what wasn't, and making it kind of an annual thing.
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally.
That is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things.
And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to.
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand.
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite, is to look at childhood deaths.
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of five.
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.
It's a phenomenal thing.
Each one of those lives matters a lot.
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs: vaccines that were used more widely.
For example, measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000. So we really can make changes.
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again. And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.
Why?
Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths: diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning, which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?
Well, what's the history of this disease?
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.
In fact, if we look at the genetic code, it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.
So it was absolutely gigantic.
And the disease was all over the world.
A terrible disease.
It was in the United States.
It was in Europe.
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s, when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.
So it was everywhere.
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.
And so that's why the death rate did come down.
Now, ironically, what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where the rich countries are.
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
1945, it's still most places.
1970, the U. S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries, it doesn't get much investment.
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria.
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
(Laughter) And rich men are afflicted.
And so that's why that priority has been set.
But, malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact.
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much.
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
(Laughter) There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
(Laughter) (Applause) Those mosquitos are not infected.
So we've come up with a few new things.
We've got bed nets.And bed nets are a great tool.
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night, so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.
And that's happened now in a number of countries.
But we have to be careful because malaria -- the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.
And so you end up with two choices.
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way, you do it vigorously, you can actually get a local eradication.
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.
Now we're on the upswing.
There's new drug discovery going on.
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.
And so as these elements come together, I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria.
Now let me turn to a second question, a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?
And the answer is no.
Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter.
The variation is very, very small.
You might think these are people with master's degrees.
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality.
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all, is a master's degree.
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.
One is seniority.
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
Teach for America: slight effect.
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
There are some people who are very good at this.
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it, to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?
" The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
And it's a system with very high turnover.
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
It's an unbelievable thing.
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching.
They take the poorest kids, and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools.
They're team teaching.
They're constantly improving their teachers.
They're taking data, the test scores, and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase.
" They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms, at first it's very bizarre.
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?
" The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.
What's going on?
" And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention, which kids were bored, and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.
Everybody needs to be involved.
And so KIPP is doing it.
How does that compare to a normal school?
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.
The data isn't gathered.
In the teacher's contract, it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom -- sometimes to once per year.
And they need advanced notice to do that.
" Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.
They don't have the test scores, and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.
But I'm optimistic about this, I think there are some clear things we can do.
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well, and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?
" And they could all sit and work together on those problems.
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it, have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system, we can do it much better.
" And I thought it was so fantastic.
(Applause)
Walking in front of him was her. The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart.
Sure, she had aged a little. In fact, she had aged a lot. But he felt all his old passion for her return.
"Ford," he called softly. For that was her name.
"Don't say another word, Gusty," she said, for that was his name. "I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here. Let's go there and make love.
In the tent.
" Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.
The earth moved for both of them. And they lived together happily ever after.
And all because he decided to walk that day.
(Applause) Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate. The moral imperative is on the table. Great creativity is needed to take it all, make it simple and sharp.
To make it connect.
To make it make people want to act.
So this is a call, a plea, to the incredibly talented TED community.
Let's get creative against climate change. And let's do it soon.
Thank you.

I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit, and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.
And so, I have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning, and then following it up and trying to understand it.
And so one of the questions that I asked you is, when you look around, what do you see?
Well, you see this space that's created by designers and by the work of people, but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here, being reshaped in a certain form.
And so the question is: how did that material get here?
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?
It's a question of what's the continuity?
So one of the things I look at is, how did the universe begin and shape?
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?
So that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
If you look at this picture, what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars, and you can see them there -- little pluses. This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here.
But there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby, and they're kind of the color of the Sun, and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.
But one of the questions is -- this should be, to you -- how come there are so many galaxies?
Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky. This is only 1,000 galaxies.
We think there's on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope, if you had the time to scan it around -- about 100 billion galaxies.
Right?
It's a very large number of galaxies.
And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.
But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.
So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know, what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that?
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.
We're going to try and follow it up.
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study, and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres, just because that's where we're making observations.
And the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.
Two seconds is like the present.
The Sun is eight minutes ago.
That's not such a big deal, right, unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.
You'd like to have a little advance warning.
But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away.
It's a problem.
You hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars because it takes light long enough to go there.
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars, to the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.
So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy, it's thousands of years ago.
If you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy, and it's two million years ago.
If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago, there'd be no evidence of humans at all, because we don't think there were humans yet.
I mean, it just gives you the scale.
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years.
And so that's the sort of sequence, and so I have a more artistic impression of this.
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way, and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies, and there's a sphere that marks the different times.
And behind that are some more modern galaxies.
You see the whole big picture?
The beginning of time is funny -- it's on the outside, right?
And then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.
It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun; you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.
But you can see the edge of the Sun, and the universe gets that way, and you can see that.
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside, and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang, which is actually incredibly uniform.
The universe is almost a perfect sphere, but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exaggeration.
And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth.
So it's a big design job, but we'll see about how things are going on.
So the way these measurements were done, there's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.
So there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989, and we discovered these variations.
And then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched -- the WMAP -- and it made somewhat better pictures.
And later this year -- this is the cool stealth version, the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it, and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched, and it will make very high-resolution maps.
And that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe.
And what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us the secrets, both about the structure of space-time, and about the contents of the universe, and about how the universe started in its original motions.
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture, and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.
And it's maturing up to the present time.
And there's some spectacular things.
And this wastebasket part, that's to represent what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.
And so this is a pretty weird model, right?
What kind of evidence do we have for that?
So let me show you some of nature's patterns that are the result of this.
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space, and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.
They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture, identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies, estimate how far away they are, and plot them up. And just put radially they're going out that way.
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall, but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.
Now I'm going to show you this in 3D.
What happens is, you take pictures as the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.
There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy, or because there are no telescopes available to do it.
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?
Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies, you know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall, and you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.
There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.
So there's an interesting pattern, but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.
We only have a million galaxies, right?
So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air but, what's going on?
There's another survey which is very similar to this, called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.
Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million.
And every time there's a galaxy -- at its location there's a galaxy -- and if we know anything about the galaxy, which we do, because there's a redshift measurement and everything, you put in the type of galaxy and the color, so this is the real representation.
And when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.
It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience, it's hard to see the pattern of this.
So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.
And you'll see, first, the structure of the survey, and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there.
So again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here.
But you can see the voids, you can see the complicated structure, and you say, well, how did this happen?
Suppose you're the cosmic designer. How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?
It's not just throwing them out at random.
There's a more complicated process going on here.
How are you going to end up doing that?
And so now we're in for some serious play.
That is, we have to seriously play God, not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.
So if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?
What's the kind of technique?
What's the kind of thing you're going to do?
And that is, you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules, but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.
And then you put in some randomness, some fluctuations and some randomness, and realize a whole bunch of different representations.
So what I'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales.
We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.
It's called dark matter.
That is matter that doesn't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does, the way the light's shining on me or on the stage.
It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it, we're going to make it white. OK?
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.
It should be called invisible matter, but the dark matter we've made visible.
And the stuff that is in the yellow color, that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies.
So I'll show you the next movie.
So this -- we're going to zoom in.
Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.
We're going to zoom in and zoom in.
And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.
And when a number of filaments come together in a knot, that makes a supercluster of galaxies.
This one we're zooming in on is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.
So we live in the boonies.
We don't live in the center of the solar system, we don't live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster.
So we're zooming in.
This is a region which probably has more than 100,000, on the order of a million galaxies in that region.
We're going to keep zooming in. OK. And so I forgot to tell you the scale.
A parsec is 3.26 light years.
So a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that's the scale.
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.
Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here.
That's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?
These little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies.
Now we're going to zoom back out, and you can see this structure that, when we get very far out, looks very regular, but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.
So they're simple building blocks.
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter, it's got photons and it's got neutrinos, which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.
And it's just a simple fluid and it, over time, develops into this complicated structure.
And so you know when you first saw this picture, it didn't mean quite so much to you.
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes, but you realize they're not even the main structure.
There's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter, that's out there that's actually holding it all together.
So let's fly through it, and you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this out.
So here's that same end result.
You see a filament, you see the light is the invisible matter, and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.
And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around, and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect, and you get a large cluster of galaxies.
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is, and you can see what it looks like.
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?
It's only when you look at it at a very large scale, and explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate, complicated kind of a design, right?
And it's grown up in some kind of way.
So the question is, how hard would it be to assemble this, right?
How big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together, right?
That's the issue, right?
And so here we are.
You see how the filament -- you see how several filaments are coming together, therefore making this supercluster of galaxies.
And you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look if you -- first, you can't travel this fast, everything would be distorted, but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.
This is how, if you took billions of years to go around, it might look to you, right?
And if you could see invisible matter, too.
And so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe in a very simple way?
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe, everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments, was once in a region that was smaller than an atom.
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations, but expanding at a tremendous rate.
And those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes, and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background.
And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on.
So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one.
So I'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture.
So you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point, now four times smaller, and so forth.
And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.
And this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it.
And you see how the dark matter lumps up, and the ordinary matter just trails along behind.
So there it is.
At the beginning it's very uniform.
The fluctuations are a part in 100,000. There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000, and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in.
This is light over density, pulls the material around in.
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material.
But the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now, in terms of its expansion.
So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see, and then only things that have started forming already are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.
So we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.
We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.
So we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.
And that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was.
So this is what we started with 15 years ago, with the Cosmic Background Explorer -- made the map on the upper right, which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations, and actually fluctuations on several scales.
You can kind of see that.
You can see that just from the map alone.
We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non-linear effects that are starting to move, to modify, and are giving us a hint about how space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments.
So that's where we are today, and that's what I wanted to give you a flavor of.
And so, I have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning, and then following it up and trying to understand it.
And so one of the questions that I asked you is, when you look around, what do you see?
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?
So one of the things I look at is, how did the universe begin and shape?
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?
If you look at this picture, what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars, and you can see them there -- little pluses. This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here.
Right?
It's a very large number of galaxies.
But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.
Two seconds is like the present.
That's not such a big deal, right, unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.
But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away.
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy, it's thousands of years ago.
If you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy, and it's two million years ago.
If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago, there'd be no evidence of humans at all, because we don't think there were humans yet.
And it's maturing up to the present time.
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.
We only have a million galaxies, right?
There's another survey which is very similar to this, called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.
There's a more complicated process going on here.
How are you going to end up doing that?
That is, we have to seriously play God, not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.
What's the kind of thing you're going to do?
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.
A parsec is 3.26 light years.
Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here.
These little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies.
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter, it's got photons and it's got neutrinos, which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.
And it's just a simple fluid and it, over time, develops into this complicated structure.
So here's that same end result.
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is, and you can see what it looks like.
So the question is, how hard would it be to assemble this, right?
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations, but expanding at a tremendous rate.
So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.
So we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.
I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view, and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion.
That is all well and good, but where do we go wrong, and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?
In one of the battles that the prophet waged, he told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war to the greater war, to the greater battle." And they said, "Messenger of God, we are battle-weary. How can we go to a greater battle?
" He said, "That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego.
" "It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I," as we might say in English.
The voice says, "Go away.
" After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle, he comes back. With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door. The voice asks, "Who is there?
" He said, "It is you, O heartbreaker.
" The door swings open, and the voice says, "Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's," -- two capital I's, not these eyes -- "for two egos.
" And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.
In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one "I," and that is the "I" of divinity.
But don't ignore what you've asked them to do. "And," God says, "my servant continues to get nearer to me, by doing more of what I've asked them to do" -- extra credit, we might call it -- "until I love him or love her.
" It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.
Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism, the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us.
I'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you, have had what you might call a spiritual experience, a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps, the boundaries of your ego dissolved.
The source of our being and the end of our journey, you are also the breaker of our hearts.
You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live, and for whose purpose we shall die, and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings.
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
We know it all.
We have access to it all.
One is asking for angur -- one is, say, an Englishman -- one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.
And they have a fight and an argument because -- "I want grapes. " "I want eneb. "I want angur. " -- not knowing that the word that they're using refers to the same reality in different languages.
There's only one absolute reality by definition, one absolute being by definition, because absolute is, by definition, single, and absolute and singular.
There's this absolute concentration of being, the absolute concentration of consciousness, awareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity.
And these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human.
For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically, is our physiology, but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature.
And the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says, "When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay, and breathed into him of my spirit, then, fall in prostration to him.
" The angels prostrate, not before the human body, but before the human soul.
Why?
Because the soul, the human soul, embodies a piece of the divine breath, a piece of the divine soul.
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.
What is the imagery of God?
The imagery of God is absolute being, absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love.
And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge and that, with the presence and help of people like you here, we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.
For he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore.
(Applause)I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view, and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion.
That is all well and good, but where do we go wrong, and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?

Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism, the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us.
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way, get our egotism out of the way.
I'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you, have had what you might call a spiritual experience, a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps, the boundaries of your ego dissolved.
This is all you. And this is all us.
And us, and I, and us are all part of you. O, Creator! O, the Objective!
The source of our being and the end of our journey, you are also the breaker of our hearts.
You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live, and for whose purpose we shall die, and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings.
" Our message today, and our purpose today, and those of you who are here today, and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
We know it all.
We have access to it all.
Jung may have called it "the subconscious.
" Through our subconscious, in your dreams -- the Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death," "the temporary death" -- in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions, we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us, and we see wonderful things.
We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it, and beyond the limitations of time as we know it.
But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.
God, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om, whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity, it is the locus of absolute being, absolute love and mercy and compassion, and absolute knowledge and wisdom, what Hindus call "satchidananda.
" The language differs, but the objective is the same.
Rumi has another story about three men, a Turk, an Arab and -- and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.
One is asking for angur -- one is, say, an Englishman -- one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.
And they have a fight and an argument because -- "I want grapes. " "I want eneb. "I want angur. " -- not knowing that the word that they're using refers to the same reality in different languages.

Compassion is not defined in one form.There's no Indian compassion.
There's no American compassion. It transcends nation, the gender, the age. Why?
Because it is there in everybody.
It's experienced by people occasionally. Then this occasional compassion, we are not talking about -- it will never remain occasional. By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate. You can't say, "Please love me.
" Love is something you discover. It's not an action, but in the English language, it is also an action. I will come to it later.
Maybe the swami is right.Maybe the swami is right.
" You start your new life.
Then everything becomes meaningful.
You learn cycling by cycling. You learn cooking by cooking, having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook. (Laughter) And, therefore, what I say, you have to fake it and make it. (Laughter) You need to.

What's unleavened bread?
God wants bread. I know what God wants. " And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread, took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue, opened the ark and said, "God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are.
" He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it. " He goes in there, and it's not there. And he says, "God, you really did want it.
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed. And then my question became, am I the only one who does this?
Why were other people blocking it?
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes," but I won't say, "Would you praise me this way?
" And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me. I'm telling you where I'm insecure. I'm telling you where I need your help. And I'm treating you, my inner circle, like you're the enemy.
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear.What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife -- go ask her, what does she need?
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you. And it's simple. And why should we care about this?
We talk about world peace. How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?

The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years.
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
So, here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.
At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market. We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms.
The scale became very important, and it's become our pet project.
It's successful, it's been running for 12 years.
And we supply the Conran shops, and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.
This is our group, our main group of weavers.
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
They all have bank accounts.
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
It's a weekly turnaround of production.
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.
And the rest says it all.
Thank you very much.

I mean, this was -- was I my things?
I always live in the present -- I love the present.
I cherish the future.
That's my camera lens.
Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.
"You've got to make something good out of something bad," I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.
I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig. " That's me at my desk.
That was a desk took 40-some years to build.
That's my daughter, Jean.
" I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces, which I'm just starting to work on -- my next project.
That's my sister.
Pieces of it.
Idea about women.
The negatives are gone. That's my father's letter to me, telling me to marry the woman I first married when I was 20. That's my daughter and me.
She's still there. She's there this morning, actually.
That's my house.
I came to live it, and I am living it.
Thank you everybody.
I always live in the present -- I love the present.
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid, like, you've got to make something good out of something bad. You've got to make something good out of something bad.
This was bad! Man, I was -- I cough. I was sick.
That's my papers.
Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.
I didn't know.
She's still there. She's there this morning, actually.
My children, Davey and Henry.
I guess you're just my fatal attraction-ie.You’re my Clonie.♫ Thank you. (Applause)But anyway, this is about the evils of science, so I think it’s perfect.
Maybe you have this child at home.
He sounds something like this.
Now, if he practices for a year and takes lessons, he's now eight and he sounds like this.
(Laughter) I didn't say, "I'm going to move my shoulder over, move my body.
He said, "I was so moved.
Your FM is always on that classical dial.
That's the second group.
" (Laughter) Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.
You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome.
And the telephone. The telephone. If your mother calls on the miserable telephone, she calls and says, "Hello," you not only know who it is, you know what mood she's in.
You have a fantastic ear.
Everybody has a fantastic ear.
So nobody is tone-deaf.
But I tell you what.
It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing, with such a wide gulf between those who understand, love and are passionate about classical music, and those who have no relationship to it at all.
The tone-deaf people, they're no longer here.
But even between those three categories, it's too wide a gulf.
So I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room, downstairs and in Aspen, and everybody else looking, will come to love and understand classical music.
So that's what we're going to do.
Now, you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work, if you look at my face, right?
It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming.
Imagine if Martin Luther King had said, "I have a dream.
Of course, I'm not sure they'll be up to it.
" (Laughter) All right.
So I'm going to take a piece of Chopin.
This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.
Some of you will know it.
(Music) Do you know what I think probably happened here?
When I started, you thought, "How beautiful that sounds.
" (Music) "I don't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year.
" (Laughter) It's funny, isn't it?
It's funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head.
And of course -- (Applause) Of course, if the piece is long and you've had a long day, you might actually drift off.
Then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say, "Wake up!
It's culture!
" And then you feel even worse.
(Laughter) But has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you, but because of us?
Did anybody think while I was playing, "Why is he using so many impulses?
" If I'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it.
(Music) (Music ends) And for the rest of your life, every time you hear classical music, you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses.
So let's see what's really going on here.
We have a B.This is a B.
The next note is a C. And the job of the C is to make the B sad.
And it does, doesn't it?
(Laughter) Composers know that.
If they want sad music, they just play those two notes.
(Music) But basically, it's just a B, with four sads.
(Laughter) Now, it goes down to A.
Now to G. And then to F.
So we have B, A, G, F.
And if we have B, A, G, F, what do we expect next?
(Music) That might have been a fluke.
Let's try it again.
(Music) Oh, the TED choir.
(Laughter) And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?
Nobody is.
You know, every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China -- everybody knows: da, da, da, da -- da.
Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.
Chopin didn't want to reach the E there, because what will have happened?
It will be over, like Hamlet.
Do you remember?
Act One, scene three, he finds out his uncle killed his father.
He keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him.
And then he backs away, he goes up to him again, almost kills him.
The critics sitting in the back row there, they have to have an opinion, so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator.
" Or they say, "Hamlet has an Oedipus complex.
" No, otherwise the play would be over, stupid.
(Laughter) That's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet -- Ophelia going mad, the play within the play, and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.
That's in order to delay -- until Act Five, he can kill him.
It's the same with the Chopin.
He's just about to reach the E, and he says, "Oops, better go back up and do it again.
" So he does it again.
Now, he gets excited. (Music) That's excitement, don't worry about it.
Now, he gets to F-sharp, and finally he goes down to E, but it's the wrong chord -- because the chord he's looking for is this one, and instead he does . . . Now, we call that a deceptive cadence, because it deceives us.
I tell my students, "If you have a deceptive cadence, raise your eyebrows, and everybody will know.
He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.
Now, he tries E again.
That chord doesn't work.
Now, he tries the E again.
Now, he tries E again, and that doesn't work.
And then finally . . . There was a gentleman in the front row who went, "Mmm.
" (Laughter) It's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day, turns off the key in his car and says, "Aah, I'm home.
" Because we all know where home is.
I'm going to play it all the way through and you're going to follow. B, C, B, C, B, C, B -- down to A, down to G, down to F.
He goes back up to B, he gets very excited.
Goes to E.
And finally goes to E, and it's home.
You know, we were just in South Africa, and you can't go to South Africa without thinking of Mandela in jail for 27 years.
Lunch?
No, he was thinking about the vision for South Africa and for human beings.
Like the bird who flies over the field and doesn't care about the fences underneath, all right?
A beloved grandmother, a lover -- somebody in your life who you love with all your heart, but that person is no longer with you.
Bring that person into your mind, and at the same time, follow the line all the way from B to E, and you'll hear everything that Chopin had to say.
Well, I did this at a school in Boston with about 70 seventh graders, 12-year-olds.
Finally, I said, "Why am I clapping?
" And one of them said, "Because we were listening.
And I did this with them -- a risky thing to do, because they were street kids.
And it felt really good to cry for my brother.
If only we could move it to four percent, our problems would be over.
(Laughter) How would you walk?
How would you talk?
How would you be? If you thought, "Three percent of the population likes classical music, if only we could move it to four percent.
" How would you walk or talk?
How would you be? If you thought, "Everybody loves classical music -- they just haven't found out about it yet.
" See, these are totally different worlds.
Now, I had an amazing experience.
I was 45 years old, I'd been conducting for 20 years, and I suddenly had a realization.
The conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound.
My picture appears on the front of the CD -- (Laughter) But the conductor doesn't make a sound.
He depends, for his power, on his ability to make other people powerful.
And that changed everything for me.
It was totally life-changing.
People in my orchestra said, "Ben, what happened?
" That's what happened.
I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people.
And of course, I wanted to know whether I was doing that.
How do you find out?
You look at their eyes.
If their eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.
You could light up a village with this guy's eyes.
(Laughter) Right.
So if the eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.
If the eyes are not shining, you get to ask a question.
And this is the question: who am I being that my players' eyes are not shining?
We can do that with our children, too.
Who am I being, that my children's eyes are not shining?
That's a totally different world.
Now, we're all about to end this magical, on-the-mountain week, we're going back into the world.
And I say, it's appropriate for us to ask the question, who are we being as we go back out into the world?
And you know, I have a definition of success.
For me, it's very simple.
So now, I have one last thought, which is that it really makes a difference what we say -- the words that come out of our mouth.
I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz, one of the rare survivors.
She went to Auschwitz when she was 15 years old. And . . . And her brother was eight, and the parents were lost.
And she told me this, she said, "We were in the train going to Auschwitz, and I looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing.
I said, 'Why are you so stupid, can't you keep your things together for goodness' sake?
'" The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother.
And so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow.
She told me this.
She said, "I walked out of Auschwitz into life and I made a vow.
And the vow was, "I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say.
" Now, can we do that? No. And we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong.
But it is a possibility to live into. Thank you. (Applause) Shining eyes. (Applause) Shining eyes.
(Applause) Thank you, thank you.Probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the 1900s.
They were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes, and they wrote telegrams back to Manchester.
And one of them wrote, "Situation hopeless. Stop. They don't wear shoes.
" And the other one wrote, "Glorious opportunity.
They don't have any shoes yet.
" (Laughter) Now, there's a similar situation in the classical music world, because there are some people who think that classical music is dying.
And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet.
And rather than go into statistics and trends, and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing, and the record companies that are folding, I thought we should do an experiment tonight.
Actually, it's not really an experiment, because I know the outcome.
(Laughter) But it's like an experiment.
Now, before we start -- (Laughter) Before we start, I need to do two things.
One is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child sounds like when he plays the piano.
(Music) (Music ends) I see some of you recognize this child.
Now, if he practices for a year and takes lessons, he's now eight and he sounds like this.
(Music) (Music ends) He practices for another year and takes lessons -- he's nine.
What actually happened was the impulses were reduced.
You see, the first time, he was playing with an impulse on every note.
(Music) And the second, with an impulse every other note.
(Music) You can see it by looking at my head.
(Laughter) The nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes.
(Music) The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.
(Music) And the 11-year-old, one impulse on the whole phrase.
(Music) I don't know how we got into this position.
(Laughter) I didn't say, "I'm going to move my shoulder over, move my body.
" No, the music pushed me over, which is why I call it one-buttock playing.
(Music) It can be the other buttock.
(Music) You know, a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing, when I was working with a young pianist.
He was the president of a corporation in Ohio.
I was working with this young pianist, and said, "The trouble with you is you're a two-buttock player.
You should be a one-buttock player.
" I moved his body while he was playing.
And suddenly, the music took off.
It took flight.
The audience gasped when they heard the difference.
Then I got a letter from this gentleman.
He said, "I was so moved.
I went back and I transformed my entire company into a one-buttock company.
You adore classical music.
Your FM is always on that classical dial.
That's the first group, quite small.
Then there's another bigger group.
The people who don't mind classical music.
(Laughter) You know, you've come home from a long day, and you take a glass of wine, and you put your feet up.
A little Vivaldi in the background doesn't do any harm.
That's the second group.
Now comes the third group: people who never listen to classical music.
It's just simply not part of your life.
You might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport . . . (Laughter) -- and maybe a little bit of a march from "Aida" when you come into the hall.
But otherwise, you never hear it.
That's probably the largest group.
And then there's a very small group.
These are the people who think they're tone-deaf.
Amazing number of people think they're tone-deaf.
Actually, I hear a lot, "My husband is tone-deaf.
" (Laughter) Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.
Nobody is tone-deaf.
If you were tone-deaf, you couldn't change the gears on your car, in a stick shift car.
You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome.
And the telephone. The telephone. If your mother calls on the miserable telephone, she calls and says, "Hello," you not only know who it is, you know what mood she's in.
You have a fantastic ear.
Everybody has a fantastic ear.
So nobody is tone-deaf.
The tone-deaf people, they're no longer here.
When I started, you thought, "How beautiful that sounds.
It's culture!
(Laughter) But has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you, but because of us?
(Music) (Music ends) And for the rest of your life, every time you hear classical music, you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses.
So let's see what's really going on here.
We have a B.This is a B.
The next note is a C. And the job of the C is to make the B sad.
And it does, doesn't it?
(Laughter) Composers know that.
If they want sad music, they just play those two notes.
(Music) But basically, it's just a B, with four sads.
(Laughter) Now, it goes down to A.
Now to G. And then to F.
So we have B, A, G, F.
And if we have B, A, G, F, what do we expect next?
(Music) That might have been a fluke.
Let's try it again.
(Music) Oh, the TED choir.
(Laughter) And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?
Nobody is.
You know, every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China -- everybody knows: da, da, da, da -- da.
Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.
Chopin didn't want to reach the E there, because what will have happened?
It will be over, like Hamlet.
Do you remember?
Act One, scene three, he finds out his uncle killed his father.
He keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him.
And then he backs away, he goes up to him again, almost kills him.
The critics sitting in the back row there, they have to have an opinion, so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator.
" Or they say, "Hamlet has an Oedipus complex.
" No, otherwise the play would be over, stupid.
(Laughter) That's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet -- Ophelia going mad, the play within the play, and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.
That's in order to delay -- until Act Five, he can kill him.
It's the same with the Chopin.
He's just about to reach the E, and he says, "Oops, better go back up and do it again.
" So he does it again.
Now, he gets excited. (Music) That's excitement, don't worry about it.
Now, he gets to F-sharp, and finally he goes down to E, but it's the wrong chord -- because the chord he's looking for is this one, and instead he does . . . Now, we call that a deceptive cadence, because it deceives us.
I tell my students, "If you have a deceptive cadence, raise your eyebrows, and everybody will know.
" (Laughter) (Applause) Right.
He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.
Now, he tries E again.
That chord doesn't work.
Now, he tries the E again.
That chord doesn't work.
Now, he tries E again, and that doesn't work.
And then finally . . . There was a gentleman in the front row who went, "Mmm.
" (Laughter) It's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day, turns off the key in his car and says, "Aah, I'm home.
" Because we all know where home is.
So this is a piece which goes from away to home.
I'm going to play it all the way through and you're going to follow. B, C, B, C, B, C, B -- down to A, down to G, down to F.
Almost goes to E, but otherwise the play would be over.
He goes back up to B, he gets very excited.
Goes to F-sharp.
Goes to E.
And finally goes to E, and it's home.
What was he thinking about?
Would you think of somebody who you adore, who's no longer there?
(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Now, you may be wondering -- (Applause) (Applause ends) You may be wondering why I'm clapping.
Well, I did this at a school in Boston with about 70 seventh graders, 12-year-olds.
At the end, they went crazy, clapping.
I was clapping.
They were clapping.
" And one of them said, "Because we were listening.
Am I sure that every single person followed that, understood it, was moved by it?
But I'll tell you what happened to me in Ireland during the Troubles, 10 years ago, and I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids on conflict resolution.
And one of them came to me the next morning and he said, "You know, I've never listened to classical music in my life, but when you played that shopping piece . . . " (Laughter) He said, "My brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for him.
But last night, when you played that piece, he was the one I was thinking about.
And it felt really good to cry for my brother.
They say three percent of the population likes classical music.
If only we could move it to four percent, our problems would be over.
" See, these are totally different worlds.
People in my orchestra said, "Ben, what happened?
And of course, I wanted to know whether I was doing that.
How do you find out?
You look at their eyes.
If their eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.
You could light up a village with this guy's eyes.
(Laughter) Right.
So if the eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.
If the eyes are not shining, you get to ask a question.
That's a totally different world.
Now, we're all about to end this magical, on-the-mountain week, we're going back into the world.
And I say, it's appropriate for us to ask the question, who are we being as we go back out into the world?
And you know, I have a definition of success.
For me, it's very simple.
It's not about wealth and fame and power.
It's about how many shining eyes I have around me.
So now, I have one last thought, which is that it really makes a difference what we say -- the words that come out of our mouth.
I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz, one of the rare survivors.
She went to Auschwitz when she was 15 years old. And . . . And her brother was eight, and the parents were lost.
And she told me this, she said, "We were in the train going to Auschwitz, and I looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing.
I said, 'Why are you so stupid, can't you keep your things together for goodness' sake?
'" The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother.
Unfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him, because she never saw him again.
He did not survive.
And so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow.
She told me this.
She said, "I walked out of Auschwitz into life and I made a vow.
And the vow was, "I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say.
" Now, can we do that? No. And we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong.
But it is a possibility to live into. Thank you. (Applause) Shining eyes. (Applause) Shining eyes.
(Applause) Thank you, thank you.
The ammonia was toxic, it sprayed everywhere. But it was kind of an interesting thought. So the great thing about 2006, there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. So we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved -- a lot of computational fluid dynamics.

One way to change our genes is to make new ones, as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.
Another is to change our lifestyles.
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be, that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.
When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more, your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.
But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now.
This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us.
Now, there's some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells.
Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries, alcohol in moderation, stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana.
I'm just the messenger.
(Laughter) What were we just talking about?
(Laughter) And other things that can make it worse, that can cause you to lose brain cells.
The usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar, nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress.
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle, so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.
Your heart gets more blood flow.
We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left, after only a year become measurably less clogged.
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left, the blue means no blood flow.
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow.
We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer, simply by making these changes.
We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited 70 percent in the group that made these changes, whereas only nine percent in the comparison group.
These differences were highly significant.
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow, so you increase sexual potency.
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services, showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries, can cause a heart attack or a stroke, but it also causes impotence.
Half of guys who smoke are impotent.
How sexy is that?
Now we're also about to publish a study -- the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.
This is what's called a heat map -- and the different colors -- and along the side, on the right, are different genes.
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed -- in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes, turning off the disease-promoting genes.
And so these findings I think are really very powerful, giving many people new hope and new choices.
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe, that are giving you your genetic profiles, are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?
" Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes -- they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise, we can actually change how our genes are expressed.
Thank you.

(Applause)
Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.
They think it's crank.I don't think it's crank.
And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow, and I would love to see where that leads.
Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20, 25,000 years ago?
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor, when there was presumably a competition among many languages?
How far back does that go?
How far back does modern language go? How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?
Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is?
But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years, or something of that kind.
It's what we call a bottleneck. CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.
You may just know more about everything than anyone.
So, it's been an honor.
Thank you Murray Gell-Mann.
(Applause)Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.

(Applause)
How does the news shape the way we see the world?
Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.
And here's how news shapes what Americans see.
This map -- (Applause) -- this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories, by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago. Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.
There was massive flooding in Indonesia. And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.
The U. S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.
And when we take out the U. S. and look at the remaining 21 percent, we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else. The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story, here's how the world looked. What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq, and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report. And the cycle continues; as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.
So, why don't we hear more about the world?
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai, there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America -- places that are home to more than two billion people.
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news.
Local TV news looms large, and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.
And what about the web?
The most popular news sites don't do much better.
Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News' front page.
And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.
Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U. S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters, and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.
So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates, as well as less educated Americans, know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.
And if you think it's simply because we are not interested, you would be wrong.
In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent. The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world?
I know we can do better. And can we afford not to? Thank you.
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief, but about behavior. Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.
How dare we be optimistic?
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture. As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, "You must become the change you wish to see in the world.
" And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior" is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.
I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids, and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house, and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.
But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs, it is more important to change the laws.
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives, we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this, we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.
In order to solve the climate crisis, we have to solve the democracy crisis.
And we have one.
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.
I was reminded of that recently, by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at, just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s, looked like she had a kind face.
I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction, also just staring at me.
And so I said, "How do you do?
" And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black, you would look just like Al Gore.
" (Laughter) Many years ago, when I was a young congressman, I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.
And the military historians taught me, during that quest, that military conflicts are typically put into three categories: local battles, regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important global, world war -- strategic conflicts.
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources, a different approach, a different organizational model.
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories, and most of what we think about are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution, hazardous waste dumps.
But there are also regional environmental problems, like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe to the Arctic, and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.
And there are lots of those.
But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global, or strategic, conflict. Everything is affected.
And we have to organize our response appropriately.
We need a worldwide, global mobilization for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.
We have work to do.
And we can mobilize resources and political will. But the political will has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.
Let me show you these slides here.
I thought I would start with the logo.
What's missing here, of course, is the North Polar ice cap.
Greenland remains.
Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.
This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory. This is what's happened in the last 28 years. To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.
Here's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers.
The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much.
It comes back in the winter, but not as permanent ice, as thin ice -- vulnerable.
The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years.
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
Already, around the Arctic Circle -- this is a famous village in Alaska.
This is a town in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California.
"They were the best of times, they were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence in English literature. I want to share briefly a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus are exactly the same size.
Earth's diameter is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.
They have exactly the same amount of carbon.
But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere, deposited in the ground as coal, oil, natural gas, etc.
On Venus, most of it is in the atmosphere.
The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average.
On Venus, it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible, and putting it into the atmosphere.
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
It's three times hotter than Mercury, which is right next to the Sun.
Now, briefly, here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images, but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.
The global scientific community says: man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere, thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.
You all know that.
At the last IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say, "How certain are you?
" They wanted to answer that "99 percent.
" The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was "more than 90 percent. " Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute, this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun.
" If that were true, the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.
If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here.
Here is the lower atmosphere.
Here's the stratosphere: cooler.
CSI: Climate.
Now, here's the good news.
Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming.
Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way.
There has been progress, but here is the key: when given a list of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.
What is missing is a sense of urgency.
If you agree with the factual analysis, but you don't feel the sense of urgency, where does that leave you?
Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono -- did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.
This is the winner.
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates: two of them were about the climate crisis.
ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.
Fox: two. CNN: two.
CBS: zero.
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older tobacco commercials.
So here's what we're doing.
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries.And us. But it's not just the developed nations.
The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace.
And actually, their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 1965. And they're catching up very dramatically.
The total concentrations: by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985. If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture, we would still have this crisis.
This is in Bolivia -- over thirty years.
This is peak fishing in a few seconds.
The '60s. '70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this.
And the good news is that we can.
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this: the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions, all has a single, very simple solution.
People say, "What's the solution?
Put a price on carbon.
We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral, to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck -- and some things have changed since the 19th century.
In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis.
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries.
This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe.
These are concentrating solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid" to supply all of the electrical power to Europe, largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents. This is not pie in the sky; this can be done.
We need to do it for our own economy.
The latest figures show that the old model is not working.
There are a lot of great investments that you can make.
And it is based on an old model.
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse.
Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent.
Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense.
I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.
But geothermal, concentrating solar, advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation.
The only two countries that didn't ratify -- and now there's only one.
And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.
Lot of other things contributed to it, but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto, and he has.
This is Lake Lanier.
Here's more good news.
Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine.
We now have a culture of distraction. But we have a planetary emergency. And we have to find a way to create, in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.
I wish I could find the words to convey this.
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.
Thank you very much.
(Laughter) CA: When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's -- are you excited by their plans on global warming?
All three have offered leadership, and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration.
Every single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal.
So that's why I began by saying, be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen. Demand -- change the light bulbs, but change the laws.
We have to speak up.
Go on the Internet.
Connect with people.
This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign -- grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads, radio, newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.
AG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question. What can I do?
" It does depend on all of us, but again, not just with the light bulbs.
So we have to have a change in consciousness.
A change in commitment.
A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge.
So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track -- many of you probably know it.
And the song began to move on I understand like this.
And when Noah had done built his Ark . . . Move on . . . In fact . . . Concern . . . So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.
And then he went and knocked an old lady house.
" And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in.
Good morning. Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.
Thousands of books have been written about him, but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.
So, what do you think?
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.
He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.
The young man should be made first.
And as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case.
But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?
The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces.
The icon of icons finally has a face.
So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information.
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere, is a very different place. Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.
And I thought, "That's very peculiar.
" And I looked down at my body and I thought, "Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing.
" And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience.
And it was all very peculiar, and my headache was just getting worse.
So I get off the machine, and I'm walking across my living room floor, and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down.
And every step is very rigid and very deliberate.
There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems.
And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body.
I heard a little voice saying, "OK. You muscles, you've got to contract.
I can't define where I begin and where I end, because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall.
And all I could detect was this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself, "What is wrong with me?
What is going on?
" And in that moment, my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent.
Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button.
Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind.
But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me.
And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive.
I felt at one with all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there.
Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me, "Hey!
We've got a problem!
We've got to get some help.
" And I'm going, "Ahh!
I've got a problem!
" (Laughter) So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem. " But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there.
Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world.
So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress related to my job -- it was gone.
And I felt lighter in my body.
And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those -- they were gone.
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.
And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage!
(Laughter) Oh!
I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful.
And again, my left hemisphere comes online and it says, "Hey!
You've got to pay attention.
We've got to get help.
" And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus.
" So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking, "I've got to get to work.
Can I drive?
" And in that moment, my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!
" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow!
How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out?
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards.
But then I would drift back out into La La Land, and not remember when I came back if I'd already dialed those numbers.
Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain.
Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape.
And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized, "But I'm still alive!
And if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana. " And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time.
And it motivated me to recover.
So who are we?
We are the life-force power of the universe, with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds.
And we have the power to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world.
Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are.
I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is.
Or, I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become a single individual, a solid.
Separate from the flow, separate from you.
I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist.
These are the "we" inside of me.
Which would you choose?
Which do you choose?
And when?
I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.
It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines, in which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role.
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs," and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.
So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forms.
Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families?
And if so, how did they make arrangements?
Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved.
Of course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations, the first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.
And it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks; marks on clay in that time.
Not too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented.
And this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years, for the elite administrators (Laughter) who kept track of accounts for the empires.
And then another communication technology enabled new media: the printing press came along, and within decades, millions of people became literate.
And from literate populations, new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge, religion and politics.
We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation, constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.
Not created by the printing press, but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.
And again, new forms of wealth emerged.
Now, commerce is ancient.
Markets are as old as the crossroads.
But capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old, enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies, such as the joint-stock ownership company, shared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.
Now of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet, and in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press, a broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.
Evolution is speeding up.
More recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops, and very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority of the human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today.
Now, when I started looking into collective action, the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas.
If you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later.
(Laughter) The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war: two players who couldn't trust each other.
Let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.
If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question: if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all?
He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered, much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won -- it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won, it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.
Here's how the game is played: there are two players; they've never played the game before, they will not play the game again, they don't know each other, and they are, in fact, in separate rooms.
First player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10, whatever that player wants to propose.
The second player either accepts the split -- both players are paid and the game is over -- or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over.
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness, that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions, whether we know that or not.
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons. Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.
He used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.
He had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it.
Now, Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, in 1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask, which is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?
So she went out and looked at what data she could find.
She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds, forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case, humans destroyed the commons that they depended on.
But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma; in fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.
They escape by creating institutions for collective action.
And she discovered, I think most interestingly, that among those institutions that worked, there were a number of common design principles, and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work.
I'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines.
In biology, the notions of symbiosis, group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.
But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.
And again, our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned.
Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.
In fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.
And most recently, neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain.
Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together.
Now, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms.
Commerce is ancient.
Markets are very old.
Capitalism is fairly recent; socialism emerged as a reaction to that.
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source, pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.
I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth, we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones.
Very briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun -- some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.
Eli Lilly -- in, again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world -- has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems.
Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace, treats them as a network and trains them to produce better, even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.
Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism; they're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.
Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.
Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.
Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.
They're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.
eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.
Instead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves," it's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate.
" Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.
BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader, making the system more efficient the more it is used.
Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them to link together through the Internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that's Folding@home at Stanford -- to crack codes, to search for life in outer space.
I don't think we know enough yet.
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are, but I think we can begin to think about them.
And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them, but think about self-interest.
This is all about self-interest that adds up to more.
In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.
In the U. S. , in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world, citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.
Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?
I believe that the payoff would be very big.
I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines.
Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.
When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease, suffering was alleviated.
What forms of suffering could be alleviated, what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation?
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen; it's going to require effort.
So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So I thought, "I will talk about death.
" Seemed to be the passion today.
Actually, it's not about death.
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die. That's what I want to talk about.
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi!
I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died.
" And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer.
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook.
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore. Handwriting is a disappearing art.
I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new?
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug. But too late.
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him.
So what do I plan to leave for my son?
I collect autographed books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy.
I plan to publish my own notebook.
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son.
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation. And those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years. I took it out for the first time to come here.
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again.
" Thank you.
(Applause) (Music) (Applause)
I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses.
I am very happy and honored to be amidst very, very innovative and intelligent people.
I have listened to the three previous speakers, and guess what happened?
Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here, and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.
(Laughter) But there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something, that bud is a young one.
So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old, I still will say something.
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment, because another conference is taking place in Berlin.
It is the G8 Summit.
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid, something akin to the Marshall Plan.
Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.
One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.
Its largest recipients were Germany and France, and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.
An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP, and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries.
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.
How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.
By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness, the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.
However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.
Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine, although they're part and parcel of our African reality, they are not the only reality.
And secondly, they are the smallest reality.
Africa has 53 nations.
We have civil wars only in six countries, which means that the media are covering only six countries.
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience.
But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.
It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.
And, as a consequence, the Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.
The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair.
What should we do with it?
We should give food to the hungry.
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.
We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war.
And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.
I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.
But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa, from a challenge of despair, which is called poverty reduction, to a challenge of hope.
We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty.
It should be a challenge of creating wealth.Once we change those two things -- if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction, you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent, with what?
Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry, and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.
And in the process, none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes of Africa's fundamental problems.
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines, ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.
Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.
Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa, our second challenge will be, who are the wealth-creating agents in any society?
They are entrepreneurs.
[Unclear] told us they are always about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.
So, where should we be putting the money?
We need to put money where it can productively grow.
Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.
Support research institutions, because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health, for primary education, for food relief.
The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair, in need of charity.
Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know, who became rich by receiving charity?
By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?
Does any one of you in the audience have that person?
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another?
Well, since I'm not seeing the hand, it appears that what I'm stating is true.
(Bono: Yes!
) Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.
Which country is that?
(Bono: It's an Irish land.
) (Laughter) (Bono: [unclear]) AM: Thank you very much.
But let me tell you this.
External actors can only present to you an opportunity.
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity.
Africa has received many opportunities. Many of them we haven't benefited much.
Why?
Because we lack the internal, institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations.
I'll give you an example.
Under the Cotonou Agreement, formerly known as the Lome Convention, African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.
My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons of sugar to the European Union market.
We haven't exported one kilogram yet.
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.
Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement, African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.
None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana, has ever met its quota.
So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.
And all forms of intervention need support, the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth, the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.
How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?
Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?
Because all governments across the world need money to survive.
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial, they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.
Why should people support their government?
Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs, or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption.
The fact is no government in the world, with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin, can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.
Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.
To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education, primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.
If the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people, such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion.
It will sit with those who create wealth.
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.
The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa.
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy, it lies with international donors.
Why?
Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business -- it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.
In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy- implementation process in our countries.
We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.
The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens, and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid, is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.
But I want to put a caveat on my argument, and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.
It may have built a road, and that road may have served a very good role.
Aid increases the resources available to governments, and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state, especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa, aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie.
Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.
Governments are not changing it.
Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens.
They talk to international donors.
So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government, and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid.
Where has all the aid gone?
I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda, and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.
The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?
Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue?
It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.
But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments, but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure.
Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.
The military, 380 billion.
Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens, takes only 18 billion.
Trade and industry takes 43 billion.
And let me show you, what does public expenditure -- rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?
There you go.
70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers, by the way, who never see the president, except on television.
(Laughter) (Applause) And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this, and even there, it is him who advises them.
(Laughter) We have 81 units of local government. Each local government is organized like the central government -- a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament, and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.
There were 56, and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits, he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81. Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.
One hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies, all of which have directors and the cars.
And the final thing, this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.
A recent government of Uganda study found that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters.
Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary, none of which has an ambulance.
So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects, while the poor die without ambulances and medicine.
Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here, I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt. It should be short enough to arouse interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
I hope I have achieved that.
(Laughter) Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said, it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.
My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.
But literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms, by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving, thank you very much, least of all not by me.
I was too young, unmarried, I had no children, didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.
And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life, and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.
I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well, so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda, and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986, to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.
And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere, meaning "to go forward with enthusiasm.
" And while we were doing it, I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.
And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery that was run by 20 prostitutes.
And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group, and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.
And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language, and how what we call people so often distances us from them, and makes them little.
So, I made a deal with the women.
I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side, and we run this as a business and I'll help you.
" They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course, things are always harder than you think they're going to be.
" And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?
" And like -- (Laughter) -- it's a good point.
So then I went the whole American way, with competitions, team and individual.
Completely failed, but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.
And they started listening to the marketplace, and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips, and sorghum bread, and before you knew it, we had cornered the Kigali market, and the women were earning three to four times the national average.
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery, so let's paint it.
" And the women said, "That's a really great idea.
" And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?
" And they said, "Well, you choose.
" But they wouldn't give me an answer.
So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by, and finally I said, "Well, how about blue?
" And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue.
So, blue, blue, everything became blue.
The walls were blue, the windows were blue, the sidewalk out front was painted blue.
And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T," the women's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.
And at the end of it, we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful. " And the women said, "It really is.
" And I said, "And I think the color is perfect," and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence, and I said, "What?
" And she said, "Nothing. " And I said, "What?
" And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green.
" And -- (Laughter) -- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience, but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long, it's really hard to say what you mean.
And, mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.
And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting, but it's also learning how better to ask questions.
And so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things, and it was an extraordinary time in my life.
And it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today, and certainly in the work that I do.
The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice, and that is fundamental to dignity.
But as human beings, we also want to see each other, and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.
The second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty.
I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point, which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty.
Yes, we ran this as a business, but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice and, maybe most important of all, the access to new contacts, networks and new markets.
And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy.
And on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized.
But, having had a father with heart disease, and realizing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten, and having a good friend step in to help, I really believe that all people deserve access to health at prices they can afford.
I think the market can help us figure that out, but there's got to be a charitable component, or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.
And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to build Acumen Fund about six years ago.
It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor, a few oxymorons in one sentence.
We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises, and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs, and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them.
I want to tell you two stories.
Both of them are in Africa.
Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service, and who really know the markets.
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise, and both of them, because they're manufacturers, create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly, because they're in the malaria sector, and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.
And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.
The first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.
It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.
These are old-hand farmers who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in Kenya over the last 30 years.
Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant; it's the basic component for artemisinin, which is the best-known treatment for malaria.
It's indigenous to China and the Far East, but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa, Patrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here, because it's a high value-add product.
" The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.
And so, using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on, that actually got below market returns and was willing to go the long haul and be combined with management assistance, strategic assistance -- they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.
So that's about 50,000 people affected.
And I think some of you may have visited -- these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe, who help them become more self-sufficient.
They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory, which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis, who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make Coartem.
Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half, both on looking at a new business plan, and what does expansion look like, helping with management support and helping to do term sheets and raise capital.
And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so.
Because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem, when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.
And we called all of the social investors we know.
Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa and understand the importance of agriculture, and they even helped the farmers.
And even when we explained that if ABE goes away, all those 7,500 jobs go away too, we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.
This is Samuel.
He's a farmer.
He was actually living in the Kibera slums when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.
So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short, they now have seven acres under cultivation.
Samuel's kids are in private school, and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production -- dignity being more important than wealth.
The next one, many of you know.
I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago, and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing, which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.
It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.
And this is really a story about a public-private solution that has really worked.
It started in Japan.
Sumitomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide, so you could create a bed net, a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.
It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia, it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility, Sumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?
" UNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets, and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's and the U. N. 's commitment to pregnant women and children, for free.
" Acumen came in with the patient capital, and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in Africa, and Exxon provided the initial resin.
Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs, there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah, in A to Z manufacturing company.
It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.
It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania, and continued to flourish.
It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.
And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malaria.
And, long story short, again, they've been so successful.
In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003. We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.
This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year, and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.
They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.
And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa, and from a public health perspective, these are real successes.
But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty, because it's not long-term sustainable.
It's a company with one big customer.
And if avian flu hits, or for any other reason the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.
And so, Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector, because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that, look, in a country like Tanzania, 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.
It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these, and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it, so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.
Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.
And we said, "Well, there's another option.
Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.
We can start building local distribution, and actually, it can cost the public sector much less.
" And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z, a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.
One, that people will pay different prices, but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it.
And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don't like. And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.
But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital, we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector to distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.
So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market, we have a choice.
We've got to start having conversations like this, and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market, but also to bring other people to the table around it.
Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.
She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.
She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor, didn't have very much education.
She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather, who was a cement hauler, and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.
My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop, making shirts for about 10 cents an hour.
She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z, worked hard every day, understood what suffering was, had a deep faith in God, loved her children and would never have accepted a handout.
But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace, and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education, her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams.
I look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as I said, there are a lot of us -- and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.
One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions, get out of our ideological boxes.
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success.
It takes opening your arms, both, wide, and expecting very little love in return, but demanding accountability, and bringing the accountability to the table as well.
And most of all, most of all, it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience, whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African, local or diaspora, left or right, to really start listening to each other.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Twice she was involved in surgeries where they lost power at the hospital. The emergency generators did not start. There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle -- pitch black.
The patient's cut open, twice.
The first time it was a C-section.
Thankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived.
And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again. Start all over again. Now what does this have to do with leadership?
The ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual. And I was part of that. Now, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.
And by the way, it's continued to. The gap has widened since I left. Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred. I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking, persistent, creative, empowered.
Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes. And a month into it, I come to the office, and I have this email from one of our students. And it said, very simply, "I am thinking now. " And he signs off, "Thank you.
We've graduated two classes of students to date. And every single one of them has been placed. And we're getting great reports back from corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa, and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic. You know, that passion for what they're doing.
It's an incredible opportunity.There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation.

Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you. William Kamkwamba: Thanks. CA: So, we've got a picture, I think?
Where is this?
WK: This is my home. This is where I live. CA: Where?
What country?
WK: In Malawi, Kasungu.In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala. CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now?
WK: Yeah. I'm 19 years now. CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that?
WK: I wanted to make a windmill. CA: A windmill? WK: Yeah.
CA: What, to power -- for lighting and stuff?
WK: Yeah. CA: So what did you do?
How did you realize that?
WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power. CA: OK. WK: Yeah. CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better?
WK: Yeah. I test. CA: And what did you make the windmill out of?
What materials did you use?
WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls -- CA: Do we have a picture of that?
Can we have the next slide?
WK: Yeah. The windmill. CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked?
WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates. CA: How much electricity?
WK: 12 watts. CA: And so, that lit a light for the house?
How many lights?
WK: Four bulbs and two radios. CA: Wow. WK: Yeah. (Applause) CA: Next slide -- so who's that?
WK: This is my parents, holding the radio. CA: So what did they make of -- that you were 14, 15 at the time -- what did they make of this?
They were impressed?
WK: Yeah. CA: And so what's your -- what are you going to do with this?
WK: Um -- CA: What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one?
WK: Yeah, I want to build another one -- to pump water and irrigation for crops. CA: So this one would have to be bigger?
WK: Yeah. CA: How big?
WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts. CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village?
WK: Yeah. CA: Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream?
WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah. CA: And as you think of your life going forward, you're 19 now, do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy? WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy.
CA: Wow.William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference. Thank you so much for coming. WK: Thank you. (Applause)Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you. William Kamkwamba: Thanks. CA: So, we've got a picture, I think?

I told you three things last year.
I told you that the statistics of the world have not been made properly available.
Because of that, we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.
And that animated graphics can make a difference.
Things are changing and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page, it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.
(Applause) And if I could share the image with you on the screen.
So three things have happened. U. N. opened their statistic databases, and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net, so you don't have to download it any longer.
And let me repeat what you saw last year.
The bubbles are the countries.
Here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman -- and there you have the length of life in years.
This is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries, those were developing countries.
At that time there was a "we" and "them.
" There was a huge difference in the world.
But then it changed, and it went on quite well.
And this is what happens.
You can see how China is the red, big bubble. The blue there is India.
And they go over all this -- I'm going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how things really changed.
And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?
Large families still, and the HIV epidemic brought down the countries like this.
This is more or less what we saw last year, and this is how it will go on into the future.
Because this is where we are.
Will it be possible that this will happen?
I cover my lifetime here, you know?
I expect to live 100 years.
And this is where we are today.
Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?
And I would like to show that against child survival.
We'll swap the axis. Here you have child mortality -- that is, survival -- four kids dying there, 200 dying there.
And this is GDP per capita on this axis.
And this was 2007. And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics -- here we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.
Some countries still had statistics.
We are looking down in the archive, and when we are down into 1820, there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.
(Laughter) But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.
And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.
So this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.
How they got slowly richer and richer, and they add statistics.
Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics?
You see the importance of that?
And here, children don't live longer.
The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe, because most of this statistics is Europe.
It was only by the turn of the century that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.
This is India coming up, with the first data from India.
And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.
And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.
And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health, not getting so rich.
(Applause) Let us have a look at the United States.
And we can see that the United States goes to the right of the mainstream.
They are on the money side all the time.
And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India -- present, contemporary India.
And that means United States was richer, but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.
And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.
The Philippines of today has almost the same economy as the United States during the First World War.
But we have to bring United States forward quite a while to find the same health of the United States as we have in the Philippines.
About 1957 here, the health of the United States is the same as the Philippines.
And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized, is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America, are much more ahead in being healthy, educated, having human resources than they are economically.
There's a discrepancy in what's happening today in the emerging economies.
There now, social benefits, social progress, are going ahead of economical progress.
And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.
And how long do we have to bring United States to get the same health as Chile has today?
I think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 -- the United States has the same health as Chile.
Chile's catching up!
Within some years Chile may have better child survival than the United States.
This is really a change, that you have this lag of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.
And behind the health is the educational level.
And there's a lot of infrastructure things, and general human resources are there.
Now we can take away this -- and I would like to show you the rate of speed, the rate of change, how fast they have gone. And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.
And I want to look at Sweden and the United States.
And I'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here and the red Toyota down there, and the brownish Volvo.
(Laughter) And here we go. Here we go. The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see, and the United States Ford is going off-road there.
And the Volvo is doing quite fine.
This is the war.
The Toyota got off track, and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden -- can you see that?
And they are taking over Sweden, and they are now healthier than Sweden.
That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.
(Laughter) And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.
They really caught up.
And this changes gradually.
We have to look over generations to understand it.
And let me show you my own sort of family history -- we made these graphs here.
And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?
And this is my family.
This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.
Sweden was like Sierra Leone today.
And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863. And Sweden was like Mozambique.
And this is when my grandma was born, 1891. She took care of me as a child, so I'm not talking about statistic now -- now it's oral history in my family.
That's when I believe statistics, when it's grandma-verified statistics.
(Laughter) I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.
Sweden was like Ghana.
It's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub-Saharan Africa.
I told you last year, I'll tell you again, my mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?
I'm the Mexican in the family.
And my daughter, she was born in Chile, and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore, now the healthiest country on this Earth.
It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago, with better child survival.
But they're very small, you know?
They're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests.
(Laughter) But homage to Singapore. Singapore is the best one.
Now this looks also like a very good story.
But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story. Because I have to show you one of the other facilities.
We can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am I choosing here?
Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.
This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.
And China was emitting 0.6, and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.
And what happens when we moved on?
Well, you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier -- everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.
There is no one who has done it so far.
And we don't have all the updated data any longer, because this is really hot data today.
And there we are, 2001. And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know, many say now the problem is that the emerging economies, they are getting out too much carbon dioxide.
The Minister of the Environment of India said, "Well, you were the one who caused the problem.
" The OECD countries -- the high-income countries -- they were the ones who caused the climate change.
"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.
But from now on, we count per capita. From now on we count per capita.
And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission.
" This really shows you, we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate.
And this is really what has to be changed.
I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world, but I don't think it's like this.
The world is quite a messy place.
This we can call Dollar Street.
Everyone lives on this street here.
What they earn here -- what number they live on -- is how much they earn per day.
This family earns about one dollar per day.
We drive up the street here, we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.
And we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street, and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.
And how do they live?
If we look at the bed here, we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor.
This is what poverty line is -- 80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs, the food for the day.
This is two to five dollars. You have a bed.
And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.
I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here.
(Laughter) And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.
And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama, you see the family still sitting on the floor there.
Although there is a sofa, if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.
It comes beyond here, when you really can get good working conditions in the family.
And if you really want to see the difference, you look at the toilet over here.
This can change.
This can change.These are all pictures and images from Africa, and it can become much better.
We can get out of poverty.
My own research has not been in IT or anything like this.
I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers who were on the verge of famine.
And this is the result of the farmers-needs research.
The nice thing here is that you can't see who are the researchers in this picture.
That's when research functions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people.
When you're in poverty, everything is about survival.
It's about having food.
And these two young farmers, they are girls now -- because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS -- they discuss with a trained agronomist.
This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira, and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant -- the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.
And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice, and that's to survive in poverty.
That's one context.
Getting out of poverty.
The women told us one thing. "Get us technology.
We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.
Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour, then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves.
" Technology will bring you out of poverty, but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.
And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.
But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.
She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market and doesn't have to stay home.
And she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road. It's also good with credit.
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.
And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.
You can do this. I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible.
Africa has not done bad.
In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe, with a functioning nation and state. I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years.
Because we don't consider where they came from.
It's this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago, and says that Mozambique did worse.
We have to know a little more about the world.
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.
He knows everything.
He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.
I only know two types of wine -- red and white.
(Laughter) But my neighbor only knows two types of countries -- industrialized and developing.
And I know 200, I know about the small data.
But you can do that.
(Applause) But I have to get serious.
And how do you get serious?
You make a PowerPoint, you know?
(Laughter) Homage to the Office package, no?
What is this, what is this, what am I telling?
I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.
Everyone wants your pet thing.
If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.
If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization, you love equity between gender.
Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.
On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.
We need everything.
All these things are important for development, especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare.
Now, what we need to think about is, what is a goal for development, and what are the means for development?
Let me first grade what are the most important means.
Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor, is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival. Governance. To have a government which functions -- that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850. It was the government that made law function finally.
Education, human resources are important.
Health is also important, but not that much as a mean.
Environment is important.
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.
We are not interested in money.
Money is not a goal.
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.
Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing, but it's not a goal.
And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.
Health I give two points.
I mean it's nice to be healthy -- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.
And that's good, it gets two plusses.
Environment is very, very crucial.
There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.
But where are the important goals?
Of course, it's human rights.
Human rights is the goal, but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.
And culture.
Culture is the most important thing, I would say, because that's what brings joy to life.
That's the value of living.
So the seemingly impossible is possible.
Even African countries can achieve this.
And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.
And remember, please remember my main message, which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.
We can have a good world.
I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint, and I think I will convince you also by culture.
(Laughter) (Applause) Bring me my sword!
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.
(Laughter) And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel -- this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850, in the last year we had war.
And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.
And I'm going to take this blade of steel, and push it down through my body of blood and flesh, and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.
Can I request a moment of absolute silence?
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Chris.
Everybody who came up here said they were scared.
I don't know if I'm scared, but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.
And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.
There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.
(Laughter) What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa.
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS, the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict, and the Africa of disasters.
While it is true that those things are going on, there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.
And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.
This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.
This is the Africa of opportunity.
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies.
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this. That's what I want to talk about today.
And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa.
On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria, was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family.
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria -- led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.
Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where, according to our constitution, those in office as governors, president -- as in many countries -- have immunity and cannot be prosecuted.
But what happened: people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.
Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite.
And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa -- corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.
Does it mean the problem is over?
The answer is no.
There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.
So when you hear about corruption, don't just feel that nothing is being done about this -- that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption.
That is not the case.
There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing and is being won.
In others, like mine, where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria, the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on.
The results are showing: independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption, and governance is improving.
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.
And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance.
That is that people talk about corruption, corruption.
All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa.
That's the image: African countries.
Is that not corruption?
In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?
So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe -- where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.
I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank, on asset recovery, trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back, it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together.
(Applause) The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.
Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care.
We are grateful, but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us.
We have to do it.
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.
We have to reform our economies, change our leadership, become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.
And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.
In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.
I want to tell you that.
(Laughter) One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian, and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people. You'll never be bored.
(Laughter) What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves.
And with the support of a leader who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms, we put forward a comprehensive reform program, which we developed ourselves.
Not the International Monetary Fund.
Not the World Bank, where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.
No one can do it for you.
You have to do it for yourself.
We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent.
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.
(Applause) We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.
Can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?
(Laughter) Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.
You couldn't get it.
You had to bribe.
You had to do everything to get your phone.
When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.
Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world, after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms.
And nobody knows, except a few smart people.
(Laughter) The smartest one, first to come in, was the MTN company of South Africa.
And in the three years that I was Finance Minister, they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country, with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.
So the market is there.
When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.
Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies, and three or four others have come in.
But there's a huge market out there, and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.
So privatization is one of the things we've done.
The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.
Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well. And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.
So what did we try to do?
We introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price.
We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.
But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.
When they crashed, we crashed.
And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.
That smoothened out.
We were able to save, just before I left, 27 billion dollars.
Whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars.
And as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances.
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy.
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now.
So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.
As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction, and I could go on and on.
And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out, the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.
We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.
We have opportunities in solid minerals.
So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world.
We have opportunities in housing and real estate.
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people -- no shopping malls as you know them here.
This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people.
And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected.
So, huge things in construction, real estate, mortgage markets.
Financial services: we had 89 banks.
Too many not doing their real business.
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital.
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.
The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.
Barclays Bank of the U. K. is bringing in 500 million.
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.
And I can go on.
Dollars, on and on, into the system.
We are doing the same with the insurance sector.
So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.
In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.
And that's what many people know East Africa for: the wildlife, the elephants, and so on.
But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important.
So what am I trying to say?
I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent.
A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000, more than two-thirds of African countries have had multi-party democratic elections.
Not all of them have been perfect, or will be, but the trend is very clear.
I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years, the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.
So it's clear that things are changing.
Conflicts are down on the continent; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago, we are down to three or four conflicts -- one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.
And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent, it looks like the entire continent is affected.
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries, not one country.
And if we are down to three or four conflicts, it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable, growing, exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity.
There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives.
That's not what I'm saying.
That is fine.
But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school, that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet, isn't that a wonderful opportunity?
Isn't that the way to go?
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women.
(Applause) I have a CD here.
I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.
Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.
It says, "Africa: Open for Business.
" And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year.
Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.
But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.
One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi, making children's clothes -- which she started as a hobby and grew into a business.
Mixing African materials, such as we have, with materials from elsewhere.
Very creative designs, has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.
And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.
However, many of these are starved for capital to expand, because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary.
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now, will miss it forever.
So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.
So I invite you to explore the opportunities.
When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago.
This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data.
We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through it, rearranging it in any way we want.
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are.
Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment.
It's also very flexible architecture.
This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data.
This is "Bleak House" by Dickens.
Every column is a chapter.
To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book.
I wouldn't recommend it.
This is a more realistic case, an issue of The Guardian.
Every large image is the beginning of a section.
And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium.
We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian.
We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad -- and we've embedded extra content.
If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate.
We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish like that -- shouldn't be necessary.
Of course, mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this.
And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Seitz at U. W. and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research.
It's powered by Seadragon.
But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful.
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on.
(Applause) (Applause ends) You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft.
This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together.
Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered.
And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory.
Thank you so much.
(Applause) (Applause ends) Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right?
What your software is going to allow, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together?
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering, creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images.
It's doing that based on the content inside the images.
And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have.
Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phrases, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of.
What if that picture links to all of your pictures?
The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge.
It's a classic network effect.
CA: Truly incredible. Congratulations.
Basically, there's a major demographic event going on. And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point.
So the world now is a map of connectivity.
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities. What we have now is the end of the rise of the West.
That's over. The aggregate numbers are overwhelming. So what's really going on?
Well, villages of the world are emptying out. The question is, why?
And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free, they said in Renaissance Germany.
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.Education is the main event that can happen in cities. What's going on in the street in Mumbai?
Al Gore knows.
It's basically everything. There's no unemployment in squatter cities.
Everyone works. One-sixth of humanity is there.
It's soon going to be more than that. So here's the first punch line: cities have defused the population bomb. And here's the second punch line.
That's the news from downtown.
Here it is in perspective.
Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years. Now we're shining right back up. Thank you.
♫ ♫ The flies are the size of your head ♫ ♫ Next to the palm tree, ♫ ♫ Did you see the 'gators ♫ ♫ Looking happy and well fed? ♫ ♫ Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January ♫ (Whistling) Everyone!
And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.
We're all born.
We all bring our children into the world.
We go through initiation rites.
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have art.
But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture.
All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth. And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope.
Now, together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.
It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded, so too is the ethnosphere -- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.
And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.
When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules.
A language is a flash of the human spirit.
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world.
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey, fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.
They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead.
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence, to be the last of your people to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children?
And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue.
And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language?
" And I say, "Great, let's make that language Yoruba.
Let's make it Cantonese.
Let's make it Kogi.
" And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language.
And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "different ways of being," I really do mean different ways of being.
Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon, the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.
Now, this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend.
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called "linguistic exogamy:" you must marry someone who speaks a different language.
And this is all rooted in the mythological past, yet the curious thing is in these long houses, where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language.
They simply listen and then begin to speak.
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with, the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador, an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958. In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake.
They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure, found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.
But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.
They speared each other.
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.
We traced genealogies back eight generations, and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it, they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway.
(Laughter) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing.
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind.
In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies.
In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.
On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.
It's interesting.
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world, what would you say?
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.
There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs.
Well, of course, they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.
But, what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead.
So, the living give birth to the spirits. The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water, responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.
That's why the Voodooists like to say that "You white people go to church and speak about God.
We dance in the temple and become God.
" And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed?
So you see these astonishing demonstrations: Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity, a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.
Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia, in the wake of the conquest, these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.
In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.
To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.
And for this entire time, they are inculturated into the values of their society, values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance.
And the priest steps back and says, "You see?
It's really as I've told you.
It is that beautiful.
It is yours to protect.
" They call themselves the "elder brothers" and they say we, who are the younger brothers, are the ones responsible for destroying the world.
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the "noble savage," which is an idea racist in its simplicity, or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.
Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia.
Now, what does that mean?
Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world.
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut.
Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries.
Take this plant here.
It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire.
What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it.
This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.
If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity.
(Laughter) It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality.
(Laughter) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.
Now, the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine.
So you ask yourself a question.
How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?
Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error," which is exposed to be meaningless.
But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us.
" Well, what does that mean?
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to our eye as one species.
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.
I mean, don't you know anything?
" And I said, "No.
" Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph. D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens.
(Laughter) Now -- (Applause) -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.
Now, the problem isn't change.
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology itself.
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy.
It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere.
It is power, the crude face of domination.
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.
You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but ethnocide, the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned, it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated as part of a development strategy.
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level.
This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion.
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal.
His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy.
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him.
The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp.
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao, and for that transgression, she was given seven years of hard labor.
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.
And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice: do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?
And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for [150,000] years.
The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture, at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old.
Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.
When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish.
And there are great moments of optimism.
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people, and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.
The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s, to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.
This old man's grandfather refused to go.
The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools.
Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold; they took advantage of it.
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide.
So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing.
He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand.
And as the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of a blade.
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness, took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled, harnessed up an adjacent dog, and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.
Talk about getting by with nothing.
(Laughter) And this, in many ways -- (Applause) -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world.
The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.
It's our new homeland.
It's called Nunavut.
It's an independent territory.
They control all mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people.
And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all.
They're homelands of somebody.
They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time.
And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geography of hope.
So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.
We think that polemics -- (Applause) -- we think that polemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world.
We get 35 million hits on our website every month.
156 nations carry our television channel.
Our magazines are read by millions.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes.
And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago. And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family.
And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question. She said, "What leads to success? " And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer.
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED. And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people!
So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and pass it on to kids?
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. And the first thing is passion. Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion.
" TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money. Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do. " And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway. Work!
Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work. Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun. " Did he say fun?
Rupert? Yes! (Laughter) TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard.
I figured, they're not workaholics.
They're workafrolics. (Laughter) Good! (Applause) Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it. " There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice.
And it's focus. Norman Jewison said to me, "I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing.
" And push!
David Gallo says, "Push yourself. Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push. " You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt.
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts.
I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it. " Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers.
(Laughter) (Applause) Frank Gehry said to me, "My mother pushed me. " (Laughter) Serve! Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor.
" A lot of kids want to be millionaires.
The first thing I say is: "OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. Because that's the way people really get rich.
" Ideas! TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company. " I'd say it was a pretty good idea.
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it's just doing some very simple things. And I give lots of evidence. Persist!
Joe Kraus says, "Persistence is the number one reason for our success. " You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap! Which of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure.
And in one generation, for example, Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest.
And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries. So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people, and practice preventive medicine on a global scale.
Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country, but also worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody.
It's not only preventable; it's actually reversible.
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year.
Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids.
What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's preventable.
We're kind of devolving.
(Laughter) Now what can we do about this?
Well, you know, the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet.
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are.
So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies.
They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods, like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business.
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad.
At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods.
And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu.
Thank you.
I'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society, publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.
We investigate claims of the paranormal, pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults, and claims of all kinds between, science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science, voodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science, and plain old non-sense.
And unless you've been on Mars recently, you know there's a lot of that out there.
Some people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative term.
But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk. We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there -- well, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas, (Laughter) trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas.
I'll show you an example of a bad idea.
I brought this with me, this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.
It's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia.
It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.
(Laughter) This was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece.
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.
You could dowse for all sorts of things, but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers.
(Laughter) So the way it works is you go down the hallway, and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker, and then you open the locker.
So it looks something like this.
I'll show you.
(Laughter) Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.
Well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment.
It'll go this way for sure.
(Laughter) Sir, do you want to empty your pockets, please, sir?
(Laughter) So the question was, can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers?
And the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes.
(Laughter) (Applause) But in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits.
And that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here: This is how psychics work, astrologers, tarot card readers and so on.
People remember the hits and forget the misses.
In science, we keep the whole database, and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number you'd expect by chance.
In this case, we tested it.
We had two opaque boxes: one with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing.
And it got it 50 percent of the time -- (Laughter) which is exactly what you'd expect with a coin-flip model.
So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.
"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication.
Each one has a particular theme. This one is on the future of intelligence.
Are people getting smarter or dumber?
I have an opinion of this myself because of the business I'm in, but in fact, people, it turns out, are getting smarter.
Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.
Sort of an interesting thing.
With science, don't think of skepticism as a thing, or science as a thing.
Are science and religion compatible?
It's like, are science and plumbing compatible?
They're just two different things.
Science is not a thing.
It's a verb.
It's a way of thinking about things.
It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.
I mean, what's more likely: that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush, Kansas to promote skeptic. com, our web page?
Or is it more likely that a reader of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?
And in all cases we have to ask -- (Laughter) What's the more likely explanation?
Before we say something is out of this world, we should first make sure that it's not in this world.
What's more likely: that Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship, or that the "World Weekly News" makes stuff up?
(Laughter) The same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.
For those of you in the back, it says here: "Then a miracle occurs.
I think you need to be more explicit here in step two. " This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments. There's nothing more to it than that.
(Applause) You can say a miracle occurs, it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything.
There's nothing to test.
It's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists.
And it's true, scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter, something like that -- until we figure out what it is, we'll call it this. It's the beginning of the causal chain for science.
For intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain.
So again, we can ask this: what's more likely?
Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?
This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California, looking down over Pasadena.
And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is.
You don't even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment, you don't need computers.
This was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera.
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go.
Camera's ready -- that's it.
(Laughter) So, although it's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on, and that some of them are real, it's more likely that all of them are fake, like the crop circles.
On a more serious note, in all of science we're looking for a balance between data and theory.
In the case of Galileo, he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn.
First of all, there was no theory of planetary rings.
Second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy, and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at.
So he wrote that he had seen -- "I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies. " And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw.
So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data, you can't have a good theory.
It wasn't solved until 1655. This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.
And we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there.
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.
The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases.
So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things, on a simple level, and then I'll go to more serious ones.
Like, we have a tendency to see faces.
This is the face on Mars. In 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians.
Here's the close-up of it from 2001. If you squint, you can still see the face.
And when you're squinting, you're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain, so you're reducing the quality of your data.
And if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face, because we're programmed by evolution to see faces.
Faces are important for us socially.
And of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see.
You see the happy face on Mars, there.
(Laughter) If astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.
Do you see him there?
Little froggy legs.
Or if geologists were elephants?
Religious iconography.
(Laughter) Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996. He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer.
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street, or is it up the street from here?
Tree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy, black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking -- humans are pattern-seeking animals.
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.
Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich -- which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino -- of course, this being America.
(Laughter) This casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich.
(Laughter) But who does it really look like? The Virgin Mary?
(Laughter) It has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look.
Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.
I actually went to see this one.
There was a lot of people there. The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on.
We went down and investigated.
Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.
I guess you can only have one miracle per building.
(Laughter) So is it really a miracle of Mary, or is it a miracle of Marge?
(Laughter) And now I'm going to finish up with another example of this, with auditory illusions.
There's this film, "White Noise," with Michael Keaton, about the dead talking back to us.
By the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal.
Anybody can do it, turns out.
It's getting the dead to talk back that's the really hard part.
(Laughter) In this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena.
There's a ReverseSpeech. com web page where I downloaded this stuff.
This is the most famous one of all of these.
Here's the forward version of the very famous song.
All right, here it is backwards, and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there.
(Music with unintelligible lyrics) (Lyrics) Satan! (Unintelligible lyrics continue) What did you get?
Audience: Satan! Satan. OK, at least we got "Satan". Now, I'll prime the auditory part of your brain to tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again.
(Music with lyrics) (Music ends) (Laughter) (Applause) You can't miss it when I tell you what's there.
(Laughter) I'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story. The Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization.
We're always looking for little good things that people do.
And in England, there's a pop singer.
One of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.
And she wrote a beautiful song.
It was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing. " It's a love story -- she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK -- about how she much loves her guy, and compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth.
And she has this one passage here.
(Music) (Lyrics) We are 12 billion light-years from the edge That's a guess, No one can ever say it's true, But I know that I will always be with you. Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice.
At least she got it close.
In America it'd be, "We're 6,000 light years from the edge. " (Laughter) But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator, who wrote the book "The Big Bang," and so on, uses every chance he gets to promote good science.
And so he wrote an op-ed piece in "The Guardian" about Katie's song, in which he said, well, we know exactly how far from the edge.
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess.
We know within precise error bars how close it is.
So we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true.
And, to his credit, Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out, and said, "I'm so embarrassed.
I was in the astronomy club. I should've known better. " And she re-cut the song.
So I will end with the new version.
(Music with lyrics) We are 13.7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe. That's a good estimate with well-defined error bars. And with the available information, I predict that I will always be with you. (Laughter) How cool is that?
(Applause)I'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society, publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.
We investigate claims of the paranormal, pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults, and claims of all kinds between, science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science, voodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science, and plain old non-sense.

Second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy, and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at.
So he wrote that he had seen -- "I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies. " And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw.
So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data, you can't have a good theory.
It wasn't solved until 1655. This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.
And we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there.
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.
The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases.
So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things, on a simple level, and then I'll go to more serious ones.
Like, we have a tendency to see faces.
This is the face on Mars. In 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians.
Here's the close-up of it from 2001. If you squint, you can still see the face.
And when you're squinting, you're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain, so you're reducing the quality of your data.
And if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face, because we're programmed by evolution to see faces.
Faces are important for us socially.
And of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see.
You see the happy face on Mars, there.
(Laughter) If astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.
Do you see him there?
Religious iconography.
(Laughter) Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996. He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer.
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street, or is it up the street from here?
Tree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy, black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking -- humans are pattern-seeking animals.
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.
Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich -- which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino -- of course, this being America.
(Laughter) This casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich.
(Laughter) But who does it really look like? The Virgin Mary?
(Laughter) It has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look.
Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.
I actually went to see this one.
There was a lot of people there. The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on.
We went down and investigated.
Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.
(Laughter) And now I'm going to finish up with another example of this, with auditory illusions.
There's this film, "White Noise," with Michael Keaton, about the dead talking back to us.
By the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal.
(Laughter) In this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena.
There's a ReverseSpeech. com web page where I downloaded this stuff.
This is the most famous one of all of these.
Here's the forward version of the very famous song.
All right, here it is backwards, and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there.
(Music with unintelligible lyrics) (Lyrics) Satan! (Unintelligible lyrics continue) What did you get?
Audience: Satan! Satan. OK, at least we got "Satan". Now, I'll prime the auditory part of your brain to tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again.
(Music with lyrics) (Music ends) (Laughter) (Applause) You can't miss it when I tell you what's there.
(Laughter) I'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story. The Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization.
We're always looking for little good things that people do.
And in England, there's a pop singer.
One of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.
And she wrote a beautiful song.
It was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing. " It's a love story -- she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK -- about how she much loves her guy, and compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth.
And she has this one passage here.
(Music) (Lyrics) We are 12 billion light-years from the edge That's a guess, No one can ever say it's true, But I know that I will always be with you. Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice.
At least she got it close.
In America it'd be, "We're 6,000 light years from the edge. " (Laughter) But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator, who wrote the book "The Big Bang," and so on, uses every chance he gets to promote good science.
And so he wrote an op-ed piece in "The Guardian" about Katie's song, in which he said, well, we know exactly how far from the edge.
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess.
We know within precise error bars how close it is.
So we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true.
And, to his credit, Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out, and said, "I'm so embarrassed.
I was in the astronomy club. I should've known better. " And she re-cut the song.
So I will end with the new version.
(Music with lyrics) We are 13.7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe. That's a good estimate with well-defined error bars. And with the available information, I predict that I will always be with you. (Laughter) How cool is that?
(Applause)
I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.
We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space.
In fact, we've regressed.
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done.
And that is, instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.
And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it.
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs.
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future.
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.
We're going to go back to the moon . . . 50 years later? And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.
I'm really troubled by that.
But anyway that's -- the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though, is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later.
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young: three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.
What they look at is the most important thing.
Let's take a snapshot at aviation.
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened.
It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, "Ooh, hey, I can do that.
" There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots.
Airplanes were invented by natural selection.
Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.
There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.
The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition.
So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today.
And that's why they're so safe, as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.
That has not happened at all in space flying.
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U. S. and one by the Russians.
Well, who was inspired during that time period?
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.
The jet age started: the missile age started.
Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now.
We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?
But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts.
(Laughter) If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew, and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport.
You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid -- and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.
Well, what did I do when I was a kid?
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days.
But I did competition model airplanes.
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages.
And some 3,000 of those are flying.
Of course, one of them is around the world Voyager.
I founded another company in '82, which is my company now.
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982. And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.
The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet.
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander.
It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool.
We've lost that capability.
These things tend to happen every 25 years. 40 years long, with an overlap.
You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies.
The interesting thing -- by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles.
There is none here.
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it.
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net. Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it.
Private sector has to do it.
Keep that in mind.
I put down innovation -- I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.
The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space, and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year.
In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.
There were only three or four flights in 2003. In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station.
And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five, which was the number the same year back in 1961. There is no growth.
There's no activity. There's no nothing.
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.
This is a picture here taken from orbit.
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company.
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?
The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.
There's another one announced just last week.
And it will be sub-orbital.
And the reason it has to be sub-orbital is, there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit.
The governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years, and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.
It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020. I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.
But I think once it does, we will find solutions, and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.
Oh, it's going to be so much fun.
(Laughter) OK.
My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.
What's this?
This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun.
" And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute.
I bought my first Apple computer in 1978 and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.
'What do you use it for?
' Come over.
It does Frogger.
" OK.
(Laughter) Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer, but the home computer was for games.
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.
But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry, big development, big improvement and capability and so on, and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.
And the inventor is in this audience.
(Laughter) And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homes.
So fun is defendable.
OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart, but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.
And in it also brings up another point, right here.
And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.
They were inspired by big progress.
But look at the progress that's going on after that.
There were a couple of examples here.
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, and was taken out of service.
The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.
It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service.
And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.
But something is out there to inspire our kids now.
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now.
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.
Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane.
It's never happened before.
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better?
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute, what's happening here, we'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.
OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.
You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones.
We didn't lose them technically.
The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it -- you can argue that's not a technical loss.
Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing.
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever.
So we had the capability.
But America lost.
We lost.
And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.
Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.
They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians?
Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire?
Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry.
Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.
And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered.
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.
This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already, worldwide.
If you read -- if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed and planned for the next few years.
Hey, that's pretty big.
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable.
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U. S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.
And that is because it's us.
It's private industry.
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- and we've done it for a long time.
The NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.
But starting back in June of 2004, when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.
OK, thank you very much.
(Applause)I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.
We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space.
In fact, we've regressed.
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done.

You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.
You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available because a Russian space program is starving, and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.
It's commercial.
It can be defined as space tourism.
They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians?
Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire?
Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry.
Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.
And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered.
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.
This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already, worldwide.
If you read -- if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed and planned for the next few years.
Hey, that's pretty big.
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable.
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U. S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.
And that is because it's us.
It's private industry.
The NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.
But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK.
And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it.
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- at least I thought it was beautiful.
And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach, and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest, that were also fuzzy.
And I wore it whenever I could, thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.
Until one day in ninth grade, when I was standing with a number of the football players.
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously, my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again.
And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know.
Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.
We were called the "Bad News Bears," and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali, which was not hard because there were no snacks before us.
And because we had a good business model, we actually did it, and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.
Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.
And at the same time, what keeps me up at night is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 -- 50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa, 40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory, as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.
And it was that -- that whole philosophy -- that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called "Acumen Fund," which is trying to build some mini-blueprints for how we might do that in water, health and housing in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.
On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.
Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.
But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms, so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.
A couple of principles: build small.
After one harvest, they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.
The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets, three million by the end of the year.
On the distribution side, though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do.
We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.
Their women.
Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives.
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor.
Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement.
Thank you.
(Applause)I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin, from when I was 12 years old.
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- at least I thought it was beautiful.
Until one day in ninth grade, when I was standing with a number of the football players.
And my body had clearly changed, and Matt, who was undeniably my nemesis in high school, said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips, but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.
But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course scaring the living bejesus out of him -- grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater.
And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industry.
Not to say that it shouldn't have, but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses.
So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986, where I was doing two things.
I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.
We were called the "Bad News Bears," and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali, which was not hard because there were no snacks before us.
And because we had a good business model, we actually did it, and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.
We got a lot of things right.
We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses, earn more income so they could take care of their families better.
What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us, with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda, that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.
The genocide happened in 1994, seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream.
And the good news was that the institution, the banking institution, lasted.
In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.
The bakery was completely wiped out, but the lessons for me were that accountability counts -- got to build things with people on the ground, using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say, the incentives matter.
Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.
It's thrilling.
And at the same time, what keeps me up at night is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 -- 50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa, 40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory, as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.
And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one, celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution, all about the how-to.
If we do that, we really can make poverty history.
And it was that -- that whole philosophy -- that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called "Acumen Fund," which is trying to build some mini-blueprints for how we might do that in water, health and housing in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.
And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples, so you can see what it is that we're doing.
But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves -- I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.
Because we too often talk about them as these strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free, when in fact, it's quite an amazing story.
On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.
That's who we talk about when we think about "the poor.
" If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth, and yet most of these people go invisible.
Where we typically work, there's people making between one and three dollars a day.
Who are these people?
They are farmers and factory workers.
They work in government offices.
They're drivers.
They are domestics.
They typically pay for critical goods and services like water, like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times what their middleclass counterparts pay -- certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.
The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions, if you give them that opportunity.
So, two examples.
One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than two dollars a day.
Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.
What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches, and figure out how to do a drip irrigation, which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.
But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms, so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.
A couple of principles: build small.
Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.
This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to with a corrugated iron roof.
After one harvest, they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.
A couple of years later, I meet them.
They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India, and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house.
And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.
Something I truly believe.
You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets, and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life.
Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.
300 to 500 million cases are reported.
Five dollars can save a life.
We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars -- why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?
The question, though, is not "Why can't we? " The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?
A lot of hurdles.
One: production is too low.
Two: price is too high.
Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located.
Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.
We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long-lasting, five-year nets.
Here are just some pictures of the factory.
Today, three years later, the company has employed another thousand women.
It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.
It's the largest company in Tanzania.
The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets, three million by the end of the year.
We hope to have seven million at the end of next year.
So the production side is working.
On the distribution side, though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do.
Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U. N. , and then given primarily to people around Africa.
We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.
Their women.
And so I want you to meet Jacqueline, my namesake, 21 years old.
If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania, I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.
She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house.
She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund, and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed.
We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies, and quickly did a prototyping on this, and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things.
Not coming in with our own notions, because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.
First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.
These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.
Children can sleep through the night; the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.
And we've started making curtains, and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status -- that you care about your children.
Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives.
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor.
I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history.
To do it right, we have to build business models that matter, that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians, people all over the developing world who fit in this category, to do it themselves.
Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement.
It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, that they want to make their own decisions; they want to solve their own problems; and that by engaging with them, not only do we create much more dignity for them, but for us as well.
Thank you.
(Applause)
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point where I get this thing to work.
Here we go.
I'm going to talk about five different things.
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together, and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging.
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong, namely, by actually doing something about it.
Now, I want to ask a question.
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?
That was easy. OK. OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing? OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
And here is that characteristic.
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially, to talk about the comparison with foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle, by the government not very many months ago.
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know, city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.
It's a traditional part of the way of life, and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes.
" But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end, because the majority of the British public, and certainly the majority of members of Parliament, came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades.
What part of this do people not understand?
It's not just about life, of course -- (Laughter) -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.
It's a global trance.
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging.
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless.
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.
But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion.
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about.
But the question is, are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite, namely, leaving aging as it is?
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say.
(Laughter) Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.
People worry about overpopulation; they say, "Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people.
" And that's true.
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this.
I don't agree with those answers.
I think they basically don't work.
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate.
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies, in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.
And, I say that that's fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.
That's my answer to the overpopulation question. Right. So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this?
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all.
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem.
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot -- in order to get people's attention, and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard.
So that's all I'm going to say about that.
I'm now going to talk about feasibility. And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.
A very simple definition.
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism.
This is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement.
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars, and it also happens to us, despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms, because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effects.
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.
That's a fine definition.
So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.
And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach.
" The geriatrician will intervene late in the day, when pathology is becoming evident, and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time, and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon.
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle, because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on.
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure.
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we're not really too good on yet.
We've discovered things like, for example, RNA interference only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention.
So then, what do we do about that?
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it?
But it isn't.
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two.
" OK.
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple, but it's not simple. We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer.
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.
There are two sorts of technological progress really, for this purpose.
Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames.
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough.
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun, and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight.
We can think, really, that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore.
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later.
You can look at medical care.
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
This is a very important point for me to get across.
I'm not saying that at all.
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough.
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.
" (Laughter) Well, it seems to get the point across.
But irrespective of that age, I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes -- is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.
So, in other words, we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan, starting from the point that we started the therapies.
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?
Which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame, in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities.
15 years from the robust mouse.
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.
We can call it the "engineering approach," and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle, and it's something that we are within range of being able to do, because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.
Why do I say that we're in range?
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another. This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.
The list on the right is also incomplete.
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list.
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it.
We do need to really start trying.
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true.
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible.
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter, doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals, living a long time or by procreation, there's a certain amount of modulation of that, which is why different species have different lifespans, but that's why there are no immortal species.
Here we go.
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
And here is that characteristic.
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially, to talk about the comparison with foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle, by the government not very many months ago.

Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle, because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on.
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure.
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we're not really too good on yet.
We've discovered things like, for example, RNA interference only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention.
So then, what do we do about that?
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it?
But it isn't.
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two.
" OK.
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live?
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple, but it's not simple. We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer.
" That's the wrong answer.
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.
There are two sorts of technological progress really, for this purpose.
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.
Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames.
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough.
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun, and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight.
We can think, really, that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore.
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later.
You can look at medical care.
I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics -- you know, the same sort of time frame. So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all.
That in fact, the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive, will be at some sort of cusp.
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.
This is a very important point for me to get across.
I'm not saying that at all.
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough.
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.
I decided to give this a little name, which is "longevity escape velocity.
" (Laughter) Well, it seems to get the point across.
So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live, in terms of remaining life expectancy, as measured by their health, for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.
You won't be able to withstand them.
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old -- we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies.
But irrespective of that age, I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes -- is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.
And that's quite a thought.
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk, my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one; namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity?
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.
And this is what it is.
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average.
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them, and with those therapies, we get them to live, on average, to their fifth birthday.
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things, starting from the time we get the mice?
I say that's nonsense.
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.
15 years from the robust mouse.
That will be history at this point, because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans, since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.
But it is not part of metabolism itself.
The engineering approach simply says, "Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot, so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic.
Why do I say that we're in range?
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list.
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage, side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end, or that might cause pathology.
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it.
And we'll just end with a few things.
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible.
So, you know, this does happen.
This is what's going to take a bit of money.
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?
(Laughter) Your numbers are a bit out.
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.
Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that.
Of course, I hope I can memorize it. (Clears throat) The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings.
By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but . . . let me think.
(Laughter) Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave.
(Sighs) Oh, my gosh!
(Laughter) OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology.
But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound.
Isn't that cool?
(Laughter) (Applause) Design -- I love its design. I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, "Would you like to play the violin or the piano?
" I looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- "I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!
" (Laughter) This is small and lightweight.
I can play from standing, sitting or walking.
And, you know what?
The best of all is that if I don't want to practice, (Whispering) I can hide it. (Laughter) The violin is very beautiful.
Some people relate it as the shape of a lady. But whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated.
But I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same -- even from the same maker or based on the same model.
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment. But actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining.
I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids -- it was so horrible and so scratchy. So, it wasn't entertaining at all.
But besides, my brother found this very funny: Yuk!
Yuk! Yuk! (Laughter) A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz.
After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: "Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!
" And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, "Funny -- I don't hear anything.
" (Laughter) Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment.
Now I know why I'm here.
(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) At first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more.
But . . . although some of the talks were quite up there for me.
(Laughter) Like the multi-dimension stuff.
I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.
(Laughter) But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that -- well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) (Applause ends) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause)(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) (Applause ends) Hi, everyone.
I'm Sirena.
I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.
(Audience cheers) (Applause) Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.
(Laughter) I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design?
Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that.
So I did a little research on it.
Well, this is what I found.
Of course, I hope I can memorize it. (Clears throat) The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings.

About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students.
That was after having spent about 20 years, together with African institutions, studying hunger in Africa. So I was sort of expected to know a little about the world.
And I started, in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health.
But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous.
I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in the Swedish college system, so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about.
So I did a pretest when they came.
And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: "Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?
" And I put them together so that in each pair of countries, one has twice the child mortality of the other.
And this means that it's much bigger, the difference, than the uncertainty of the data.
I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.
And these were the results of the Swedish students.
I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow. And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8 right answer out of five possible.
That means there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course.
(Laughter) But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery.
I have shown that Swedish top students know, statistically, significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees.
(Laughter) Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey.
They would be right half of the cases.
But the students are not there.
The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas.
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, which hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.
(Laughter) This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware.
So we did this software, which displays it like this. Every bubble here is a country.
This country over here is China.
This is India.
The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate.
Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, "What do you really think about the world?
" Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.
(Laughter) And they said, "The world is still 'we' and 'them.
' And 'we' is the Western world and 'them' is the Third World.
" "And what do you mean with 'Western world?
'" I said.
"Well, that's long life and small family. And 'Third World' is short life and large family.
" So this is what I could display here.
I put fertility rate here -- number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman.
We have very good data since 1962, 1960, about, on the size of families in all countries.
The error margin is narrow.
Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries, up to about 70 years.
And in 1962, there was really a group of countries here that were industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives.
And these were the developing countries. They had large families and they had relatively short lives.
Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change.
Are the students right?
It's still two types of countries?
Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here?
Or have they got longer lives and live up there?
Let's see.
We start the world, eh?
This is all UN statistics that have been available.
Here we go.
Can you see there?
It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there.
All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families.
Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families.
The Africans are the green here.
They still remain here.
This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.
In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries.
But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle that happens in the '80s -- the imams start to promote family planning, and they move up into that corner.
And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries. And the rest of them all move up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world.
(Applause) (Applause ends) Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam.
1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens. The data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy.
By the end of the year, family planning started in Vietnam, and they went for smaller families.
I think we all, if we don't look at the data, we underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economic change.
So let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of income.
This is the world distribution of income of people.
One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day.
There's no gap between rich and poor any longer.
This is a myth.
There's a little hump here.
But there are people all the way.
We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income.
We heard it in other forms.
And who are these?
Where are the different countries?
I can show you Africa.
This is Africa. Ten percent of the world population, most in poverty.
This is OECD -- the rich countries, the country club of the UN.
And they are over here on this side.
Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.
And this is Latin America.
It has everything on this earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia.
And what did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? Then, there was more of a hump.
And most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians.
The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia.
And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increases, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty, and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today.
And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world.
We'll have most people in the middle.
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent.
We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase.
If I change this and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population.
In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
The linearity is very strong between child survival and money.
But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.
Health is there and better health is up there.
I can go here, and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it bursts, the size of each country bubble is the size of the population.
Sierra Leone down there, Mauritius is up there.
Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar, they could sell their textiles, on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.
There's a huge difference [within] Africa.
And Ghana is here in the middle.
In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday.
There's tremendous variation within Africa, which we very often make that it's equal everything.
I can split South Asia here.
India's the big bubble in the middle.
But there's a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states.
How are they?
Same climate, same culture, same religion -- huge difference.
Even between neighbors -- Yemen, civil war; United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well-used.
Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country.
Data is often better than you think.
Many people say data is bad.
There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore.
The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data.
East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently.
And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America.
Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now.
Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.
And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this.
And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move.
This is Mao Zedong. He brought health to China. And then he died.
And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again.
And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world.
But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one.
The label went away for me here.
And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. I can run it forward, like this.
And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower.
They came from here, a mineral country.
They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket.
You have to invest in health.
You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff.
You have to educate the population.
And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way.
In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here.
So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used it in the past.
Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this.
That's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries.
So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda.
These are the quintiles of Uganda.
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there.
The poorest are down there.
If I split South Africa, it's like this.
Everything in this world exists in Africa.
And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [treatment] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here.
The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on a regional level. We must be much more detailed.
We find that students get very excited when they can use this.
And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing.
Now, why doesn't this take place?
Why are we not using the data we have?
We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other nongovernmental organizations.
Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there, and the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively.
All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics.
There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.
(Laughter) And this won't work.
(Applause) So what is needed?
We have the databases.
It's not a new database that you need.
We have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here.
So we started a nonprofit venture linking data to design, we called "Gapminder," from the London Underground, where they warn you, "Mind the gap. " So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.
And we started to write software which could link the data like this.
And it wasn't that difficult.
It took some person years, and we have produced animations.
You can take a data set and put it there.
We are liberating UN data, some few UN organization.
And what do we hear when we go around?
I've done anthropology on the main statistical units.
This can't be done.
Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.
" But this is what we would like to see, isn't it?
The publicly funded data is down here.
And we would like flowers to grow out on the net.
And I have pretty good news for you.
I have good news that the [current], new head of UN statistics doesn't say it's impossible.
He only says, "We can't do it.
(Laughter) So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years.
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.
This is the income distribution of China, 1970. This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap.
Almost no overlap. And what has happened?
What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States, almost like a ghost, isn't it?
(Laughter) It's pretty scary.
(Laughter) But I think it's very important to have all this information.
We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily.
It takes some time to change for this, but on the axes, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have.
And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them.
I end now with the world. There, the internet is coming.
And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries.
That's why the $100 computer will be so important.
These countries are lifting more than the economy, and it will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.
(Applause)About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students.

And these were the developing countries. They had large families and they had relatively short lives.

Are the students right?
Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here?
Or have they got longer lives and live up there?
Let's see.
We start the world, eh?
This is all UN statistics that have been available.
Here we go.
Can you see there?
All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families.
Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families.
The Africans are the green here.
They still remain here.
This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.
(Applause) (Applause ends) Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam.
1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens. The data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy.
So let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of income.
This is the world distribution of income of people.
But there are people all the way.
We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income.
And who are these?
Where are the different countries?
This is Africa. Ten percent of the world population, most in poverty.
And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world.
We'll have most people in the middle.
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent.
We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase.
If I change this and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population.
In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
The linearity is very strong between child survival and money.
But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.
Health is there and better health is up there.
I can go here, and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it bursts, the size of each country bubble is the size of the population.
Sierra Leone down there, Mauritius is up there.
Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar, they could sell their textiles, on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.
There's a huge difference [within] Africa.
And Ghana is here in the middle.
In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday.
There's tremendous variation within Africa, which we very often make that it's equal everything.
I can split South Asia here.
India's the big bubble in the middle.
But there's a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states.
How are they?
Same climate, same culture, same religion -- huge difference.
Even between neighbors -- Yemen, civil war; United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well-used.
Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country.
Data is often better than you think.
Many people say data is bad.
There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore.
The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data.
East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently.
And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America.
Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now.
Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.
And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this.
And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move.
This is Mao Zedong. He brought health to China. And then he died.
And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again.
And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world.
But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one.
The label went away for me here.
And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. I can run it forward, like this.
And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower.
They came from here, a mineral country.
They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket.
You have to invest in health.
You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff.
You have to educate the population.
And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way.
In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here.
So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used it in the past.
Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this.
That's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries.
These are the quintiles of Uganda.
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there.
The poorest are down there.
If I split South Africa, it's like this.
Everything in this world exists in Africa.
And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [treatment] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here.
The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on a regional level. We must be much more detailed.
We find that students get very excited when they can use this.
And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing.
Now, why doesn't this take place?
Why are we not using the data we have?
We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other nongovernmental organizations.
Because the data is hidden down in the databases. 
And the public is there, and the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively.
All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics.
There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.
(Laughter) And this won't work.
(Applause) So what is needed?
We have the databases.
It's not a new database that you need.
We have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here.
So we started a nonprofit venture linking data to design, we called "Gapminder," from the London Underground, where they warn you, "Mind the gap. " So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.
And we started to write software which could link the data like this.
And it wasn't that difficult.
It took some person years, and we have produced animations.
You can take a data set and put it there.
We are liberating UN data, some few UN organization.
Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world. But what we really need is, of course, a search function, a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world.
And what do we hear when we go around?
I've done anthropology on the main statistical units.
Everyone says, "It's impossible.
This can't be done.
Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.
" But this is what we would like to see, isn't it?
The publicly funded data is down here.
And we would like flowers to grow out on the net.
One of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tools to animate it there.
And I have pretty good news for you.
I have good news that the [current], new head of UN statistics doesn't say it's impossible.
He only says, "We can't do it.
" (Laughter) And that's a quite clever guy, huh?
(Laughter) So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years.
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.
This is the income distribution of China, 1970. This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap.
Almost no overlap. And what has happened?
What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States, almost like a ghost, isn't it?
(Laughter) It's pretty scary.
(Laughter) But I think it's very important to have all this information.
We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily.
It takes some time to change for this, but on the axes, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have.
And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them.
Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods. But this is hypothesis-generating.
I end now with the world. There, the internet is coming.
The number of internet users are going up like this.
This is the GDP per capita.
And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries.
That's why the $100 computer will be so important.
But it's a nice tendency.
It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it?
These countries are lifting more than the economy, and it will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves.
However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City.
And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.
The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive.
I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier.
Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.
There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.
I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.
And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.
We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years.
We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park.
And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.
(Audience whistles) Thank you very much.
(Applause) That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.
(Laughter) (Applause) But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine.
We feel the problems right now, and have for some time.
Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other.
Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities.
As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health.
I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do.
These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma.
Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?
Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it.
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma.
Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average.
These impacts are coming everyone's way.
And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential.
Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed.
Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care.
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.
Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.
Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term.
None of us want that, and we all have that in common.
So what else do we have in common?
Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.
(Laughter) Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good. (Laughter) But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways.
I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down.
My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street.
Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto.
These things make me different from you.
But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.
So how did things get so different for us?
In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom.
At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.
My dad was not alone.
And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country.
Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment.
Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.
Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems.
In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.
The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance.
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed.
600,000 people were displaced.
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.
And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you?
So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had.
And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.
Now, why is this story important?
Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation.
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come.
Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?
What costs are associated with these decisions?
And who pays?
Who profits?
Does anything justify what the local community goes through?
This was "planning" -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind.
Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning.
That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths.
Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life.
They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development.
Think bike shops, juice stands.
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects.
This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.
And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.
Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.
As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.
We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs.
Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment.
The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.
Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused.
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway.
We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.
We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices.
Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere.
Green roofs are soil and living plants.
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe.
Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine.
And they provide habitats for our little friends!
[Butterfly] (Laughter) So cool!
Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.
[Green is the new black . . . ] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too.
Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors.
End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
Anyway -- (Laughter) (Applause) OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common.
Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another.
In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.
We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability.
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out.
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone.
Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did?
Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?
Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral.
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit.
You've no clue.
But I'll tell you later, if you want to know. (Laughter) But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end.
I'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line" that sustainable development can produce.
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.
At present, that's not happening in New York City.
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit.
A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space.
And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny.
Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks.
Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier.
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit.
Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes.
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.
Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development.
Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve.
And I've embraced my inner capitalist.
And, but I don't have -- (Laughter) You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.
(Laughter) So I don't have a problem with developers making money.
There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune.
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that.
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit.
That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create.
But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities.
This is my version of globalization.
Let's take Bogota.
Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.
However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa.
He looked at the demographics.
If you're a mayor, you can do something about that.
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world.
For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached.
But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened.
People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people.
His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that.
But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence.
That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U. S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that.
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange.
Don't just talk about it at TED.
This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal.
Help me make sustainability sexy.
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations.
Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.
Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy.
His response was a grant program.
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding.
Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.
Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.
(Applause) I have come from so far to meet you like this.
Please don't waste me.
By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world.
However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City.
And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.

That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths.
Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life.
They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development.
Think bike shops, juice stands.
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects.
This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.
And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.
Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.
As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.
We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs.
Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment.
The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.
Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused.
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway.
We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.
We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices.
Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere.
Green roofs are soil and living plants.
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe.
Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine.
And they provide habitats for our little friends!
[Butterfly] (Laughter) So cool!
Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.
[Green is the new black . . . ] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too.
Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors.
End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
Anyway -- (Laughter) (Applause) OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common.
Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another.
In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.
We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability.
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out.
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone.
Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did?
Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?
Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral.
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit.
You've no clue.
But I'll tell you later, if you want to know. (Laughter) But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end.
I'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line" that sustainable development can produce.
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.
At present, that's not happening in New York City.
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit.
A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space.
And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny.
Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks.
Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier.
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit.
Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes.
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.
Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development.
Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve.
And I've embraced my inner capitalist.
And, but I don't have -- (Laughter) You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.
(Laughter) So I don't have a problem with developers making money.
There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune.
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that.
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit.
That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create.
But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities.
This is my version of globalization.
Let's take Bogota.
Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.
However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa.
He looked at the demographics.
Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them.
If you're a mayor, you can do something about that.
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world.
For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached.
But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened.
People stopped littering. 
Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people.
His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that.
We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry.
But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence.
That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U. S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that.
You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence.
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange.
Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere.
Don't just talk about it at TED.
This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal.
Help me make green the new black.
Help me make sustainability sexy.
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations.
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice.
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return.
Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.
Oh good, glad I have a little more time!
Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy.
His response was a grant program.
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding.
I was making him an offer.
(Applause) What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around.
Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.
(Laughter) But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process.
Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.
(Applause) I have come from so far to meet you like this.
Please don't waste me.
By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world.
We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
Ciao, bellos! (Applause)
Thank you so much, Chris.
And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful.
I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night.
And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that.
(Laughter) Put yourselves in my position.
(Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. (Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!
(Laughter) (Applause) I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.
(Laughter) It's a true story -- every bit of this is true.
There was no motorcade back there.
(Laughter) You've heard of phantom limb pain?
(Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus.
(Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat.
We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant.
Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it.
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.
I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.
I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling.
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway.
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, "Call Washington!
Call Washington!
" And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington?
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.
(Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America.
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.
'" (Laughter) Before I could get back to U. S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!
" (Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, "Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!
" (Laughter) We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.
(Laughter) I was going to talk about information ecology. 
But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: It's a deal!
(Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis?
I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five.
Now, the slide show.
I update the slide show every time I give it.
I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know?
Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells.
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees.
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit.
Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit.
The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive.
These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.
Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective.
It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks.
Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that.
But it's part of the puzzle.
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks.
Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable.
Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can.
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.
Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better.
It's important.
You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis.
Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.
Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.
It is easier than you think.
A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy.
And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis. net. There is a carbon calculator.
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral.
Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think.
Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community.
Invest sustainably.
Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.
And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions.
A lot more to be said about that.
Become a catalyst of change.
Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. 
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.
And it comes out in May. 
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.
Consider sending somebody to Nashville.
Pick well.
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean.
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.
(Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics?
It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat.
We need Republicans as well.
This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is.
Become politically active.
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it.
Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system.
Once it becomes a closed system, with U. S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation?
Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided.
The market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this.
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.
We have to change the minds of the American people.
Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.
And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. 
We have to buy a lot of those ads.
Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested.
I like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse," but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this.
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination.
(Laughter) That's really true.
I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan.
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.
This is an opportunity.
Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one.
Thank you very much, I appreciate it. (Applause)Thank you so much, Chris.
And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful.
I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night.

It was printed in Monterey, I checked.
(Laughter) And the story began, "Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" -- (Laughter) "'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.
'" (Laughter) Before I could get back to U. S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!

I update the slide show every time I give it.
I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know?
Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells.
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America.
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees.
Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I'm kidding.
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit.
Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit.
The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive.
These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.

Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that.
But it's part of the puzzle.
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks.
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.
Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do?
Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable.
Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can.
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.
Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better.
It's important.

Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.
It is easier than you think.
It really is.
A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy.
It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced.
And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis. net. There is a carbon calculator.
Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator.
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.
And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral.
Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think.
Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community.
Invest sustainably.
