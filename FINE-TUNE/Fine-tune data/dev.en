In March 2021, fierce winds blew a container ship off course.
In most places, this would have caused a minor incident.
But in the Suez Canal, it was a global crisis.
This vessel wasn’t just blocking other ships— It was obstructing the flow of international trade through one of the world’s most important waterways.
The site of the Suez Canal has been of interest to rulers of this region as far back as the second millennium BCE.
To move goods between Asia and the Mediterranean basin, traders had to traverse the narrow isthmus separating the Red Sea and the Nile, journeying in camel-bound caravans through the unforgiving desert.
A maritime passage between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea would bypass this trip altogether.
And throughout the 16th century, multiple powers attempted to construct such a canal.
But their plans were obstructed by cost, political strife, and the ever-shifting sands.
In 1798, interest in building a canal was rekindled, this time attracting attention from across Europe.
Over the following decades, individuals from Austria, Italy, Britain, and France pitched their plans to Egypt’s rulers.
At the time, Egypt was a territory of the Ottoman Empire, which was resistant to these proposals.
But Egypt's political and economic autonomy was gradually increasing, and its government was eager to pursue the project.
When Sa’id Pasha came into power in 1854, he approved a plan from the enterprising and manipulative French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps.
Signed in 1854 and 1856, a pair of concessions gave de Lesseps authority to establish the Suez Canal Company and finance it by selling shares to “capitalists of all nations.
” The contracts between Sa’id Pasha and the Canal Company also promised a workforce of hundreds of thousands of Egyptian workers.
Beginning in 1862, about 20,000 laborers were forcibly recruited every month, digging the canal in harsh desert conditions without easy access to food or water.
Diseases like cholera ran rampant and workers toiled under the threat of whips.
The estimates of those who died during construction range into the thousands.
In 1864, the new Egyptian ruler, Isma’il Pasha, put an end to the coerced Egyptian labor, but he still pressed forward with construction.
Foreign workers from all over Europe and the Middle East labored alongside dredgers and bucket excavators to remove 74 million cubic meters of dirt.
This massive population of workers required infrastructure to deliver drinking water and other supplies, giving rise to a flourishing economy of restaurants, brothels, and smuggled goods.
Amidst the bustle were born three new cities with multi-ethnic populations: Port Said on the northern Mediterranean shore, Ismailia on the canal's middle tract, and Port Tewfiq, at the southern edge of the canal.
The construction site bypassed the Nile and ran directly from Port Said to Suez.
And after years of work, the streams of the two seas finally began merging in the mid-1860s.
The finished canal was 164 kilometers long, with a width of 56 meters at the surface, and it was officially inaugurated on November 17th, 1869. While it struggled financially during its first few years, the canal ended up dramatically accelerating global trade.
It also facilitated the migration of numerous marine species, dramatically changing local ecosystems and cuisine.
Over the decades, traffic through the canal grew.
But in 1875, financial issues forced Egypt to sell much of its stock in the Canal Company, allowing Britain to take over.
It was only in 1956 that control of the canal fully reverted to Egypt when it was nationalized by President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
This move sparked a military standoff between Egypt and Britain, France, and Israel.
But once resolved, it transformed the canal into a major source of Egypt's national revenue and helped redeem the canal's imperialist legacy.
Today, nearly 30% of all global ship traffic passes through the Suez Canal, totaling over 20,000 ships in 2021. However, the incident of the Ever Given is a stark reminder of just how fragile our manmade systems can be.In March 2021, fierce winds blew a container ship off course.

The civilization of Kush was more than a thousand years old at that time.
Its early capital city at Kerma had impressive temples, palaces, and houses, including a massive mudbrick temple structure that had a chapel deep inside, reached by a long staircase at the center.
Rich gold mines helped the Kushites build a flourishing commercial network, making bronze weapons and tools and trading materials like incense, animal skins, ivory, and ebony wood from sub-Saharan Africa.
The tide started to change for Kush as Egypt descended into civil war.
By 750 BCE, Egypt was divided into local kingdoms with fluctuating alliances.
The Kushite king Piankhy saw an opportunity.
He led his navy, flanked by horsemen and archers, up the Nile to the gateway city of Khemenu.
As Piankhy’s army constructed siege ramps and battle towers, the city’s ruler sent his wives and daughters to negotiate— not with Piankhy, but with the women of his royal household, later known as kandake, who were extremely influential in military affairs and political succession.
At the end of a long siege, Piankhy entered the conquered city and bitterly criticized the conditions in its stables.
From there, Piankhy and the Kushite forces conquered the Egyptian capital of Memphis.
Piankhy installed his sister, Amunirdis, as priestess of the great god Amun, in the Egyptian city of Thebes, and left other Kushite officials there before returning to live in Kush.
His successors extended control all the way to the Nile Delta.
This was a high point for the Empire of Kush: trade thrived, and they built magnificent temples, palaces, and pyramid tombs all along the Nile.
But the Assyrian army was approaching Egypt in its annual campaigns.
When the Assyrians began to encroach on trade routes near Jerusalem, the Kushite king Taharqo moved to stop them.
The Assyrians defeated him with the help of some rebelling Egyptian princes, and drove him out of Egypt in the 7th century BCE.
The Kushites continued to rule in their homeland for nearly 1,000 years that were prosperous and innovative.
They moved their capital farther south to the city of Meroe, where they built temples to a new god called Apedemak.
They built new cities in the savannah south of the Sahara Desert, some of which contained huge reservoirs for water.
When the Roman Empire conquered Egypt in 31 BCE, Kushite armies again traveled north, led by Queen Amanirenas.
She led them to success in battle against the Romans, capturing the bronze head of a statue of the Roman emperor Augustus, and bringing it back to Kush.
They buried it under the doorway of a temple in the capital, so that worshippers would step on it as they crossed the threshold.
After brokering peace with the Romans, Kush continued to prosper.
Over time, however, groups of people called the Noba raided from the west, and trade routes were disrupted by the rising kingdom of Aksum.
Around 350 CE, the Aksumite king sacked Meroe, effectively bringing Kushite rule to an end.
Since then, some have argued that Kush’s history has been overlooked by generations of European and American scholars who promoted the idea that Egypt was part of the origin of Western civilization, while Kush, as an African culture, was excluded.
Today, there’s still much to learn about Kush— including a writing system we haven’t deciphered fully.Along the Nile River, in what is now northern Sudan, lay the ancient civilization of Kush.
Though they were once conquered by a powerful neighbor, the kings and queens of Kush would go on to successfully challenge two of the most dominant empires in history. From 1500 to 1100 BCE, Egypt controlled Kush, introducing many Egyptian cultural and religious practices.
The civilization of Kush was more than a thousand years old at that time.
They'll use that opportunity to chop it up with him, and often when they're done talking with him, they’ll mention that they think he’s a smart and engaging little guy.
One of the things that I’ve learned is that Americans have an orientation toward progress. In this context, what that means is that we often celebrate the distance between where we were and where we are now.
But that same orientation can blind us from the gap between where we are and where we could or should be.
The other thing I’ve learned about Americans is that we have a very, very narrow understanding of racism, mostly in the minds and hearts of people, usually old people -- old people from the South.
And this really narrow definition can constrain our opportunities to produce a more racially egalitarian society.
We like to hunt for races and distance ourselves from people who say mean things about whole groups of people or who idealize the 1950s. But the fact of the matter is that we might just need to look in the mirror.
Now, I'm not saying that everyone here is a racist, but what I am saying is that everyone here has the capacity and perhaps even the propensity to live their life in a way, to make decisions, to rely on biases that reproduce racial inequality.
Some people say, “Well, you do all this work about racism.
What’s the answer?
” And I say that the first thing we might need to do is to come to a shared understanding about what racism is in the first place.
History shows that racists have had the upper hand in deciding who the racists are and what racism is, and it’s never them or the things that they do.
But maybe if we come together and come to a shared and perhaps a precise definition of what racism is, we can work toward creating a society where mothers like me aren’t in constant fear of their children’s lives. 
I'd like to dispel three myths about racism on our trek toward mutual understanding. First: it’s true that the South has done its work to earn its reputation as the most racist region.
But there are other states and regions that are competing for the title.
For example, if we look at the most segregated states in terms of where Black kids go to school, we'll see, sure, some are in the South.
There are some out west, in the Midwest and in the Northeast.
They're where we live.
Or if we look at states with the biggest racial disparities in terms of prison populations, we see that none of them are in the South.
They're where we live.
My colleague Rebecca Kreitzer and I looked at a standard battery of racial attitudes of prejudice, and we found that in the 1990s, states in the South dominated the most racially negative attitudes.
But this geography has evolved, and things have changed.
By 2016, we found that the Dakotas, Nebraska, states in the Midwest, in the Northeast, were competing for the "most prejudiced population" titles.
Now, I'm not saying that one state is more racist than another, but what I am saying is that every state might have its own special brand of racism.
And it doesn't have to be like this.
Most of the inequalities that we see in our day-to-day lives happen at the state and local level.
What that means is that we don't have to go all the way to Congress to make change in our communities.
We can simply hold our city, our county, our state legislators to task to produce more equitable outcomes.
Myth two: we're not that good at hunting for racists. Remember that time when the governor of Virginia did blackface, and people were like, "Oh, that's bad.
I need to get that racist out of here"?
I was giving y'all the side-eye, and here's why.
While people were going back to yearbooks to look for things that were obviously racist, fewer people were looking into the current-day policy stances of legislators who probably did blackface but didn't get caught.
So, how many of us might have supported a candidate who is willing to let neighborhoods secede from their district so that kids could go to all-white schools -- in the 21st century?
Or how many of us might have supported a ballot measure that systematically reduced some groups' chances of voting?
Or how many of us might have focused on the behavior of Black mothers rather than doctors or health care systems and policies when we learn about the huge racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality?
It doesn't have to be like this.
We could do something different.
We could scrutinize the behaviors of the rule makers.
We could orient ourselves toward a more just society, and on our way there, we can't mystify practical policy solutions.
But we also know that they don't live diverse lives.
Research shows that the average white American literally has one black friend.
And what that means is that most don't have any at all.
Sociologists like Sarah Mayorga show that even when well-meaning white folks move to diverse neighborhoods, they don't necessarily have positive interactions, no less any with their neighbors who aren't white.
My research with Professor Christopher DeSante shows that when we ask white millennials their racial attitudes and policy preferences, that they're sometimes, just as in other times, even more racially conservative than boomers.
When we ask them about the things that are important to them, they don't have any particular sense of urgency around questions of racial inequality.
How did we get like this?
Well, one of the things we might think about is how we raise our kids and equip them to solve the problems that we want them to solve.
Research shows that white parents in particular will either choose to not talk about issues of racism to their kids in order to protect them from a harsh racial reality or they instill colorblind lessons, and that can actually reinforce negative racial attitudes.
So it's kind of like how some of your parents might have given you books about puberty so they didn't have to talk about the birds and the bees, and then you tried to connect all the dots and then you did it all wrong.
It's like that.
It doesn't have to be like this.
We can do better.
We can have hard conversations with our kids so that they don't grow up like many of us did, thinking that talking about racism makes you a racist -- it doesn't -- and so that we can prevent them from making the same mistakes that we've seen in the past.
Remember a long, long time ago in 2008, when we were all pining to live in a post-racial world?
Well, I say that it's time for us to think bigger and dream bigger and think about what it would be like to live in a post-racist world.
So we could ask harder questions of candidates about their stances on racial inequality before we throw our full weight behind them.
We could buycott or boycott businesses whose practices don't align with our values.
We could talk to our kids about racism.
We could figure out our state's special brand of racism and work to eradicate it. People made racial disparities, and people can unmake them.
And sure, it'll be hard, but the fact of the matter is, someone is depending on us to do nothing at all.
Thank you.
(Applause)When I’m out at the grocery store or maybe a restaurant or the park with my son -- he’s six and a half -- people will stop us and mention that they think that he’s handsome. I agree.
They'll use that opportunity to chop it up with him, and often when they're done talking with him, they’ll mention that they think he’s a smart and engaging little guy.
When those people walk away, the thought that comes to my mind is that I hope they remember meeting him as a child when they see him again as a grown man.
This thought comes to my mind because I’ve written two books about race and racism in the United States, and this kind of work can produce feelings of pessimism.
One of the things that I’ve learned is that Americans have an orientation toward progress. 
In this context, what that means is that we often celebrate the distance between where we were and where we are now.
But that same orientation can blind us from the gap between where we are and where we could or should be.

Myth three: If you believe that when all the grandmas in Mississippi die that racism is going to go with them, you are in for a big disappointment. 
We like to think that young people are going to do the hard work of eradicating racism, but there are some things that we should note. 
We know that young folks, young white folks especially, like diversity, they appreciate it, they're looking for it.
Sociologists like Sarah Mayorga show that even when well-meaning white folks move to diverse neighborhoods, they don't necessarily have positive interactions, no less any with their neighbors who aren't white.
It doesn't have to be like this.
If the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland melt completely, millions of people's homes will be under water.
The coldest nights in the Arctic might get 10 degrees warmer.
The warmest days in Mumbai might get five degrees hotter.
Over the past 10,000 years, we've been lucky.
Earth's climate was stable and our civilizations flourished.
But as our climate gets more unstable, so will our economies and our societies.
We'll all suffer, and the vulnerable will be hit hardest, unless we act now.
[Countdown Take action on climate change at Countdown. ted. com]Why is 1.5 degrees such a big deal?
Because to warm our entire planet up by 1.5 degrees Celsius requires a lot of heat.
All this extra heat melts glaciers, which raise sea levels.
If the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland melt completely, millions of people's homes will be under water.
The extra heat also intensifies weather, making wet places wetter, dry places drier and increasing the ferocity of storms.
That 1.5-degree increase also won't be distributed evenly.
The coldest nights in the Arctic might get 10 degrees warmer.

My dad passes away.
My mind racing, memories, flashbacks, moments, early mornings, getting up, taking grounders and throwing, speed outs and deep post routes to my brother and my dad, to early morning car rides to AAU baseball, to my dad being the third-base coach.
And however many millions and millions of people all over the world watching.
And having to walk to the media, and what do I say next, what do I do, what do I think?
Being married at a young age and just coming out of college and everything else, to, you know, shortly after, marriage not working out and realizing, you know what?
Life happens.
Life happens, life happens to all of us.
Loss of family members, divorce, fear, pain, depression, concerns, worries.
It's hard to be positive in the midst of it all.
And what I definitely knew was this: that negativity works 100 percent of the time.
Negativity was going to get me nowhere.
I started saying to myself, "New are his mercies every morning," new beginnings, new starts.
And despite hardship and pain and worries and wanting to get through it and "How do I do this?
", I started thinking about a car.
You know how when you drive a car, you've got stick shift and you want to shift to neutral?
You go from first gear to second gear, all the way to fifth?
You've got to know how to shift to neutral.
And I needed to shift to neutral immediately, before I crashed.
Sitting there after the Super Bowl, I had a decision to make: Will I let this define my career? Will I let it define my life?
Hell, no.
What I found out was this: that mindset is a skill.
It can be taught and learned.
I started 10 years ago, training my mind, with this guy named Trevor Moawad, my mental conditioning coach.
He's been with me for 10 years, and we've been best friends and partners ever since.
As athletes, we train the body, we train ourselves to be able to run fast, throw farther, jump higher and do these different things, but why don't we train our mind?
What do you want your life to look like?
Write it out, talk about it, say it.
What's our language, what does it look like, watch these highlights, Russell, when you're in your best moments.
What does that look like?
And be that, live that, sound like that.
The best free throw shooters, they don't worry about the shot they just missed.
They think about this shot, this putt, this throw, this first down.
Then I met this kid Milton Wright, 19 years old, he had cancer three different times.
This day when I went to see him, he was frustrated, "Russ, I'm done, I don't want to do this anymore, it's my time to go.
" I started telling him this story about my dad, how he used to say, "Son, why not you?
Why don't you graduate early, play pro football and pro baseball?
Why not you, why not you?
" I said, "Milton, why not you?
If you tried T-cell therapy, and you try this and it doesn't work, you won't remember it.
" So Milton got a smile on his face and said, "You're exactly right.
Yes, I do have cancer, Russ.
But I can either let this kill me, not just physically, but I can also let it kill me emotionally and mentally.
And I have a choice right now, in the midst of the problem, in the midst of the storm, to decide to overcome.
" One of the questions I always get asked about neutral thinking is this: "Does that mean I don't have any emotion?
" And I always say, absolutely not.
Yeah, we have emotions, we have real-life situations, we have things to deal with.
But what you have to be able to do is to stay focused on the moment and to not be superemotional. It's OK to have emotions, but don't be emotional.
When people look at me, they see that I'm the highest-paid player in the NFL, they see that I have the girl and Ciara, that I have the family and this and that.
But I still have real-life situations.
We all do.
We all have, you know, sadness and loss and depression and worries and fear.
I didn't just get here.
What's the truth, and how do I come through this better?
And that's really, kind of, how my mind started shifting.
It was not just on the success of it all or the failure of it, it was on the process, like: What is the next step, how do I do this right here, right now?
We have a choice to make in life.
And for me, when I was young and I didn't have much, I made a choice.
I made a choice that I was going to believe that great things were going to happen, that I was going to have my mindset right, and I was going to have the right language and the right things to think about, which helped prepare me for today.
Because I'm just human.
I just have the ability to throw the ball a long way and run around and make some cool and fun throws and make some people smile.
But the reality is that I still have pressure, I still have worries, I still have fears, I still have things that happen.
Still have loss.
Positivity can be dangerous.
But what always works is negativity.
I never wanted to live in negativity, so I stayed in neutral.
I kept my shift in neutral.
And so that's where I lived, and that's where I've been living ever since.June 8, 2010, Russell Wilson, fourth-round pick to the Colorado Rockies baseball.
I'm fired up, one of the highest moments of my life.

Positivity can be dangerous.
I like to get past the fur, the feathers and the scales.
I want to get under the skin. No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog, my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.
You may wonder, do I ever photograph people? Sure. People are always present in my photos, no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions.
You just have to learn how to look past their disguise. As a photographer, I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thing.
When I use my camera, I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are. As animals blessed with the power of rational thought, we can marvel at the intricacies of life.
As citizens of a planet in trouble, it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.
But as humans with hearts, we can all rejoice in the unity of life, and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave.
Let's find a way to join the dance.
Thank you. (Applause)
My dad's not alone.There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia, and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million.
That's a lot of people.Dementia scares us.The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia, the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us. And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things: 
We go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me. 
" Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia, and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us. I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
That's what happened with my dad. My dad was a bilingual college professor.
His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds.
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.
We should retain those people.
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people.
" But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?
What do they look like?
You might think these must be very senior teachers.
And the answer is no.
Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter.
The variation is very, very small.
You might think these are people with master's degrees.
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality.
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all, is a master's degree.
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.
One is seniority.
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
Teach for America: slight effect.
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
There are some people who are very good at this.
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it, to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?
" The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
And it's a system with very high turnover.
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
It's an unbelievable thing.
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching.
They take the poorest kids, and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools.
They're constantly improving their teachers.
" They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
How does that compare to a normal school?
And they need advanced notice to do that.
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.
Of course, digital video is cheap now.
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?
" And they could all sit and work together on those problems.
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it, have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
If you have a kid who's behind, you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet, but you could make it so that DVDs were always available, and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system, we can do it much better.
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP -- the place that this is going on -- that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice.
" And I thought it was so fantastic.
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
(Applause) Now, we put a lot of money into education, and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting -- the House version actually had money in it for these data systems, and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things.
But I -- I'm optimistic.
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is, and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.
I only had time to frame those two problems.
There's a lot more problems like that -- AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited, just at the very name of these things.
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.
So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things, get other people involved -- and you're helping to come up with solutions.
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.
Thank you.
(Applause)I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation, sharing some of the problems.
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that -- being honest about what was going well, what wasn't, and making it kind of an annual thing.
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally.
That is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things.
And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to.
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand.
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite, is to look at childhood deaths.
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of five.
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.
It's a phenomenal thing.
Each one of those lives matters a lot.
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs: vaccines that were used more widely.
For example, measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000. So we really can make changes.
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again. And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.
Why?
Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths: diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning, which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?
Well, what's the history of this disease?
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.
In fact, if we look at the genetic code, it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.
So it was absolutely gigantic.
And the disease was all over the world.
A terrible disease.
It was in the United States.
It was in Europe.
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s, when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.
So it was everywhere.
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.
And so that's why the death rate did come down.
Now, ironically, what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where the rich countries are.
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
1945, it's still most places.
1970, the U. S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries, it doesn't get much investment.
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria.
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
(Laughter) And rich men are afflicted.
And so that's why that priority has been set.
But, malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact.
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much.
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
(Laughter) There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
(Laughter) (Applause) Those mosquitos are not infected.
So we've come up with a few new things.
We've got bed nets.And bed nets are a great tool.
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night, so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.
And that's happened now in a number of countries.
But we have to be careful because malaria -- the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.
And so you end up with two choices.
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way, you do it vigorously, you can actually get a local eradication.
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.
Now we're on the upswing.
There's new drug discovery going on.
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.
And so as these elements come together, I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria.
Now let me turn to a second question, a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?
And the answer is no.
Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter.
The variation is very, very small.
You might think these are people with master's degrees.
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality.
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all, is a master's degree.
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.
One is seniority.
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
Teach for America: slight effect.
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
There are some people who are very good at this.
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it, to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?
" The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
And it's a system with very high turnover.
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
It's an unbelievable thing.
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching.
They take the poorest kids, and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools.
They're team teaching.
They're constantly improving their teachers.
They're taking data, the test scores, and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase.
" They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms, at first it's very bizarre.
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?
" The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.
What's going on?
" And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention, which kids were bored, and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.
Everybody needs to be involved.
And so KIPP is doing it.
How does that compare to a normal school?
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.
The data isn't gathered.
In the teacher's contract, it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom -- sometimes to once per year.
And they need advanced notice to do that.
" Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.
They don't have the test scores, and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.
But I'm optimistic about this, I think there are some clear things we can do.
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well, and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?
" And they could all sit and work together on those problems.
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it, have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system, we can do it much better.
" And I thought it was so fantastic.

Walking in front of him was her. The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart.
Sure, she had aged a little. In fact, she had aged a lot. But he felt all his old passion for her return.
"Ford," he called softly. For that was her name.
"Don't say another word, Gusty," she said, for that was his name. "I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here. Let's go there and make love.
In the tent.
" Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.
The earth moved for both of them. And they lived together happily ever after.
And all because he decided to walk that day.
(Applause) Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate. The moral imperative is on the table. Great creativity is needed to take it all, make it simple and sharp.
To make it connect.
To make it make people want to act.
So this is a call, a plea, to the incredibly talented TED community.
Let's get creative against climate change. And let's do it soon.
Thank you.
