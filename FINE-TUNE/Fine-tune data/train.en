In 1960, American composer John Cage went on national television to share his latest work.
But rather than employing traditional instruments, Cage appeared surrounded by household clutter, including a bathtub, ice cubes, a toy fish, a pressure cooker, a rubber duck, and several radios.
Armed with these tools and a stopwatch, he performed “Water Walk,” setting off a series of sounds with a serious expression and incredible precision.
Some viewers found the performance hysterical, while others thought it was completely absurd.
But most people watching likely shared the same question: is this even music?
This question is harder to answer than you might think.
What we determine as music often depends on our expectations.
For example, imagine you’re in a jazz club listening to the rhythmic honking of horns.
Most people would agree that this is music.
But if you were on the highway hearing the same thing, many would call it noise.
After all, car horns aren’t instruments and these drivers aren’t musicians. . . right?
Expectations like these influence how we categorize everything we hear.
We typically think something sounds more musical if it uses a recognizable structure or popular sounds arranged in well-known patterns.
And even within the realm of music, we expect certain genres to use specific instruments and harmonies.
These expectations are based on existing musical traditions, but those traditions aren't set in stone.
They vary across different cultures and time periods.
And in the early 20th century, when many artists were pushing the boundaries of their fields, John Cage wanted to discover what new kinds of music might exist beyond those constraints.
He began pioneering new instruments that blurred the lines between art and everyday life, and used surprising objects to reinvent existing instruments.
He also explored new ways for music to mingle with other art forms.
He and his creative and romantic partner, Merce Cunningham, held recitals where Cage’s music and Cunningham’s choreography would be created independently before being performed together.
But whatever his approach, Cage gleefully dared listeners to question the boundaries between music and noise, as well as sound and silence.
Perhaps the best example is one of Cage’s most famous compositions— a solo piano piece consisting of nothing but musical rests for four minutes and 33 seconds.
This wasn’t intended as a prank, but rather, as a question.
Could the opening and closing of a piano lid be music?
What about the click of a stopwatch?
The rustling, and perhaps even the complaining, of a crowd?
Like the white canvases of his painting peers, Cage asked the audience to question their expectations about what music was. And while the piece didn’t evoke the drama of some traditional compositions, it certainly elicited a strong emotional response.
Cage’s work frequently prioritized these spontaneous, ephemeral experiences over precise, predictable performances.
He even developed processes that left some compositional decisions up to chance.
One of his favorite such systems was the I Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text.
Using just a handful of coins, the I Ching allows readers to produce a pattern of lines which can be interpreted to answer questions and offer fortunes.
But Cage adapted these patterns into a series of tables that generated different musical durations, tempos, and dynamics.
Eventually, he even used early computers to help produce these random parameters.
For some pieces, Cage went even further, offering musicians incomplete compositions notated with broad instructions, allowing them to compose on the fly with the help of his guidelines.
Some composers rejected Cage's seemingly careless approach.
They believed it was the composer’s job to organize sound and time for a specific, intentional purpose.
After all, if these strange compositions were music, then where do we draw the line?
But like a bold explorer, Cage didn't want to be bound by restrictions, and he certainly didn't want to follow old rules.
He dedicated himself to shattering our expectations, creating a series of once in a lifetime experiences that continue encouraging musicians and audiences to embrace the unexpected.
Ebola is one of the deadliest viruses we know of.
If left untreated, it kills about half of those it infects.
It can spread through pretty much every fluid your body makes, including blood and sweat.
Even the dead can transmit the disease, often doing so at their own funerals.
On December 26th, 2013, a two-year-old boy in southern Guinea got sick.
Just two days later, he died.
It took local doctors working with the international community four months to discover that Ebola was to blame, largely because it had never before been detected outside of Central Africa.
In those four months, Ebola gained a head start that would prove devastating.
The outbreak lasted two years and mushroomed into the largest Ebola epidemic in recorded history.
More than 28,000 people contracted the disease and over 11,000 died.
In 2013, Guinea had no formal emergency response system, few trained contact tracers, and no rapid tests, border screenings, or licensed vaccine for Ebola.
After that epidemic, Guinea, with the support of the US and other international partners, completely overhauled their epidemic response system.
And in January 2021, that system faced its first real test.
It started when a nurse in southern Guinea developed a headache, vomiting, and fever.
A few days later, she died.
As dictated by traditional burial practices, her family prepared her body for the funeral.
Within a week, the nurse’s husband and other family members started experiencing symptoms.
Health officials suspected Ebola much quicker than in 2013 and ordered tests.
They came back positive, and Guinea activated its epidemic alert system the next day.
Then, lots of things happened very quickly.
Guinea’s National Agency for Health Security activated 38 district-level emergency operations centers, as well as a national one.
Teams of epidemiologists and contact tracers began the painstaking job of figuring out exactly who was exposed and when, generating a list of 23 initial contacts that quickly grew to over 1,100. Advanced rapid testing capacity spun up in the city where the outbreak started.
At Guinea’s borders with Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, public health workers screened more than 2 million travelers.
A large-scale vaccination campaign was started.
And, finally, more than 900 community mobilizers alerted people of the outbreak and suggested alternative burial practices that were acceptable to the community and reduced the risk of spreading Ebola.
Thanks to all these measures, the 2021 outbreak ended just four months after it began.
Only 23 people contracted Ebola; only 12 died.
That's less than 1% of the deaths in the prior outbreak.
The 2021 outbreak cost $100 million to control— which sounds like a lot but pales in comparison to the global economic cost of the previous outbreak: $53 billion.
So should every country just copy Guinea’s approach?
Not exactly.
It is always important to respond to an outbreak quickly, so an early warning system is essential.
But beyond that, a successful response can look very different for different diseases in different countries.
For example, Brazil quenched an outbreak of yellow fever, which is spread by mosquitoes, primarily by mounting a massive vaccination campaign.
That strategy worked well for Brazil because it’s one of the major global producers of the yellow fever vaccine, and its population was accustomed to regular, routine vaccinations.
But for many diseases, you don't even need a mass vaccination program.
In August of 2021, a truck driver tested positive for cholera in Burkina Faso.
Health care workers alerted the government that same day and contact tracing began immediately.
Cholera is caused by a bacterium, so Burkina Faso gave antibiotics to those exposed or potentially exposed.
This extremely fast response stopped the outbreak just a few weeks after it started.
Cholera often rears its head in West Africa— in 2021, there were over 100,000 cases and more than 3,700 deaths.
Because Burkina Faso was so well prepared, they had zero deaths that year. Zero. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, health officials piloted a community-owned, community-driven outbreak alert system to monitor animal health— that’s important because some animal outbreaks have the potential to spill over and become human outbreaks.
Villagers used an app to alert health authorities about outbreaks in animals.
Over the course of 16 months, 36 animal outbreaks were identified.
For any outbreak response system to be effective, it needs to be trusted, valued, and ultimately used by communities.
That means reaching people where they are, in the language they speak, and aware of the culture, beliefs, and practices with which they live.
Perhaps most importantly, we can't expect to do nothing for years and then just swing into action when an outbreak occurs.
One of the best ways to save lives is to invest in lasting health infrastructure, 365 days a year, for everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us.Ebola is one of the deadliest viruses we know of.

As your morning alarm blares, you mutter to yourself, “Why did I set it so early?
” While brushing your teeth, you think, “I need a haircut. . . unless?
” Rushing out the front door, you reach for your keys and realize they’re not there.
Frustrated you shout, “I can’t do anything right!
” just in time to notice your neighbor.
Being caught talking to yourself can feel embarrassing, and some people even stigmatize this behavior as a sign of mental instability.
But decades of psychology research show that talking to yourself is completely normal.
In fact, most, if not all, of us engage in some form of self-talk every single day.
So why do we talk to ourselves?
And does what we say matter?
Self-talk refers to the narration inside your head, sometimes called inner speech.
It differs from mental imagery or recalling facts and figures.
Specifically, psychologists define self-talk as verbalized thoughts directed toward yourself or some facet of your life.
This includes personal conversations like “I need to work on my free throw.
” But it also includes reflections you have throughout the day, like “The gym is crowded tonight.
I’ll come back tomorrow.
” And while most self-talk in adults tends to be silent, speaking to yourself out loud also falls into this category.
In fact, psychologists believe our first experiences with self-talk are mostly vocal, as children often speak to themselves out loud as they play.
In the 1930s, Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky hypothesized that this kind of speech was actually key to development.
By repeating conversations they’ve had with adults, children practice managing their behaviors and emotions on their own.
Then, as they grow older, this outward self-talk tends to become internalized, morphing into a private inner dialogue.
We know this internal self-talk is important, and can help you plan, work through difficult situations, and even motivate you throughout the day.
But studying self-talk can be difficult.
It relies on study subjects clearly tracking a behavior that’s spontaneous and often done without conscious control.
For this reason, scientists are still working to answer basic questions, like, why do some people self-talk more than others?
What areas of the brain are activated during self-talk?
And how does this activation differ from normal conversation?
One thing we know for certain, however, is that what you say in these conversations can have real impacts on your attitude and performance.
Engaging in self-talk that’s instructional or motivational has been shown to increase focus, boost self-esteem, and help tackle everyday tasks.
For example, one study of collegiate tennis players found that incorporating instructional self-talk into practice increased their concentration and accuracy.
And just as chatting to a friend can help decrease stress, speaking directly to yourself may also help you regulate your emotions.
Distanced self-talk is when you talk to yourself, as if in conversation with another person.
So, rather than “I’m going to crush this exam,” you might think, “Caleb, you are prepared for this test!
” One study found that this kind of self-talk was especially beneficial for reducing stress when engaging in anxiety-inducing tasks, such as meeting new people or public speaking.
But where positive self-talk can help you, negative self-talk can harm you.
Most people are critical of themselves occasionally, but when this behavior gets too frequent or excessively negative, it can become toxic.
High levels of negative self-talk are often predictive of anxiety in children and adults.
And those who constantly blame themselves for their problems and ruminate on those situations typically experience more intense feelings of depression.
Today, there’s a field of psychological treatment called cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, which is partially focused on regulating the tone of self-talk.
Cognitive behavioral therapists often teach strategies to identify cycles of negative thoughts and replace them with neutral or more compassionate reflections.
Over time, these tools can improve one's mental health.
So the next time you find yourself chatting with yourself, remember to be kind.

It’s April 10th, 1815, and in just a few moments, the sun is going to disappear.
On an island in present-day Indonesia, Mount Tambora erupts with a boom that can be heard over 2,000 kilometers away.
Sulfurous plumes of steam and ash billow thousands of meters into the sky, forming dark storm clouds of soot and lightning. This eruption will go down as the largest in recorded history, but, at this point, its impact is only just beginning.
The hazy skies and cold weather of 1816 wreak havoc on agriculture, leading to famines all across the Northern Hemisphere.
Nations struggle with epidemics, and artists craft bleak tributes to these seemingly apocalyptic times.
This was the year without summer— literally one of the darkest periods in human history.
So why are some modern researchers looking for ways to repeat it?
Obviously, no one wants to replicate this period’s famine and despair.
But some scientists are interested in using sulfurous haze to block out the sun, and hopefully, slow the effects of global warming.
This is one of many proposals in the realm of geoengineering— a class of deliberate, large-scale interventions in Earth’s natural systems intended to help restrain climate change.
Different geoengineering schemes intervene in different systems.
Any plans to cool the planet by blocking the amount of sunlight reaching the earth would fall in the category of solar radiation management.
Some of these proposals are massive in scale, such as suggestions to create a helpful version of volcanic plumes or build a giant sunshade in Earth’s orbit.
Others are more limited, focusing on enhancing natural cooling systems.
For example, researchers might enlarge marine clouds or make Earth reflect more sunlight by building huge swaths of white surfaces. Many of these plans sound more than a little strange.
But there’s reason to believe they might work, not least because of natural events like the eruption of Tambora.
Scientists know that volcanic eruptions have periodically cooled the climate.
Both the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 and 1883′s blast of Krakatoa reduced global average temperatures by at least half-a-degree Celsius for up to a year.
These cooling effects are global and fast acting— but they're also incredibly risky.
The Earth is a chaotic system where even the smallest changes can create countless unpredictable ripple effects.
We know that cooling temperatures impacts precipitation, extreme weather, and other climate phenomena, but it’s difficult for even the most advanced computer models to predict how or where these consequences will occur.
One country’s solar radiation management might be another country’s unnatural disaster, causing extreme weather or crop failures like those following Tambora’s eruption.
And even if these schemes did safely cool the planet, solar radiation management doesn’t address the greenhouse gases that are causing global warming.
These solutions are just highly experimental band-aids that the world would have to endure for at least a few decades while we work on actually removing CO2 from the air.
And if we pulled that band-aid off prematurely, global temperatures could rapidly rebound, causing a period of intense super warming.
For these reasons and more solar radiation management is risky.
Today, researchers are running small-scale experiments, such as enhancing marine clouds to protect the Great Barrier Reef from further heating and bleaching.
And most scientists agree that we should pursue ways to cut emissions and remove atmospheric CO2 first and foremost.
However, there are reasons to keep studying these more aggressive approaches.
Desperate times call for desperate measures, and in the future, geoengineering might be civilization’s last resort.
Furthermore, some of these plans would be shockingly easy to execute by some rogue actor with enough cash. So we’ll want to be prepared if someone starts geoengineering without governmental approval.
But perhaps the most important reason to investigate the impacts of geoengineering is that people are already making large scale interventions in the atmosphere.
In many ways, climate change is an unintended geoengineering project fueled by the emissions generated from centuries of burning fossil fuels.
And unless we take action to curb emissions and draw CO2 out of the atmosphere soon, summer may never be the same again.It’s April 10th, 1815, and in just a few moments, the sun is going to disappear.

For almost two millennia, the Pope has been a figure of supreme spiritual authority for Catholics around the world.
But in the late 14th century, Catholics found themselves with not one, not two, but three popes.
Where did this plethora of popes come from?
And who among them was the genuine article?
The origins of this papal predicament began in 1296, when France’s King Philip IV decided to raise taxes on the Church.
Given the clergy’s political power, this offended Pope Boniface VIII, leading him to write the “Unam Sanctam”: a radical decree asserting the Pope’s total supremacy over earthly rulers.
But King Philip struck back.
He declared Boniface a heretic and tried to have him arrested in a violent raid.
Boniface survived the assault, but died soon after.
And following a short-lived successor, Pope Clement V was elected in 1305. A French diplomat seeking peace in the war between England and his homeland, Clement wanted to stay close to the conflict and escape the demands of Rome.
So in 1309, he moved the seat of the papacy to Avignon— a city close to France but owned by a vassal of the Church.
The papacy remained here for the terms of seven popes until the reigning Pope finally returned to Italy in 1376. But just several months after his arrival, he suddenly died.
This shocking development meant a new pope had to be elected immediately— and in Rome, where there hadn’t been a papal election in over 70 years.
The Romans were determined to elect one of their own and restore Rome as the seat of Western Christendom.
Local officials pressured cardinals to choose an Italian pope, while rowdy mobs raided the conclave and plundered the papal wine cellar.
Amidst this chaos, the cardinals elected the Neapolitan Archbishop of Bari to become Pope Urban VI.
Initially, Urban was seen as a safe choice.
But he quickly proved to be a reformer who sought to limit the cardinal’s finances.
Desperate to maintain their luxurious lifestyles, the cardinals declared the recent election illegitimate, since it was decided under pressure from the Roman mob.
They denounced Urban as a usurper and held a new conclave to elect Pope Clement VII.
Clement attempted to excommunicate Urban, but he refused to recognize the authority of Clement or his greedy cardinals.
Urban named new cardinals to his court and entrenched himself in Rome while Clement and his supporters returned to Avignon.
The schism had officially begun.
Western Christendom now had two capitals, Avignon and Rome, each with their own Pope and court of cardinals.
As popes from each line died, their cardinals appointed successors, continuing the crisis for decades.
This strange situation didn't impact most ordinary Catholics, as there were no significant doctrinal splits.
Instead, the drama played out in the diplomatic realm.
European rulers were forced to choose sides, as both popes vied for spiritual and political supremacy.
Only a pope had the authority to call a general council to officially resolve the issue, and both sides refused to take this step.
So in 1409, a group of cardinals from France and Rome took matters into their own hands.
They claimed that since both popes were disputed, cardinals did have the right to call a council.
And at their gathering these cardinals deposed the pretenders and elected a new Pope.
Unfortunately, both Avignon’s Pope and Rome’s Pope refused to recognize this council.
So instead of solving the crisis, the number of popes rose to three.
This unusual arrangement lasted five more years, until the Council of Constance in 1417. Here, the popes from the Roman line and recently created third line resigned and agreed to unite the church under a new Pope— Martin V.
Undisputed, Martin swiftly excommunicated the only person still against him— the Pope of Avignon— and finally ended the schism after 39 years.
Today, the church’s official records say the Roman Line was always the true papal power.
But regardless of how the schism ended, its existence proves that even those who are supposed to be pious are prone to petty power struggles.For almost two millennia, the Pope has been a figure of supreme spiritual authority for Catholics around the world.
But in the late 14th century, Catholics found themselves with not one, not two, but three popes.

Local officials pressured cardinals to choose an Italian pope, while rowdy mobs raided the conclave and plundered the papal wine cellar.
Amidst this chaos, the cardinals elected the Neapolitan Archbishop of Bari to become Pope Urban VI.
Initially, Urban was seen as a safe choice.
But he quickly proved to be a reformer who sought to limit the cardinal’s finances.
Desperate to maintain their luxurious lifestyles, the cardinals declared the recent election illegitimate, since it was decided under pressure from the Roman mob.
They denounced Urban as a usurper and held a new conclave to elect Pope Clement VII.
Clement attempted to excommunicate Urban, but he refused to recognize the authority of Clement or his greedy cardinals.
Urban named new cardinals to his court and entrenched himself in Rome while Clement and his supporters returned to Avignon.
The schism had officially begun.
Western Christendom now had two capitals, Avignon and Rome, each with their own Pope and court of cardinals.
As popes from each line died, their cardinals appointed successors, continuing the crisis for decades.
This strange situation didn't impact most ordinary Catholics, as there were no significant doctrinal splits.
Instead, the drama played out in the diplomatic realm.
European rulers were forced to choose sides, as both popes vied for spiritual and political supremacy.
Only a pope had the authority to call a general council to officially resolve the issue, and both sides refused to take this step.
So in 1409, a group of cardinals from France and Rome took matters into their own hands.
They claimed that since both popes were disputed, cardinals did have the right to call a council.
And at their gathering these cardinals deposed the pretenders and elected a new Pope.
Unfortunately, both Avignon’s Pope and Rome’s Pope refused to recognize this council.
So instead of solving the crisis, the number of popes rose to three.
This unusual arrangement lasted five more years, until the Council of Constance in 1417. Here, the popes from the Roman line and recently created third line resigned and agreed to unite the church under a new Pope— Martin V.
Undisputed, Martin swiftly excommunicated the only person still against him— the Pope of Avignon— and finally ended the schism after 39 years.
Today, the church’s official records say the Roman Line was always the true papal power.
But regardless of how the schism ended, its existence proves that even those who are supposed to be pious are prone to petty power struggles.

It’s 1526 in what is now Northern India, and Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi is about to face off against a prince from Central Asia, Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur.
To quash the threat, the Sultan brings his war elephants to battle.
But it’s said that the explosions of Babur’s cannons and muskets startled the elephants and they trampled the Sultan’s own army.
Babur had long harbored ambitions of building his own empire.
Though he was descended from some of the world’s most successful conquerors, he struggled to gain a foothold among the many ambitious princes in Central Asia.
So he turned his attention to India, where his descendants stayed and built the Mughal Empire, one of the wealthiest and most powerful states in the early modern world and home to nearly a quarter of the global population.
Babur died just four years after that fateful battle, but his own memoirs and the work of his descendants immortalized him in colorful fashion.
His daughter, Gulbadan, recalled in her own memoir how Babur— having recently given up drinking— filled a newly-constructed pool with lemonade rather than wine.
His grandson, Akbar, commissioned exquisite miniature paintings of Babur’s stories— one depicted the empire’s founder riding through his camp, drunkenly slumped over his horse.
It was Akbar who consolidated Mughal power.
He established protections for peasants— which in turn increased their productivity and generated more tax revenue— and embarked on military campaigns to expand Mughal territory.
Princes who swore allegiance to him were rewarded, while he made brutal examples of those who resisted, killing them and many of their subjects.
His conquests opened access to port cities on the Indian Ocean, which connected the Mughals to Arab, Chinese, Ottoman, and European traders, bringing in incalculable wealth, including silver and new crops from the Americas.
As the Muslim ruler of a diverse, multiethnic empire, Akbar worked to create internal cohesion by appointing members of the Hindu majority to high positions in his government, marrying a Hindu bride, and distributing translated copies of the “Mahabharata,” an ancient Indian epic poem, to his Muslim nobles.
Akbar also hosted lively religious debates where Sunni and Shia Muslims, Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians, and the newly arrived Portuguese Jesuit missionaries defended the merits of their respective faiths.
While most participants viewed this as an intellectual exercise, Portuguese missionaries were disappointed by their failure to convert Akbar.
The Mughals built architectural masterpieces such as the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort, a palace three kilometers around, that housed 50,000 people and contained the magnificent gold and jewel-encrusted Peacock Throne.
Just the throne took seven years to construct.
During its first 180 years, the Mughals had only six rulers, which contributed to the empire’s stability.
When the fourth emperor, Jahangir, struggled with alcohol and opioid addiction, his wife, Nur Jahan, took the reins as co-ruler.
When a traitorous general captured her husband in an attempted coup, she negotiated his release and rallied the army to stop the rebellion.
She once led a hunting party to track down a tiger that was terrorizing a village, leading one poet to write: “Though Nur Jahan be in form of a woman/ In the ranks of men she’s a tiger-slayer.
” Following the death of the sixth emperor, Aurangzeb, in 1707, seven emperors took the throne over the next 21 years.
These frequent transitions of power reflected the larger political, economic, social, and environmental crises that plagued the empire throughout the 18th century.
In response to this turmoil, regional leaders started refusing to pay taxes and broke away from Mughal control.
The British East India Company offered military support to these regional rulers, which in turn increased the company's political influence, enabling it to eventually take direct control of Bengal, one of the wealthiest regions in India.
By the 19th century, the East India Company had massive political influence and a large standing army, which included Indian troops.
When these troops revolted in 1857, aiming to force out the British and restore Mughal influence, the British government intervened, replacing company rule with direct colonial rule, deposing the last Mughal emperor and sending him into exile.
And so, over three centuries after its founding, the Mughal Empire came to an end.It’s 1526 in what is now Northern India, and Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi is about to face off against a prince from Central Asia, Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur.

All these ancient skulls have perfectly straight teeth, despite almost certainly never sporting braces.
And this isn't some strange sample.
According to the fossil record, ancient humans usually had straight teeth, complete with third molars— or wisdom teeth.
In fact, the dental dilemmas that fuel the demand for braces and wisdom teeth extractions today appear to be recent developments.
So what happened?
While it’s nearly impossible to know for sure, scientists have a hypothesis.
A couple million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans lived a subsistence lifestyle.
Their teeth and jaws had to work hard to make the food they ate digestible.
Indeed, the surfaces of many of their teeth show extensive wear and flattening.
They also had larger jaws and teeth overall.
At some point, they began using tools and fire to cook and prepare food, which helped break it down.
A lot more time passed and, around 12,000 years ago, some humans started farming and domesticating animals and plants.
Over the course of several thousand years, it became more common for people to process and refine their food.
Milling technologies helped remove the tougher parts of grains, like the germ and bran from rice and wheat.
Fast forward to the industrial Revolution, and technological innovations dramatically accelerated these processes.
In a relatively short time, many human mouths were relieved of a great deal of their grinding, crushing, and pulverizing duties.
And interestingly, it was around this time that tooth crookedness appears to have become more common.
Examining fossils spanning millions of years of evolution, researchers have observed a gradual decrease in tooth and jaw size in humans and our ancestors.
Many think that, for most of human history, dietary shifts— like the introduction of meat and the advent of cooking— were gradual, and that changes in tooth and jaw size basically kept pace with one another.
But with the more recent revolutions in agricultural and culinary habits, that relationship changed.
As the theory goes, over a relatively short period, some human populations saw a decrease in jawbone size, while teeth stayed roughly the same size, meaning they're left vying for limited space.
When they do grow in, they may displace others and get jostled into some eccentric positions.
And then wisdom teeth, which are usually the last to make their debut, seem to only complicate things further.
In many cases, they have little or no space to emerge.
This can lead to impacted wisdom teeth, which may cause discomfort and infections if not surgically removed.
So larger jaws appear to be associated with greater chewing demands.
And many scientists think that as people's diets have become less chewy, their jaws have gotten smaller— and that this has led to dental crowding, resulting in dental crookedness and impacted wisdom teeth.
This hypothesis has been supported by some preliminary experimental data.
In a 1983 study, researchers raised 43 squirrel monkeys on diets of either naturally tough or artificially soft food.
Those fed softer food had more crowded premolars, rotated or displaced teeth, and narrower dental arches.
And a 2004 study similarly observed that hyraxes raised on cooked foods experienced roughly 10% less growth in facial areas involved in chewing compared to those given raw and dried foods.
In other words, the issue at large seems to be environmental— or one of lifestyle— instead of a genetic one, though heritable factors may be at play in some instances.
It’s estimated that somewhere between 30 to 60% of people today experience some level of tooth crowding.
But this trend varies across global populations.
Some people naturally never have wisdom teeth.
And some don’t experience tooth crowding or crookedness and still get their wisdom teeth without a hitch.
This seems to coincide with diets that are less processed.
So how can we prevent tooth crowding early, using lifestyle changes and orthodontics?
Well, it’s certainly something to chew over.All these ancient skulls have perfectly straight teeth, despite almost certainly never sporting braces.

In 2009, five Kenyan people took a petition to the British Prime Minister’s office.
They claimed they endured human rights abuses in the 1950s, while Kenya was under British colonial rule and demanded reparations.
They had vivid accounts and physical scars from their experiences— but their testimonies were undermined.
They had no documentary evidence that Britain sanctioned systems of torture against Kenyans— at least, not yet.
Thousands of secret files were waiting to be discovered.
In 2010, a historian joined the trial as an expert witness and attested to having seen references to missing documents.
They noted that Kenya had repeatedly requested the return of stolen papers, which the British government had refused.
In fact, many historians suspected there were gaps in the archives.
As a result, the court ordered the release of any relevant documents.
And, days later, British officials acknowledged that 1,500 pertinent files were being held in a high-security archive.
It soon became clear that these were just a small sample of documents Britain hid between the 1950s and 70s, while former colonies declared independence, as part of a widespread colonial British policy called Operation Legacy.
The policy was for British colonial officers to destroy or remove documentation that might incriminate Britain and be of strategic value to the new governments.
They were instructed to destroy, alter, or secretly transport these papers to the UK.
Documents slated for destruction were to be burnt to ashes or sunk in weighted crates far from shore.
During the trial, between 2010 and 2013, an independent historian revealed they had located more than 20,000 previously hidden Operation Legacy files from 37 former colonies.
Finally, an estimated 1.2 million colonial files, sprawling kilometers in the archive’s so-called “Special Collections,” were also exposed.
And these were only the documents that British forces kept.
How many were destroyed— and what information they contained— remains unknown.
About 3.5 tons of colonial documents were slated for incineration in Kenya.
Ultimately, Operation Legacy’s objective was to obscure critical aspects of the truth.
In the words of Britain’s attorney-general in Kenya, “If we are going to sin, we must sin quietly.
” So, what really happened in Kenya?
Beginning in 1895, the British administration forcibly removed people from their traditional lands, giving the most fertile areas to European settlers to establish large-scale farms.
They mandated forced labor systems, implemented reservations for Indigenous African peoples, and restricted their movement.
Kenyan people resisted these incursions from the start and grew increasingly organized over time.
One movement, the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, aimed to forcibly remove white settlers and overthrow the colonial government.
When the British declared a state of emergency in 1952, they were giving themselves permission to take otherwise illegal special measures to regain control.
The newly revealed Operation Legacy documents confirmed that people suspected of participating in the resistance were subjected to horrible abuses.
Between 1952 and 1959, the British imprisoned over 80,000 people without trial, sentenced over 1,000 people convicted as terrorists to death, and imposed extreme surveillance and interrogation tactics.
Some people were beaten to death.
Others were raped or castrated.
Many were shackled at the wrist for years.
Children were killed.
One person was burnt alive.
Ndiku Mutwiwa Mutua testified to being castrated while handcuffed and blindfolded.
Wambugu Wa Nyingi said he was suspended upside-down, beaten, and had water thrown on his face until he could barely breathe.
Jane Muthoni Mara said she was sexually violated with a hot bottle, and imprisoned for years without cause.
In response to the new evidence, the British government issued a formal apology, and made an out-of-court financial settlement with the 5,228 Kenyan claimants ultimately involved in the case.
The original five claimants had made history— and paved the way for it to be rightfully rewritten.
The uncovered files challenge fundamental myths about British colonialism as a benevolent institution that brought freedom and democracy to its subjects, then graciously gave them independence.

For thousands of years, native Takhi horses roamed the steppes of Central Asia.
But by the late 1960s, they’d become extinct in the wild— the last herds struggling in meager habitats against hunters and competition from local livestock.
Some small groups of Takhi survived in European zoos, but their extinction still seemed inevitable.
To prevent this terrible fate, a coalition of scientists and zoos pulled together to start an international Takhi breeding program.
By the 1990s, these collaborators in Europe and the US began releasing new generations of Asia’s ancient wild horse back into their native habitat.
This Takhi revival was a world-famous conservation victory, but the full story is much more complicated than it first appears.
And its twists and turns raise serious questions about the role of zoos and what conservation even means.
They concluded the species was a sort of missing link between wild asses and modern horses.
And as reports of the newly dubbed Przhevalsky’s horse circulated through Europe and America, zoo proprietors became eager to acquire the previously unknown species.
At this time, zoos were focused primarily on drawing visitors with exotic animals, and their exhibitions were more concerned with entertainment than animal welfare.
But in the early 1900s, the near extinction of the American bison and the total extinction of other species like the passenger pigeon inspired zoos to rebrand as centers for conservation.
And as it became clear that Przhevalsky’s horse might be headed for a similar fate, zoos began breeding programs to sustain the captive population.
However, the individuals behind these programs came to an interesting conclusion about how the horses should be bred.
Like their colleagues, they believed the species represented a missing link between modern domestic horses and their more primitive ancestors.
They also knew that some of the horses in their collections weren’t purebred Takhi, and many didn’t even resemble the species’ standard description. So breeders felt it was up to them to determine what a wild Takhi should look like, and breed them accordingly.
Basing their work on just a few specimens and broad beliefs about what a primitive horse might look like, they created a rigorous model for the ideal Takhi.
And over the 20th century, breeders in western zoos and private collections created a population of thousands of horses all carefully bred to share the same physical characteristics.
Of course, in their native habitat, wild Takhi had regularly interbred with domesticated horses for millennia, producing a population with much more diverse appearances.
So when it was time to introduce the Takhi to their ancestral home, they were quite different from the horses who’d been taken from those steppes a century earlier.
Complicating things even further, while these new Takhi herds were no longer in zoos, to this day, almost all remain closely monitored and controlled for their own protection.
So in a strange way, it’s hard to say if these animals are actually in the wild or even if they’re truly Takhi.
The story of the Takhi horse is not unique.
In many of our conservation victories, it’s difficult to say exactly what was saved, and the role that zoos play in conservation can be very complicated.
It's clear that zoos have been and can continue to be significant forces for animal preservation, especially efforts to save charismatic animals from extinction.
But today, the most direct cause of animal extinctions are humanity’s impacts on animal habitats and Earth’s climate.
So if zoos truly want to help protect the diversity of animal life on this planet, perhaps they should redirect their efforts to preserving the natural habitats these animals so desperately need.For thousands of years, native Takhi horses roamed the steppes of Central Asia.
But by the late 1960s, they’d become extinct in the wild— the last herds struggling in meager habitats against hunters and competition from local livestock.
Some small groups of Takhi survived in European zoos, but their extinction still seemed inevitable.
To prevent this terrible fate, a coalition of scientists and zoos pulled together to start an international Takhi breeding program.
By the 1990s, these collaborators in Europe and the US began releasing new generations of Asia’s ancient wild horse back into their native habitat.
This Takhi revival was a world-famous conservation victory, but the full story is much more complicated than it first appears.
And its twists and turns raise serious questions about the role of zoos and what conservation even means.
They concluded the species was a sort of missing link between wild asses and modern horses.
And as reports of the newly dubbed Przhevalsky’s horse circulated through Europe and America, zoo proprietors became eager to acquire the previously unknown species.
At this time, zoos were focused primarily on drawing visitors with exotic animals, and their exhibitions were more concerned with entertainment than animal welfare.
But in the early 1900s, the near extinction of the American bison and the total extinction of other species like the passenger pigeon inspired zoos to rebrand as centers for conservation.
And as it became clear that Przhevalsky’s horse might be headed for a similar fate, zoos began breeding programs to sustain the captive population.
However, the individuals behind these programs came to an interesting conclusion about how the horses should be bred.
Like their colleagues, they believed the species represented a missing link between modern domestic horses and their more primitive ancestors.
They also knew that some of the horses in their collections weren’t purebred Takhi, and many didn’t even resemble the species’ standard description. So breeders felt it was up to them to determine what a wild Takhi should look like, and breed them accordingly.

In the 1980s, the world faced a huge problem: there was a rapidly expanding hole in the ozone layer.
So, what happened?
And is it still there?
Let’s go back to the beginning.
The Sun makes life on Earth possible, but too much exposure to its UV radiation damages plant and animal DNA.
Thankfully, about 98% of that radiation is absorbed by ozone molecules dispersed in the stratosphere, which are continuously broken apart and reformed in this process, maintaining a delicate equilibrium.
But in the early 1970s, two chemists— Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland— demonstrated that widely used chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, could upset this balance.
CFCs were developed in the 1920s by three US-based corporations as coolants for refrigerators.
Unlike existing alternatives— such as ammonia or methyl chloride— CFCs were non-flammable and non-toxic— meaning they wouldn't burst into flames or cause deadly gas leaks.
They also made great propellants, foaming agents, and fire-retardants.
CFCs soon found their way into a variety of everyday items and became a multi-billion dollar per year industry.
In the lower atmosphere, CFCs don’t break down or react with other molecules.
But Molina and Rowland showed that in the stratosphere, they're broken apart by UV light, releasing chlorine atoms.
These then react with ozone, destroying it faster than it can be replenished.
A single chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules before finally reacting with something else and forming a stable molecule.
Seeing the threat to their bottom line, CFC producers pushed back to discredit the scientists, even accusing them of working for the KGB.
Initial estimates showed that within 60 years, CFCs could reduce ozone concentrations by 7%.
But by 1985, it became clear that ozone depletion, especially over Antarctica, was happening much faster.
Here, the extremely cold temperatures and unique structure of Antarctic clouds accelerated ozone loss.
Scientists stationed in Antarctica noticed a massive drop in overhead ozone occurring every spring.
Satellite data revealed the vast extent of these losses and chemical tests confirmed that the cause was unquestionably CFCs.
NASA soon released visualizations, which were broadcast around the world and captured public attention.
If ozone depletion continued, rates of skin cancer would skyrocket.
Photosynthesis would be impaired, making plants— including rice, wheat, and corn— less productive and more susceptible to disease.
Global agricultural production would plummet, and entire ecosystems would collapse.
But many politicians— weighing immediate economic concerns over long-term ones— disagreed about what to do.
The fight to ban CFCs found two unlikely allies in US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Despite their general opposition to government regulation, Reagan, who had undergone treatment for skin cancer, and Thatcher, who was trained as a chemist, recognized the need for immediate action.
The US and UK, along with Canada, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, led calls for an international ban on CFCs.
In 1987, representatives signed the Montreal Protocol, requiring the rapid phasing out of CFCs and creating a fund to assist Global South countries in obtaining affordable, non-ozone depleting alternatives.
It was later ratified by every country on Earth— the only treaty in history to achieve this.
In 1995, Molina, Rowland, and their Dutch colleague Paul Crutzen, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
As the use of CFCs declined, the ozone hole began shrinking, and is predicted to disappear entirely by 2070. But we’re not out of the woods yet.
While the ban was a win for the climate, as CFCs are potent greenhouse gases, the alternatives that replaced them— hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs— are too.
While generally less potent than CFCs, HFCs still trap more heat than carbon dioxide and are contributing to climate change.
To address this, in 2016, the Kigali Amendment was added to the Montreal Protocol, calling for an 85% cut in global HFCs by 2047. This alone could avoid up to 0.5°C of global warming by the end of the century.
Today, as we face the existential threat of climate change, the Montreal Protocol serves as a model for the decisive global cooperation we need to combat it.
The question is, what will it take for us to come together again?
(Rhythmic drumming) Welcome to Africa.
We are a continent that is rich in diversity.
We have diverse resources.
In Botswana, you can find diamonds.
In DR Congo, there’s cobalt.
And in Ghana, you find gold.
And then there's the food.
Africans have found countless ways to prepare rice, from the jollof in the west to the pilau in the east.
But for me, our most fascinating diversity is our dance.
I am passionate about African dance because I'm a dancer and I'm African.
But I also believe that dance is important, and through it we can learn so much about our history and where we come from.
If the African culture was a tree, then I think dance would be its flowers.
If you look at the African dance of today, you find that its core foundation is traditional dance, and these are dances that were created with a specific purpose, for a ceremony or a celebration.
It could be for war, for coming of age or even to bring rain.
But what's really interesting with traditional dance is that through it you can almost paint this visual map of migration.
And so through the movement of a dance, you can trace the movement of people.
And so even though Africa is the most diverse continent in the world, we're also much more connected than we think.
Let's take the Zulu Kingdom.
In the 1800s, the Zulus were mighty warriors, ruled by a fierce and brutal king known as Shaka Zulu.
A wave of Zulu people proceeded outward into the eastern and central region of Africa, where they became known by new names, like the Ngoni and the Ndebele of Zimbabwe.
Three dances from these regions are known as indlamu, isitshikitsha and ngoma.
These dances are essentially cousins.
They come from their own families, but when you look at them, you see the power of Shaka Zulu's Kingdom.
[Ndebele isitshkitsha dance] [Ngoni ngoma dance] [Zulu indlamu dance] In the DRC, we find the Luba ethnic group, and they have a traditional dance called mutuashi.
This dance was used to celebrate fertility and visually, it's liberation of a woman's waist.
But a mutuashi dancer, someone performing a traditional dance, could cause a lot of controversy to those who had adopted a more conservative mindset from the West.
In Zambia, we find the Bemba ethnic group who are descendants of the Luba people, and so they share similar dances.
One of the Bemba dances is called infunkutu, and it’s normally seen at a lady’s pre-marriage ceremony.
Just like the Luba people, this dance is a celebration of a woman.
[Baluba mutuashi dance] (Drumming and singing) [Bemba infunkutu dance] If we move into the eastern part of Africa, we find a showcase of the shoulders.
The eskista from Ethiopia supposedly imitates the shaking of a rattlesnake, and it closely resembles two other dances from its neighboring countries: the quda in Eritrea and the kamabeka from Kenya.
These dances are performed to different rhythms, but their core movement remains the same.
[Bukusu kamabeka dance] (Music) [Ethiopia eskista dance] [Tigrinya quda dance] It wasn’t only migration that separated ethnic groups but also the artificial borders that were drawn by some guys from overseas.
In Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria, there were once no border distinctions and no movement restrictions.
The Ewe people can be found in each of these countries, and they perform a dance called the togo atsia, which is danced to the togo atsia drum pattern.
Although these people were separated, their dance shows an endurance of their cultural connections.
[Togo atsia dance] (Rhythmic drumming) Nelson Mandela once said, "The curious beauty of African music is that it uplifts even as it tells a sad tale.
" And I find this to be just as true with dance.
It's restored our hope in times of struggle.
In South Africa during apartheid, gold miners were not allowed to speak while they worked, so they used their boots to create rhythmic beats of communication, a dance known as the gumboot dance.
And then there is zouglou.
In the '90s in Cote d'Ivoire, university students facing economic hardship danced by raising their arms into the air as if making a plea.
So we dance to celebrate what we have overcome.
And so we find that a dance is not just a movement, but that movement embodies feeling and expression because it carries history and stories.
Today, our modern African dance is a fusion of styles that have come from different traditional dances that continues to celebrate and appreciate our cultural heritage.
Have a look.
(Electronic dance music) [Sangra dance] [Legwork dance] [Network dance] [Zanku dance] [Ndombolo dance] Thank you for sharing African dance with me today.
He learned the hundreds of distinct winds that wafted and whipped around his homeland.
Chanting their names, he could stir the skies and raise the waves.
Like his father before him, he became the most trusted attendant to King Keawenuia’umi of Hawaii Island.
But his privileged status also made him a target.
Two of the king's seafaring navigators were especially envious.
They knew Paka’a’s skills and responsibility to the king were divinely inherited, but they coveted his position.
So they whispered rumors and eventually turned the king against his most loyal companion.
Paka’a watched bitterly as he was stripped of his land and privileges.
He fled, escaping the navigators who plotted to drown him as he sailed away, and took refuge on Molokaʻi, where he married a young chiefess.
They brought a son into the world, but Paka’a never stopped imagining his return.
He taught his son, Kuapaka’a, the way of the winds until Kuapaka’a was poised to avenge his father and restore his rightful place beside the king.
Back on Hawaii Island, as the two navigators revealed their selfishness, the king realized how easily he’d been deceived and longed for Paka’a.
Some of his more trustworthy attendants divined that Paka’a was still alive and told the king to construct canoes for a journey.
However, Paka’a could not return so easily.
First, the king’s loyalty and dedication had to be tested.
As the king rallied his attendants, Paka’a’s ancestral spirits arrived in the form of two birds and rotted the trees he was using for canoe-building.
Though exhausted, the king had his best archers shoot the birds, and he started again.
Later, as Paka’a dreamed, the king’s spirit announced his search.
However, Paka’a’s own spirit misled the king, saying he was on Ka’ula— not Molokaʻi.
The king’s fleet soon set sail.
As they passed Molokaʻi, Paka’a’s son, Kuapaka’a, greeted them, warning that a storm was brewing.
He chanted the names of the winds, but kept his identity a secret, as per Paka’a’s plan.
The king’s navigators dismissed the young boy’s claims.
But as they sailed off, Kuapaka’a unleashed a vicious storm and all were forced to shelter on Molokaʻi.
For four months, Kuapaka’a maintained the storm.
With Paka’a’s secret supervision, he earned the king’s trust, and, after clearing the sky, Kuapaka’a agreed to join the king’s search.
At sea, the two navigators continuously discredited Kuapaka’a.
Finally, he readied himself for revenge and called the winds.
As waves crashed, Kuapaka’a anchored the canoe and passed provisions to everyone— except the two navigators.
They grew cold and weak, eventually falling overboard.
But Kuapaka’a’s work wasn’t done.
While everyone slept, he brightened the sky and sailed towards Hawaii Island instead of Ka’ula.
Though the king regretted not finding Paka’a, everyone was glad to be home and forgot about Kuapaka’a— until the day he proposed a canoe race.
He wagered his catch of flying fish against that of eight fishermen who had been appointed by the two treacherous navigators.
They agreed, figuring it'd be an easy win.
But Kuapaka’a called to La’amaomao, and a great wave whisked him ahead of his opponents.
Enraged and convinced this was a fluke, the fishermen asked for a rematch.
But this time, they demanded Kuapaka’a wager his bones against theirs.
But the time had come for Kuapaka’a to reveal his identity and have the King prove his commitment to Paka’a.
At last, the king and Paka’a were back at each other’s sides. Wielding the sacred wind gourd, Paka’a and Kuapaka’a ensured the names of the winds would never be lost, and those who understood them never undermined or forgotten.
In fact, some animals only ever undergo parthenogenesis, while others can reproduce both sexually and parthenogenetically.
More than 80 different sexual vertebrate species— including Komodo dragons and certain kinds of turkeys, pythons, and sharks— have surprised us by occasionally reproducing this way.
The theory predicts that parthenogenetic lineages will accumulate harmful mutations over time and eventually, after thousands of generations, will reach a point of so-called mutational meltdown.
But scientists have observed an accumulation of harmful mutations in parthenogenetic stick insects that are absent in their sexual relatives.
Only time will tell whether this will cause their extinction.
Otherwise, some parthenogenetic species appear to have ways of circumventing a mutational meltdown.
New Mexico whiptail lizards came about when two different lizard species hybridized, creating this new all-female species.
As hybrids, their genome is a combination of the different sets of chromosomes from their two parent species.
This gives them a high level of genetic diversity, which may allow them to survive long into the future.
Bdelloid rotifers, meanwhile, have been reproducing parthenogenetically for 60 million years.
They might have managed this by taking in foreign genetic material.
Indeed, about 10% of their genes comes from other organisms, like fungi, bacteria, and algae.
How exactly they do this is unclear, but whatever the trick is, it seems to be working.
To totally untangle the mysteries of reproduction, we’ll need more research— and probably a few more surprises like Ispera.
What's the most important century in human history?
Some might argue it’s a period of extensive military campaigning, like Alexander the Great’s in the 300s BCE, which reshaped political and cultural borders.
Others might cite the emergence of a major religion, such as Islam in the 7th century, which codified and spread values across such borders.
Or perhaps it’s the Industrial Revolution of the 1700s that transformed global commerce and redefined humanity's relationship with labor.
Whatever the answer, it seems like any century vying for that top spot is at a moment of great change— when the actions of our ancestors shifted humanity’s trajectory for centuries to come.
So if this is our metric, is it possible that right now— this century— is the most important one yet?
The 21st century has already proven to be a period of rapid technological growth.
Phones and computers have accelerated the pace of life.
And we’re likely on the cusp of developing new transformative technologies, like advanced artificial intelligence, that could entirely change the way people live.
Meanwhile, many technologies we already have contribute to humanity’s unprecedented levels of existential risk— that’s the risk of our species going extinct or experiencing some kind of disaster that permanently limits humanity’s ability to grow and thrive.
The invention of the atomic bomb marked a major rise in existential risk, and since then we’ve only increased the odds against us.
It’s profoundly difficult to estimate the odds of an existential collapse occurring this century.
Very rough guesses put the risk of existential catastrophe due to nuclear winter and climate change at around 0.1%, with the odds of a pandemic causing the same kind of collapse at a frightening 3%.
Given that any of these disasters could mean the end of life as we know it, these aren’t exactly small figures, And it’s possible this century could see the rise of new technologies that introduce more existential risks.
AI experts have a wide range of estimates regarding when artificial general intelligence will emerge, but according to some surveys, many believe it could happen this century.
Currently, we have relatively narrow forms of artificial intelligence, which are designed to do specific tasks like play chess or recognize faces.
Even narrow AIs that do creative work are limited to their singular specialty.
But artificial general intelligences, or AGIs, would be able to adapt to and perform any number of tasks, quickly outpacing their human counterparts.
There are a huge variety of guesses about what AGI could look like, and what it would mean for humanity to share the Earth with another sentient entity.
AGIs might help us achieve our goals, they might regard us as inconsequential, or, they might see us as an obstacle to swiftly remove.
So in terms of existential risk, it's imperative the values of this new technology align with our own.
This is an incredibly difficult philosophical and engineering challenge that will require a lot of delicate, thoughtful work.
Yet, even if we succeed, AGI could still lead to another complicated outcome.
Let’s imagine an AGI emerges with deep respect for human life and a desire to solve all humanity’s troubles.
History has taught us that no matter how enlightened a civilization thinks they are, they are rarely up to the moral standards of later generations.
So maybe we should all live like the future depends on us— because actually, it just might.
As the morning sun shines on the Golden Gate Palace, brother and sister Hisham and Asma prepare for the journey of a lifetime.
They intend to travel with the big hajj caravan that is protected by the caliph soldiers.
As a woman, a life of formal scholarship is not available to her.
Hisham heads toward the library complex to ask the scholars’ advice.
A Persian poet wants to share his latest poetry, but Hisham doesn’t see how that will get him the camel for tonight, so he kindly refuses.
As he says goodbye, they give him the names of important theology scholars to visit in Medina, on the way to Mecca.
But to get there, he’ll need a camel.
Meanwhile, Asma visits an older, married cousin.
An enslaved girl opens the door, and takes Asma to the women’s quarters, where men cannot enter.
Her cousin wants to hear Asma’s latest poetry, but Asma tells her she’s in a hurry and explains their predicament.
She’s in luck— her cousin’s husband has a camel to offer them.
With their arrangements secure at last, they make their final preparations.
At the designated times for men and women, each performs a ritual ablution at one of Baghdad’s many public bathhouses.
As the sun sets, the city’s criers announce the caravan’s departure, and the townspeople flock to watch the pilgrims leave.
In the spring of 1979, a lab worker in Sverdlovsk, USSR removed a clogged air filter in the ventilation system and didn’t replace it.
His note to the supervisor was never transferred to the official logbook, so when the next shift rolled in, workers simply started production as usual.
Now, in most labs, this would have been a minor mistake.
But this lab was a biological weapons facility producing huge quantities of anthrax— which, if inhaled, can kill up to 90% of those it infects.
This deadly anthrax powder floated out into the sky for hours, causing the largest documented outbreak of inhalation anthrax on record and resulting in at least 64 deaths.
What happened at Sverdlovsk was a tragedy, and the Soviet bioweapons program was a violation of international law.
But these days, it’s not just state-sponsored bioweapons programs that keep biosecurity experts up at night.
Nor is anthrax their largest concern.
They’re worried about an even more dangerous kind of lab leak.
Since the 1970s, researchers have been manipulating the DNA of microbes to give them abilities they didn’t have before.
This is called “gain of function” work and it includes a huge body of scientific research.
The majority of this work helps humanity with very little risk, for example, engineered viruses are used in vaccine production, gene therapy, and cancer treatments.
But within the gain of function realm lies an intensely debated sub-field where scientists engineer superbugs.
Officially known as “enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” these ePPPs are typically variants of well-known viruses, such as Ebola or avian influenza that have been engineered to be, say, more transmissible or more deadly.
The stakes of this kind of work are much higher: if even one unusually dangerous virus escaped a lab, it could cause a global pandemic.
Virologists developing ePPPs argue this research could help us prepare for future pandemics, allowing us to jump start treatments and potentially save lives.
For example, in the early 2010s, several research teams created a deadly strain of bird flu with the novel ability to spread through the air between mammals.
Advocates of the project argued that by creating this ePPP, we could learn crucial information about a worst-case-scenario virus under controlled conditions.
But many critics argued that it’s unclear whether bird flu would ever evolve in the wild as it did in the lab.
Consequently, they believed the knowledge gained by studying this dangerous virus wasn’t remotely worth the risk of creating it in the first place.
Both sides of this ongoing debate are trying to save lives; they just disagree on the best way to do it.
However, everyone agrees that an ePPP lab leak could be catastrophic.
Labs that work with dangerous pathogens are designed with numerous safety features to protect the scientists who work there, as well as the outside world, such as ventilation systems that decontaminate air and airtight “spacesuits” with dedicated oxygen.
Sometimes buildings are even nested inside each other to prevent natural disasters from breaching the closed environment.
But this technology is expensive to build and maintain.
And even when our tech doesn't fail, there’s still room for the most common kind of mistake: human error.
Many human errors are inconsequential: a researcher spills a sample, but quickly disinfects the otherwise well-controlled environment.
In 2014, six vials containing the virus that causes smallpox were found in an unsecured storage room where they’d been forgotten for decades.
That same year, a CDC scientist unknowingly contaminated a sample of relatively harmless bird flu with a deadly lab-grown variant, and then shipped the contaminated sample to the USDA.
While these incidents did not lead to larger crises, the potentially catastrophic consequences of an ePPP leak have convinced many scientists that we should stop this kind of research altogether.
But if that doesn’t happen, what can we do to minimize risk?
Well, first, we can work to reduce human error by examining past mistakes.
Some experts have suggested creating an international database of leaks, near-misses, and fixes taken that would help labs adapt their protocols to minimize human errors.
And a robust, well-funded pandemic early warning system would help protect us from any disease outbreak— whether it comes from a lab leak or a natural spillover.
Developing the kind of global standards and databases necessary for these changes would be difficult— requiring unprecedented international collaboration and transparency.
But we need to overcome these hurdles because pandemics don't care about borders or politics.
Medieval Europe.
Where unbathed, sword-wielding knights ate rotten meat, thought the Earth was flat, defended chastity-belt wearing maidens, and tortured their foes with grisly gadgets. Except. . . this is more fiction than fact.
So, where do all the myths about the Middle Ages come from?
And what were they actually like?
The “Middle Ages” refers to a 1,000-year timespan, stretching from the fall of Rome in the 5th century to the Italian renaissance in the 15th.
Though it’s been applied to other parts of the world, the term traditionally refers specifically to Europe.
One misconception is that medieval people were all ignorant and uneducated.
For example, a 19th century biography of Christopher Columbus incorrectly purported that medieval Europeans thought the Earth was flat.
Sure, many medieval scholars describe the Earth as the center of the universe— but there wasn't much debate as to its shape.
A popular 13th century text was literally called “On the Sphere of the World.
” And literacy rates gradually increased during the Middle Ages alongside the establishment of monasteries, convents and universities.
Ancient knowledge was also not “lost”; Greek and Roman texts continued to be studied.
The idea that medieval people ate rotten meat and used spices to cover the taste was popularized in the 1930s by a British book.
It misinterpreted one medieval recipe and used the existence of laws barring the sale of putrid meat as evidence it was regularly consumed.
In fact, medieval Europeans avoided rancid foods and had methods for safely preserving meats, like curing them with salt.
Spices were popular.
But they were oftentimes pricier than meat itself.
So if someone could afford them, they could also buy unspoiled food.
Meanwhile, the 19th century French historian Jules Michelet referred to the Middle Ages as “a thousand years without a bath.
” But even small towns boasted well-used public bathhouses.
People lathered up with soaps made of things like animal fat, ash, and scented herbs.
And they used mouthwash, teeth-scrubbing cloths with pastes and powders, and spices and herbs for fresh-smelling breath.
So, how about medieval torture devices?
In the 1890s, a collection of allegedly “terrible relics of a semi-barbarous age” went on tour.
Among them: the Iron Maiden, which fascinated viewers with its spiked doors— but it was fabricated, possibly just decades before.
And there’s no indication Iron Maidens actually existed in the Middle Ages.
The “Pear of Anguish,” meanwhile, did exist— but probably later on and it couldn’t have been used for torture.
Medieval legal proceedings were overall less gruesome than these gadgets suggest.
They included fines, imprisonment, public humiliation, and certain forms of corporal punishment.
Torture and executions did happen, but especially violent punishments, like drawing and quartering, were generally reserved for crimes like high treason.
Surely chastity belts were real, though, right?
Probably not.
They were first mentioned by a 15th century German engineer, likely in jest, alongside fart jokes and a device for invisibility.
From there, they became popular subjects of satire that were later mistaken for medieval reality.
Ideas about the Middle Ages have varied depending on the interest of those in later times.
The term— along with the pejorative “Dark Ages”— was popularized during the 15th and 16th centuries by scholars biased toward the Classical and Modern periods that came before and after.
And, as Enlightenment thinkers celebrated their dedication to reason, they depicted medieval people as superstitious and irrational.
In the 19th century, some Romantic European nationalist thinkers— well— romanticized the Middle Ages.
They described isolated, white, Christian societies, emphasizing narratives of chivalry and wonder.
But knights played minimal roles in medieval warfare.
And the Middle Ages saw large-scale interactions.
Ideas flowed into Europe along Byzantine, Muslim, and Mongol trade routes.
And merchants, intellectuals, and diplomats of diverse origins visited medieval European cities.
The biggest myth may be that the millennium of the Middle Ages amounts to one distinct, cohesive period of European history at all.
Originally defined less by what they were than what they weren’t, the Middle Ages became a ground for dueling ideas— fueling more fantasy than fact.
Africa is perhaps the continent that needs least convincing about the clean energy opportunity for health, livelihoods and economy.
Even in West Africa, where renewable shares tend to be lower, countries like Ghana generate over a third of their power from renewable energy resources.
So if the need is urgent and if the resources are bountiful, then why are we still so far away from this clean energy future for Africa?
I've led the design and deployment of energy projects here myself.
And I found and what I've learned is that though the world loves to remind Africa about its vast clean energy potential, the financial flows to deliver that potential remain troublingly scarce.
Projects and businesses incur a number of hidden compounding costs and premiums. Like the risk perception premium. Or the “paying back your US dollar loan in a constantly depreciating local currency” premium.
Or the “expected to deliver conventionally high rates of return while raising your revenues from customers that earn less than a dollar a day” premium. So international finance markets are not appetized and financial flows here remain a trickle despite a pipeline of ready projects.
Effectively, this prioritizes risk to capital over risk to human life. In fact, though, 17 percent of the global population and almost 90 percent of those still without access to basic energy, today, Africa accounts for a mere two percent of global clean energy finance.
If local enterprise had access to long-term, low-cost financing, like their counterparts in other regions of the world can simply take for granted, then Africa's clean energy future would build itself.
We know this because African communities, by their actions, show us the kinds of futures that they want.
As our cushioned conferences wax on year after year, my friend Jeffrey runs a solar company that targets commercial and industrial customers, helping to kick-start what has become the fastest growing wave of solar across the continent.
And also demonstrating that African businesses see value in being powered by renewables. My neighborhood buddy, Samir, runs a solar irrigation company.
And at the World Resources Institute, we support dozens of young Rwandan, Ugandan and Kenyan electric mobility start-ups that are revolutionizing the face of transit in East Africa.
Africa is speaking.
(Cheers and applause)
In the early 20th century, a meteorologist named Alfred Wegener noticed striking similarities between the coasts of Africa and South America.
These observations led him to propose a controversial new theory: perhaps these and many other continents had once been connected in a single, gigantic landmass.
Wegener’s Theory of Continental Drift directly contradicted the popular opinion that Earth’s continents had remained steady for millennia, and it took almost 50 years for his advocates to convince the larger scientific community.
These plates only move at rates of around 2.5 to 10 centimeters per year, but those incremental movements shape the planet's surface.
So to determine when a new supercontinent will emerge, we need to predict where these plates are headed. One approach here is to look at how they’ve moved in the past.
Geologists can trace the position of continents over time by measuring changes in Earth’s magnetic field.
When molten rock cools, its magnetic minerals are “frozen” at a specific point in time.
So by calculating the direction and intensity of a given rock’s magnetic field, we can discover the latitude at which it was located at the time of cooling.
But this approach has serious limitations.
For one thing, a rock’s magnetic field doesn’t tell us the plate’s longitude, and the latitude measurement could be either north or south.
Worse still, this magnetic data gets erased when the rock is reheated, like during continental collisions or volcanic activity.
So geologists need to employ other methods to reconstruct the continents’ positions.
Dating local fossils and comparing them to the global fossil record can help identifying previously connected regions.
The same is true of cracks and other deformations in the Earth's crust, which can sometimes be traced across plates.
Using these tools, scientists have pieced together a relatively reliable history of plate movements, and their research revealed a pattern spanning hundreds of millions of years.
What’s now known as the Wilson Cycle predicts how continents diverge and reassemble.
And it currently predicts the next supercontinent will form 50 to 250 million years from now.
We don’t have much certainty on what that landmass will look like.
It could be a new Pangea that emerges from the closing of the Atlantic.
Or it might result from the formation of a new Pan-Asian ocean.
But while its shape and size remain a mystery, we do know these changes will impact much more than our national borders.
In the past, colliding plates have caused major environmental upheavals.
When the Rodinia supercontinent broke up circa 750 million years ago, it left large landmasses vulnerable to weathering.
This newly exposed rock absorbed more carbon dioxide from rainfall, eventually removing so much atmospheric CO2 that the planet was plunged into a period called Snowball Earth.
Over time, volcanic activity released enough CO2 to melt this ice, but that process took another 4 to 6 million years.
This influx of greenhouse gases would rapidly heat the planet, possibly triggering a mass extinction.
The sheer scale of these cracks would make them almost impossible to plug, and even if we could, the resulting pressure would just create new ruptures.
Fortunately, we have at least 50 million years to come up with a solution here, and we might already be onto something.
In Iceland, recently conducted trials were able to store carbon in basalt, rapidly transforming these gases into stone.
So it’s possible a global network of pipes could redirect vented gases into basalt outcrops, mitigating some of our emissions now and protecting our supercontinental future.
Imagine that your life began roughly 300,000 years ago as one of the planet’s first humans. At this time, you live in Africa near modern-day Morocco, and your life isn’t too different from that of your hominid parents.
You make crude tools, hunt, and gather food and materials, until, eventually, you perish.
But this is only the beginning. Because after dying, you travel back in time to be reincarnated as the second human ever to live.
While you don't remember your former life, your previous actions affect you nonetheless.
And after dying once more, you return as the third person, then the fourth, the fifth, and so on— living the lives of every single human that’s ever walked the Earth.
Strung end to end, these lives last almost 4 trillion years. Since you only recall the life you’re currently living, your psyche doesn’t carry the entire weight of human history.
However, each of your lifetimes still has a profound impact on your future selves.
Sometimes your influence on the world is obvious, but these major historical figures only account for a tiny fraction of your experience.
Instead, your existence consists mostly of ordinary lives, filled with everyday tasks like eating, laughing, working, and worrying.
For approximately one tenth of your 4 trillion years, you’re a hunter-gatherer.
For 60%, you’re an agriculturalist, developing tools and techniques which you employ over roughly 800 billion years of working on farms.
Across your lifetimes, you spend 1.5 billion years having sex and another 250 million years giving birth.
In total, 20% of your existence is spent raising children, to whom you impart a variety of cultural values that influence the trajectory of generations.
In some lives, you shatter those cultures through invasion and imperialism.
In others, you suffer as your lands and loved ones are taken away.
In over 1% of lives, you’re afflicted with malaria or smallpox, while, in others, you treat these conditions— saving countless versions of yourself.
In humanity’s early days, the average lifespan is fairly short.
There are fewer lives to live, and your influence is usually limited to people physically near you.
But as humans survive longer on average and Earth's population grows, you start to spend more time reliving the same action-packed years.
A full third of your existence comes after 1200 CE, and a quarter of it takes place after 1750. At this point, technology and society start changing faster than ever.
You invent steam engines, configure factories, and generate electricity, which power the daily machinery of all of your later lives.
You live through revolutions in science, the deadliest wars in history, and dramatic environmental destruction.
On average, each new life lasts longer, but the pace of your existence keeps accelerating.
Conversations that previously took months to unfold now happen in minutes.
Business ventures that you built over generations transform overnight.
You enjoy luxuries you never could have sampled before, even in your past lives as kings and queens.
After living over 100 billion lives, you're finally reborn as the youngest person alive today. But despite living through 300,000 years of human history, your actions have more impact today than 99% of your past lives.
High-speed air travel allows you to carry contagions and cures across an ocean in hours.
And the internet makes your personal sphere of influence global, allowing you to collaborate with anyone, anywhere, without even leaving your home.
In recent lives, you’ve invented tools to rewrite the genes of living organisms, permanently altering their future generations.
And in this life, you might create even more technologies that make the world safer, kinder, and more equitable for countless future lives.
However, one careless invention could just as easily be catastrophic.
Between nuclear weapons, lab leaks, climate change, and other existential threats, humanity's risk of inducing our own extinction has never been higher.
In this fast-paced, interconnected world, it’s frighteningly easy to undo all of humanity’s progress, or potentially, cut short all your possible futures.
There's no way to know what will happen next.
But what’s clear is that your potential is limitless.
So, how will you spend this life?

In 1998, a Maryland school district removed one of American literature’s most acclaimed works from its curriculum.
Parents pushing for the ban said the book was both “sexually explicit” and “anti-white.
” Following an outcry from other parents and teachers, the decision was eventually reversed.
But this was neither the first nor the last attack on Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings.
” Few books have been challenged more often than Angelou's memoir.
And while book banning decisions typically aren’t made at the state or national level, most of the schools and libraries that have banned Angelou’s book have given similar reasons.
Most commonly, they argue that the memoir’s account of sexual assault and the violence of US racism are inappropriate for young readers.
But these concerns miss the point of Angelou’s story, which uses these very themes to explore the danger of censorship and silence in the lives of young people.
Published in 1969, “I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings” traces the author’s childhood growing up poor, Black and female in the southern US.
Central to the narrative is Angelou’s experience of being sexually assaulted when she was seven and a half years old.
Surrounded by adults who consider the subject too taboo to discuss, Angelou decides that she is to blame.
And when she finally identifies her abuser in court, he is killed by vigilantes.
Angelou believes her voice is responsible for his death, and for six years, she stops speaking almost entirely.
The book chronicles Angelou’s journey to rediscover her voice, all while exploring the pain and misplaced shame that emerges from avoiding uncomfortable realities.
The memoir’s narrative voice expertly blends her childhood confusion with her adult understanding, offering the reader insights Angelou was deprived of as a child.
She connects her early experiences of being silenced and shamed to the experience of being poor and Black in the segregated United States.
“The Black female,” she writes, “is caught in the tripartite crossfire of masculine prejudice, white illogical hate, and Black lack of power.
” Her autobiography was one of the first books to speak openly about child sexual abuse, and especially groundbreaking to do so from the perspective of the abused child.
For centuries, Black women writers had been limited by stereotypes characterizing them as hypersexual.
Afraid of reinforcing these stereotypes, few were willing to write about their sexuality at all.
But Angelou refused to be constrained.
She publicly explored her most personal experience, without apology or shame.
This spirit of defiance charges her writing with a sense of hope that combats the memoir’s often traumatic subject matter.
When recalling how a fellow student defied instructions not to sing the Black National Anthem in the presence of white guests, she writes, “The tears that slipped down many faces were not wiped away in shame.
We were on top again. . . We survived.
” Angelou’s memoir was published amidst the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, when activists were calling for school curricula that reflected the diversity of experiences in the US.
But almost as soon as the book appeared in schools, it was challenged.
Campaigns to control lesson plans surged across America in the 1970s and 80s.
On the American Library Association’s list of most frequently banned or challenged books, “I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings” remained near the top for two decades.
But parents, students, and educators have consistently fought back in support of the memoir.
And by 2013, it had become the second most taught non-fiction text in US high school English classes.
When asked how she felt about writing one of the most banned books, Angelou said, “I find that people who want my book banned have never read a paragraph of my writing, but have heard that I write about a rape.
They act as if their children are not faced with the same threats.
And that’s terrible.
” She believed that children who are old enough to be the victims of sexual abuse and racism are old enough to read about these subjects.

You and your friend need to ace Friday’s exam to avoid summer classes, and after a week of studying, you both feel confident that you pulled it off.
But when you get your grades back, they’re much lower than the two of you expected.
You’re devastated.
However, your friend doesn't seem too bothered, and it's making you wonder why you can't shake this off like they can.
But should you really be trying to look on the bright side?
And is controlling our emotions even possible in the first place?
The answer to the last question is a definitive “yes.
” There are numerous strategies for regulating our emotions, and one framework to understand these techniques is called the Process Model.
Psychologists use this tool to identify where and how to intervene in the process that forms our emotions.
That process has four steps: first, we enter a situation, real or imagined, and that draws our attention.
Then we evaluate, or appraise, the situation and whether it helps or hinders our goals.
Finally, this appraisal leads to a set of changes in how we feel, think, and behave, known as an emotional response.
Each step of this process offers an opportunity to consciously intervene and change our emotions, and the Process Model outlines what strategies we might try at each phase.
To see this in action, let’s imagine you’ve been invited to the same party as your least-favorite ex and their new partner.
Your first strategy could be avoiding the situation altogether by skipping the party.
But if you do attend, you could also try modifying the situation by choosing not to interact with your ex.
If that’s proving difficult, you might want to shift your attention, maybe by playing a game with your friends rather than focusing on your ex’s new partner.
Another option would be to re-evaluate how you think about the situation.
After seriously reappraising things, you might realize that you don’t care who your ex dates.
If none of these strategies work, you can always try tempering your emotional response after the fact.
But this can be tricky.
More sustainable strategies here include going for a long walk, taking slow, deep breaths, or talking with someone in your support system.
Place all 99 stones correctly and the final platform must be the keystone’s correct resting place.
With perfect knowledge, we could label the stones 1 to 100, based on the order we plan to place them, and label the platforms they belong on in the same way.
There are three possibilities: one, that first stone was placed randomly onto its own platform, in which case, you’re guaranteed to succeed.
And here we reach the same three possibilities: pedestal 1, you win, pedestal 100, you lose, any other, you continue the process.
That’s all that determines whether you succeed or fail, and critically, the chances of those events are equal.
This can be unintuitive, so let’s imagine another, similar game.
Say Drumbledrore magically generates numbers from 1 to 100. If it’s a 1, you win.
If it’s 100, you lose.
If it’s anything else, he picks again.
Since the odds of winning by getting 1 are the same as losing by getting a 100, this is a game you’re just as likely to win as to lose.
It might take a while, but the delays don’t give an advantage to getting a 1 before 100, or vice versa.
The same essential reasoning applies to our situation.
You’re debating whether it’s worth risking a 50/50 chance of a cave-in when Drumbledrore reveals his secret weapon: a rare felush felucious potion, which grants extraordinary luck for a brief period of time.
There’s a 1 in 100 chance the keystone’s platform was taken by the first stone and you’ve lost already, but otherwise, you’ve got even odds to win or lose.
And right now, you’re feeling lucky.
While we often talk about puberty’s effect on the body, what gets overlooked are the fascinating changes that happen in the brain.
I’ve been sent here to talk to you about puberty.
Any questions?
During puberty, your reproductive organs grow and mature.
Any questions?
This ripening allows you to become a sexually mature adult.
There are so many other changes to your body that puberty can seem almost magical.
I think I'll take it from here.
Puberty, in fact, begins in the brain.
At some point, usually between the ages of 9 and 14, puberty is triggered when a region known as the hypothalamus releases waves of a specialized hormone.
As convenient as it would be to go to sleep a child and wake up an adult, this maturation is slow, and puberty lasts as long as 4 to 5 years.
And during this extended process, the brain undergoes its own transformation, thanks to two of puberty’s key players— estrogen and testosterone.
Produced in the developing testes and ovaries, these hormones hitch a ride to the brain via the bloodstream.
Once there, they interact with receptors on neurons, changing the way the individual cells work and function by making them more or less excitable, altering their growth, or reshaping their connections.
Cumulatively, this can change how you feel, think, and behave.
For example, hormones remodel and develop the limbic system, a collection of brain regions responsible for emotional behavior.
Research in animal models suggests that the amygdala undergoes changes in size and connectivity during puberty.
The amygdala’s function is wide-ranging, from detecting threats in your environment, to helping you recognize emotions in your friend’s faces.
Its development allows you to better connect with your peers, while priming your brain for learning and discovery.
Likewise, puberty organizes and restructures the nucleus accumbens involved in reward and sensation-seeking.
Activity in this dopamine hub is thought to drive the pleasurable sensations we feel when doing rewarding activities, like spending time with friends or having new experiences.
Several studies have found that as hormone levels increase through puberty, so does the response of the nucleus accumbens.
As a result, exploration and social engagement may feel that much more important during adolescence.
As these emotion and reward centers rapidly develop, their connections with higher cortical brain regions tend to do so on an extended timeline.
So while all these physical and mental changes can make you feel as if puberty is in control, you have more power than you think.
Everything!
The VTA is the reward-processing and motivation hub of the brain, firing when you do things like eat a sweet treat, quench your thirst, or in more extreme cases, take drugs of abuse.
Further, oxytocin can inhibit the release of stress hormones, which is why spending time with a loved one can feel so relaxing.
As early love's suspension of judgment fades, it can be replaced by a more honest understanding and deeper connection.
Alternatively, as your rose-colored glasses begin to lose their tint, problems in your relationship may become more evident.
No matter the reason a relationship ends, we can blame the pain that accompanies heartbreak on the brain.
The distress of a breakup activates the insular cortex, a region that processes pain— both physical, like spraining your ankle, as well as social, like the feelings of rejection.
As days pass, you may find yourself once again daydreaming about or craving contact with your lost partner.
The drive to reach out may feel overwhelming, like an extreme hunger or thirst.
When looking at photos of a former partner, heartbroken individuals again show increased activity in the VTA, the motivation and reward center that drove feelings of longing during the initial stages of the relationship.
This emotional whirlwind also likely activates your body’s alarm system, the stress axis, leaving you feeling shaken and restless.
As time goes on, higher cortical regions which oversee reasoning and impulse control, can pump the brakes on this distress and craving signaling.
Given that these regions are still maturing and making connections through adolescence, it's no wonder that first heartbreak can feel particularly agonizing.
Activities like exercise, spending time with friends, or even listening to your favorite song can tame this heartbreak stress response, while also triggering the release of feel good neurotransmitter dopamine.
And given time and the support, most can heal and learn from even the most devastating heartbreak.
In the coming years, artificial intelligence is probably going to change your life, and likely the entire world.
But people have a hard time agreeing on exactly how.
The following are excerpts from a World Economic Forum interview where renowned computer science professor and AI expert Stuart Russell helps separate the sense from the nonsense.
There’s a big difference between asking a human to do something and giving that as the objective to an AI system.
When you ask a human to get you a cup of coffee, you don’t mean this should be their life’s mission, and nothing else in the universe matters. Even if they have to kill everybody else in Starbucks to get you the coffee before it closes— they should do that.
No, that’s not what you mean.
All the other things that we mutually care about, they should factor into your behavior as well.
And the problem with the way we build AI systems now is we give them a fixed objective.
The algorithms require us to specify everything in the objective.
And if you say, can we fix the acidification of the oceans?
Yeah, you could have a catalytic reaction that does that extremely efficiently, but it consumes a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere, which would apparently cause us to die fairly slowly and unpleasantly over the course of several hours.
So, how do we avoid this problem?
You might say, okay, well, just be more careful about specifying the objective— don’t forget the atmospheric oxygen.
And then, of course, some side effect of the reaction in the ocean poisons all the fish.
Okay, well I meant don’t kill the fish either.
And then, well, what about the seaweed?
Don’t do anything that’s going to cause all the seaweed to die.
And on and on and on.
And it’s a perfectly normal thing for a person to do. To ask, I’m going to repaint your house— is it okay if I take off the drainpipes and then put them back?
We don't think of this as a terribly sophisticated capability, but AI systems don’t have it because the way we build them now, they have to know the full objective.
If we build systems that know that they don’t know what the objective is, then they start to exhibit these behaviors, like asking permission before getting rid of all the oxygen in the atmosphere.
In all these senses, control over the AI system comes from the machine’s uncertainty about what the true objective is.
And I think we see the same thing in humans.
How do things change?
Amazingly, Aristotle actually has a passage where he says, look, if we had fully automated weaving machines and plectrums that could pluck the lyre and produce music without any humans, then we wouldn’t need any workers.
They think, yeah, of course, if the machine does the work, then I'm going to be unemployed.
But, at the same time, would you make a robot that is accurate enough to be able to pick pretty much any object within a very wide variety of objects that you can buy?
There's an interesting story that E. M. Forster wrote, where everyone is entirely machine dependent.
You can see “WALL-E” actually as a modern version, where everyone is enfeebled and infantilized by the machine, and that hasn’t been possible up to now.
My TED Talk is finished. (Laughter and applause) Of course, I'm just kidding. But in a way that is true. Why?
What we call the essence of meditation is awareness. And what is awareness?
I'm meditating, keep quiet. (Laughter) So the more, when you try to stop thinking what happens, you will think more. So we will do a small experiment, OK?
Now, please don't think about pizza. (Laughter) No pizza. No pizza. What happened?
Did you think about pizza or not?
Kind of new ego emerged within me. I thought, oh, I have to watch out, this so. Then I decided to do something very special, what we call wandering retreat. Meaning you leave everything behind, go on the street with nothing.
Just be awareness itself.I did that practice.Then what happened?My body become decayed, I cannot see, I cannot hear. But my mind becomes so present, beyond free. And I was in that state for a few hours. Luckily, I didn't die, I come back.
This round structure is only about ten billionths of a meter in diameter, but it— as well as other technologies in the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental public health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you against everything.
We’ll get back to the grand vision later, but first, let’s start with something that’s being developed now: a vaccine that would protect you against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet.
Here’s one flu virus particle.
On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots of hemagglutinin proteins.
Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, starting the infection.
Hemagglutinin is also one of the things your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most.
To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.
Croissant!
If you show Napoleon to an immune system and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly focus on his head.
Think of it as making plaster molds of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies.
The antibodies float around your bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade.
Here’s the thing, though.
Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating.
Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes in the virus’ RNA: like this or this.
Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s head can change enough that our antibodies become less good at recognizing it.
This is called antigenic drift.
Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get a new flu shot every year.
But sometimes bigger changes happen.
An animal, usually a pig, can get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu.
And those different viruses might infect the same cell.
If that happens, the two different viral genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways.
The human flu virus could pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before.
This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's head are going to help you.
Antigenically shifted viruses have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics.
A truly universal flu vaccine would be able to protect against current flu strains and future drifted or shifted strains.
But how do we design a vaccine against a strain that doesn’t exist yet?
We look to the past.
There are key parts of hemagglutinin that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be promising targets for universal vaccines.
But there's a problem that's hindered classical vaccine production.
Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system to react to the neck.
Also, because influenza-like viruses have been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza.
But there’s promising science in development.
Remember this?
This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is to store and move iron.
But it’s also the rough size and shape of a small virus.
And if you attach viral proteins to it, like this, you’d have something that looks, to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless and very engineerable.
Recently, scientists engineered a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies of the neck region of an H1 flu virus.
They vaccinated mice with the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose of a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; all the unvaccinated ones died.
Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions that we could take advantage of across different-but-related virus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses which cause some common colds.
Probably not well.
What is the smartest age?
In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible rapid growth, called synaptogenesis, where more than 1 million new neural connections are formed every second.
As the brain develops, it goes through a pruning process. Based on your experience and environment, used connections are strengthened and unused connections are removed.
Frequently used neuronal pathways are myelinated, wrapped in a layer of insulation, allowing information to travel faster.
This creates a more efficient, fine-tuned brain.
But this brain remodeling happens within and between brain regions at different times, allowing different skills to flourish at different ages.
For example, in childhood, brain regions involved in language learning develop quickly, which is why many children can learn and master multiple languages.
Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible for cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop.
As a result, some young children may struggle with strategic games, such as chess or checkers, which require constant concentration, planning, and abstract thought.
At the same time, children tend to be more flexible, exploration-based learners.
They often use more creative approaches when finding solutions to riddles and are, on average, less afraid to make mistakes.
But adults have their own unique set of abilities.
Adults benefit from a well-developed prefrontal cortex, allowing them to better execute skills that require learning, focus, and memory, making them quick and efficient puzzle solvers or crossword masters.
Late in adulthood, these same skills may decline as the brain’s memory center, known as the hippocampus, shrinks.
But there’s a reason for the phrase “older and wiser.
” After a lifetime of learning, older adults have more knowledge to recall and utilize, making them excellent trivia partners.
Other factors that Amir should consider are his own strengths.
As an adolescent, the prefrontal cortical regions of your brain are more developed than in childhood.
This allows you to better navigate logic and math puzzles.
Simultaneously, deep inside the brain, regions that are important in motivation and reward are developing even faster, driving teenagers like Amir to be curious and adventurous learners.
In many ways, you can think of the teenager as a jack-of-all-trades, with brains wired to seek out new experiences and learn quickly.
You’re at a dynamic stage, where the choices you make and the skills you focus on can actually guide the development of your brain.
So, what’s the smartest age?
There’s no single answer.
It’s 8, 16, 25, 65, and everything in between; our brains have adapted to prioritize different skills at various ages to meet that stage of life’s challenges and demands.
So no matter who Amir picks, having an age-diverse team is a good strategy.What is the smartest age?
Perhaps a day of friendly competition will lead us to the answer.
Tomorrow’s the annual Brain Clash— ten teams of two competing in a decathlon of mental challenges, trivia competitions, and puzzles.
I’ve been training all year.
I’ll need to pick the smartest, most capable teammate.
I’ve narrowed down the roster.
First we have Gabriela.
She may only be 8, but don’t underestimate her!
She’s fluent in two languages and is the ultimate outside-the-box thinker.
Then there’s Ama.
She can recite 100 digits of pi, designs satellites for a living, and bakes a perfect soufflé.
Or I could go with Mr. Taylor. He’s the best chess player in the neighborhood, not to mention he’s competed in over 20 Brain Clashes and is a five-time champion!
I’m not sure who to pick!
Who’s the smartest?
Which of these teammates should Amir choose for tomorrow's contest and why?
Of course, it depends.
While intelligence is often associated with things like IQ tests, these assessments fail to capture the scope and depth of a person’s varied abilities.
So instead, we’ll break down the idea of “smart” into categories like creativity, memory, and learning and explore when the brain’s best at each of them.
Let's start at the very beginning.
In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible rapid growth, called synaptogenesis, where more than 1 million new neural connections are formed every second.

So much of what happens in our bodies is metabolism, making new cells is metabolism, growing hair is metabolism, and converting food into energy is metabolism.
Unless you're a professional athlete, most of our calorie expenditure is accounted for by our basal metabolic rate.
All the vital stuff we need to function, like having a heartbeat, growing hair, building cells and even blinking.
The answer is no.
[Body Stuff with Dr. Jen Gunter] To answer that question, we have to first dig deeper into what metabolism is.
No surprise, metabolism is really complex, and scientists and researchers are still discovering many new things about it.
Very simply, metabolism is the set of chemical reactions in every cell of our body that harnesses energy to keep us alive.
So much of what happens in our bodies is metabolism, making new cells is metabolism, growing hair is metabolism, and converting food into energy is metabolism.
The sum total energy of all the metabolic processes that occur throughout our body is measured in calories.
And surprisingly, exercise is usually a small percentage of our daily calorie burn.
Unless you're a professional athlete, most of our calorie expenditure is accounted for by our basal metabolic rate.
All the vital stuff we need to function, like having a heartbeat, growing hair, building cells and even blinking.
That stuff takes up a big chunk of our energy.
So can we hack this equation in some way?
Can we use exercise to speed up our metabolism so we burn more energy?
Can we burn even more calories?
Not just doing burpees, but while we're growing an eyelash, than before?
The answer is no.
First of all, this is a misunderstanding of what fast versus slow metabolism really indicates.
There's no clear link between thinner people and fast metabolism, and the same goes for larger people and slow metabolism.
In fact, if you look at the absolute numbers, people with larger bodies have faster metabolisms, meaning they burn more calories because larger bodies have more cells, which in turn are doing more to sustain the body.
Now, differences in metabolism between people with similar body sizes do exist, but the difference between fast metabolism and slow metabolism can be about 300 calories.
That’s like two apples and a banana.
How fast our metabolism works is mostly genetic and related to body size, but there's also age.
Our metabolic rate changes a few times over our lifespan.
We start with the metabolic rate of an infant.
Then there is a switch when we are toddlers, and then it’s pretty stable during adulthood to age 60, when it changes again.
Researchers evaluated the Hadza, a group of people in Tanzania who live a traditional hunter gatherer lifestyle.
And yet, when you control for body size and age, they burn a similar amount of calories a day as an average American adult.
It seems that calories out is a pretty fixed number, and it appears that our bodies have limits.
If we exercise harder, at first we may expend more energy, but over time, our metabolism will find ways to conserve.
Here's what I'm getting at.
The point of our metabolic system is to manage energy, not to manage weight.
So if you read an article or hear a so-called expert inviting you to boost your metabolism, remember that’s just marketing speak rooted in a weight loss culture.
And it just isn’t true.
On February 7th, 1967, Homer Loutzenheuser flipped a switch in Nebraska and realized a dream more than five decades in the making.
The power grids of the United States joined together, forming one interconnected machine stretching coast to coast.
Today, the US power grid is the world's largest machine.
They’re massive feats of engineering— but their functioning depends on a delicate balance.
Their components must always work in unison, maintain a constant frequency throughout the grid, and match energy supply with demand.
If there's too much electricity in the system, you get unsafe power spikes that can overheat and damage equipment.
Too little electricity and you get blackouts.
So, to strike this balance, power grid operators monitor the grid from sophisticated control centers.
They forecast energy demand and adjust which power plants are active, signaling them to turn their output up or down to precisely meet current demand.
By considering factors like the availability and cost of energy resources, grid operators create a “dispatch curve,” which maps out the order in which energy sources will be used.
The grid defaults to using energy from the start of the curve first.
Usually, the resources are ordered by price.
Those at the start tend to be renewables because they have much lower production costs.
Some grids, like those in Iceland and Costa Rica, run on more than 98% clean energy.
But most dispatch curves contain more of a mix of carbon-free and carbon-emitting energy sources.
This means that where your electricity is coming from— and how clean it is— varies throughout the day— as often as every few minutes.
Take the state of Kansas. Despite having plentiful wind resources, it regularly relies on carbon-emitting power plants.
This is because wind energy is especially plentiful at night.
But, this is also when there’s lower demand.
So, Kansas’s wind energy is actually regularly disposed of to prevent excess electricity from damaging the grid.
And comparable scenarios add up to a big problem worldwide.
Thankfully, dependence on renewables is rising.
But power grids are often unable to make full use of them.
Many simply weren't designed around intermittent energy sources and can't store large amounts of electricity.
Researchers are experimenting with unique storage solutions.
However, this will take time and substantial investment.
But hope is not lost.
We have the opportunity to work with our existing power grids in a new way: by shifting some of our energy use to the times when there’s clean electricity to spare.
Leaning into this concept, called “load flexibility,” we can help flatten the peaks in demand, which will place less stress on the grid and reduce the need for non-renewables.
So researchers are developing automated emissions reduction technologies that tap into energy use data and ensure that devices get electricity from the grid at the cleanest times.
In fact, smart devices like this already exist.
So, how big an effect could they have?
If smart technologies like air conditioners, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers were implemented across the Texas power grid, the state’s emissions could decrease by around 20%.
In other words, simply coordinating when certain devices tap into the grid could translate to 6 million fewer tons of carbon released into the atmosphere annually from Texas alone.
Now, imagine what this could look like on a global scale.On February 7th, 1967, Homer Loutzenheuser flipped a switch in Nebraska and realized a dream more than five decades in the making.
The power grids of the United States joined together, forming one interconnected machine stretching coast to coast.
Today, the US power grid is the world's largest machine.
It contains more than 7,300 electricity-generating plants, linked by some 11 million kilometers of powerlines, transformers and substations.
Power grids span Earth’s continents, transmitting electricity around the clock.

In a recent survey, a majority of respondents picked their sense of smell as the one they'd be most willing to give up among the traditional five senses.
But if you love food, you should be giving your nose much more credit. Because it’s actually our sense of smell that plays a huge role in our ability to process flavor.
[Body Stuff with Dr. Jen Gunter] First, let's talk about how smell works, from coffee to stinky trash.
The substances around us give off volatiles, which you can think of as tiny smell molecules.
We breathe in these smell molecules, which then stimulate the olfactory sensory neurons that sit high in the nose.
Each of these neurons contains an odor receptor on its surface.
Once the odor receptors are triggered by these smell molecules, the neurons send information about them to the brain.
Here's what I think is so cool.
The brain not only categorizes that information as a particular odor, it may also begin to associate feelings, like pleasure or disgust and other moods and emotions with that odor for future reference.
For example, you sniff bacon, you eat it, your taste buds get salt, and then your body gets a whack of fat, which is an energy source.
So the brain loves it and attaches a positive label to it.
The next time you smell bacon, a sensation associated with pleasure arises.
Now, there are a lot of smells out there, more than our 400 or so odor receptors can detect.
But people with a healthy working sense of smell have odor receptors that can combine to detect anywhere between 10,000 to more than a trillion different odors.
Now, taste is completely different.
It comes from taste receptors on our tongues and in our mouths.
Taste is limited to the basics: salty, sweet, bitter, sour and, somewhat controversially, umami or savory.
There, olfactory neurons get all the complex smells from the pizza and send that information to the brain.
The smell and taste work together to help us enjoy food.
When our nose isn't working properly and food seems flavorless, it's because we're only tasting those basic tastes without any of the complex odors detected through smell.
So the next time you savor an amazing flavor, thank your nose.
Our sense of smell is what brings nuance to what we eat.
If I told you not to press this big red button, what would you do?
For many people, there’s no greater motivation to do something than being told they can’t.
So, what is it about being told “no” that triggers this response?
One of the most enduring explanations for this behavior is what psychologists call reactance theory.
This behavior plays out in public spaces, like when people ignore health campaigns they perceive as overbearing, and in private spaces, like parent-child relationships.
However, there are situations where something being forbidden actually makes it less tempting.
In 1972, psychologists at the University of Colorado wanted to know if a romantic relationship facing parental disapproval was more likely to strengthen or crumble under the pressure.
To answer this question, they surveyed 140 couples, varying widely in measures of happiness, but all fairly serious in terms of commitment.
Only some couples reported perceived parental opposition to their relationship over the study’s six-month period.
But those that did also reported a steady increase in love for one another.
The researchers named this trend the Romeo and Juliet Effect after literature’s most famous forbidden lovers and concluded that the results were largely motivated by reactance. But in the decades since this publication, most follow-up studies have suggested the opposite is true.
In fact, the long-term success of a romantic relationship can be predicted by the perceived approval or disapproval of the couple’s friends and family.
This trend is known as the Social Network Effect.
So why doesn’t reactance win out over the Social Network Effect?
You might think it’s because we value our existing relationships over our potential relationships. But in most cases, disapproving friends and family are just voicing negative opinions or passively not supporting a relationship. It’s rarely a dramatic choice of us or them.
And when it comes to parents, most people with good relationships with their parents feel they can ignore their parent’s advice without serious consequences, while people with bad parental relationships often don’t care what they think anyway.
So if disapproved relationships are more likely to fail, does this mean we’re not willing to fight to date who we want?
Well, it might vary from person to person.
One theory is that there’s actually two types of reactance: defiant reactance, which is impulsively doing the opposite of what we’re told, and independent reactance, which reflects our deeper desire to make our own choices.
For example, if you tell someone with high defiant reactance to lower their voice, they’ll probably start shouting.
Whereas someone with high independent reactance is more likely to simply ignore the request and do what they believe is appropriate.
So when it comes to relationship disapproval, a defiant person might respond by pursuing their romance in secret, but that doesn’t change how the group’s opinion negatively impacts their relationship.
Conversely, someone with a particularly independent personality might be capable of ignoring their friends’ concerns and loving whomever they want.
The idea of defiant and independent reactance is fairly new, and researchers are still working to uncover all the motivations behind the Social Network Effect.
But these theories help illuminate the important relationship between reactance and our competing needs for independence and inclusion.
How we balance these desires varies across individuals and cultures. But no matter how prone to reactance we may be, our social networks are vital to our sense of identity and well-being.
This is especially true in our romantic relationships. Studies have found that support from a few close companions can help buffer against disapproval from others.
For many people, there’s no greater motivation to do something than being told they can’t.
So, what is it about being told “no” that triggers this response?
One of the most enduring explanations for this behavior is what psychologists call reactance theory.

There's a grocery store in Brooklyn, New York, with sales per square foot 4 times as high as any other grocery store in the area.
Credit unions and mutual insurance companies are financial sector co-ops.
And when farmers or other producers come together, that's a producer co-op.
And at Mondragon workers, can vote to fire the president.
At a co-op, there’s no single person with overarching, top-down power over everyone else, like a CEO would have in a traditional company.
Meanwhile, in both co-ops and traditional companies, major company-wide decisions are made by voting.
But who votes and how is wildly different.
In a traditional company, voting rights usually come with shares of stock.
The more shares you own, the more votes you have.
Take Alphabet, the parent company of Google: there are thousands of shareholders, but the two founders control 51% of the votes and therefore the direction of the company.
In a co-op, every member has the right to vote, and in most co-ops, every member gets one vote.
That difference results in radically different policies than you’d find at traditional companies.
For example, Mondragon limits the salaries of its management to about 6 times what the lowest paid worker makes.
In Spain, CEOs of traditional companies make, on average, 143 times as much as a typical worker.
At Park Slope, there’s a monthly general meeting, where any member can show up to vote, and a motion needs a simple majority to pass.
It then gets taken up by the Board of directors, which is composed of co-op members, for official approval.
At The Cheeseboard, the worker-owners try to reach consensus on major decisions.
This means that some decisions can take a long time.
For example, in the late 1970s, the workers debated whether to post a sign outside declaring that The Cheeseboard was a collective for one and a half years.
But the extensive discussion, and disagreements, around that decision made it a solid one— The Cheeseboard still advertises the fact that it’s a collective almost 50 years later.
And that’s not all that’s working well at co-ops.
Studies in the UK show that co-op start-ups are almost half as likely to close within five years as traditional businesses.
And in one study, researchers polled 600 workers at two in-home healthcare businesses: one was a worker co-op and the other was a traditional company.
The workers did similar work with similar salaries.
The biggest difference?
Co-op workers were about 40% happier with their jobs.There's a grocery store in Brooklyn, New York, with sales per square foot 4 times as high as any other grocery store in the area.
10,000 people work there, and it doesn’t have a CEO.
This place is the Park Slope Food Co-op, and it’s one of 3 million cooperatives, or co-ops for short, around the world.
Co-ops are a big part of the global economy: they employ 280 million people— 10% of the world’s workforce and the equivalent of over $2 trillion flow through their doors every year.
How is it possible that a business with 10,000 workers doesn’t have a CEO?
To answer that, we have to talk about what a co-op is and why they were founded.
Let’s rewind to 1844. A group of 28 weavers in Rochdale, England came together to create and co-own a store.
By buying in bulk directly from suppliers, they could negotiate prices, which allowed all of them to buy stuff they couldn't otherwise afford.
They ran the store collectively and democratically, which was remarkable at the time.
The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers wasn't the world's first co-op, but it was the first to publicize its principles— principles that guide co-ops to this day.
Today, there are all kinds of co-ops: REI in the US and S-Group in Finland are large consumer co-ops.
Credit unions and mutual insurance companies are financial sector co-ops.
And when farmers or other producers come together, that's a producer co-op.
And then there are worker co-ops, like Mondragon in Spain or The Cheeseboard in Berkeley, California, which are founded to provide jobs to people in the community.
Some consumer co-ops, like Park Slope, require their members to work shifts in the store.
In exchange for their work, members pay 15 to 50% less for groceries, and they influence what products are— or aren’t— sold there.
Second, co-ops are not founded to maximize profit.
Many do turn a significant profit, but that’s not their core mission.
So evaluating a co-op purely by traditional business metrics ignores the most important reason for their existence: how well do they serve their members?
As co-ops get larger, they do institute some form of leadership or management.
And in one study, researchers polled 600 workers at two in-home healthcare businesses: one was a worker co-op and the other was a traditional company.
So to figure out what's going on here, let’s take a closer look at the mind-wanderer in chief: the bored teenager.
Wouldn’t it be cool to discover something, anything.
Like even this plant.
Just to be one of those explorers who sails around drawing stuff for years on end and everyone thinks they’re a genius.
But does anyone even do that anymore?
Is there anything left to discover?
And would I be tough enough to deal with the dysentery or scurvy or piranhas or whatever?
I barely have the endurance to make it through track practice. . . but I will.
Any day now, I’ll have the discipline to show up before sunrise and practice.
I’ll win all my races.
Winning will become so easy, I’ll pick up other events just for fun.
And once I'm in the Olympics, they’ll have no choice but to crown me team captain, which I will graciously accept.
And will I be nasty to the teammate who yelled at me? No. I’ll just calmly say, “hope you’re in a better mood.
” Okay.
Yours and other people's daydreams might sound or feel something like that.
Let's see what was going on.
To see what parts of the brain are active when you’re doing a task, or thinking, or daydreaming, scientists use brain imaging techniques that show increased blood flow and energy expenditure in those areas.
These brain areas are active, working together and communicating with each other.
Taken together, they're called the executive network.
When your mind starts to wander, a different set of brain areas becomes active.
These areas make up the default mode network.
The name default mode makes it sound like nothing is going on.
And in fact, for many years, scientists associated this pattern of activity with rest.
But a closer look reveals that these are the brain areas involved when we revisit a memory, when we think about our plans and hopes, and yes, when our minds are wandering off on a wild daydream.
The mind can wander to unproductive or distressing places and brood over negative past events, like an argument.
It can also wander to neutral, everyday matters, like planning out the rest of one's afternoon.
But where mind-wandering really gets interesting is when it crosses into the realm of free-moving associative thought that you aren’t consciously directing.
This kind of mind-wandering is associated with increases in both ideas and positive emotions, and the evidence suggests that daydreaming can help people envision ways to reach their goals and navigate relationships and social situations.
A host of imaging studies suggest that these two networks working in sync is a crucial condition for creative thinking.
Taken together, the evidence clearly suggests the logical realm of the executive network and the imaginative realm of the default mode network are closely related.
The year is 1194. Maurice De Bracy, enemy to the English crown, is locked in combat with a mysterious Black Knight.
Suddenly, the Black Knight gains the upper hand.
He whispers his true identity in De Bracy’s ear: King Richard the Lionheart of England.
De Bracy yields.
Later, De Bracy offers to let King Richard use his army of “Free Lances,” mercenary soldiers who were free to use their lances in service of whoever paid the most.
That’s how it plays out in Sir Walter Scott’s 1819 novel, “Ivanhoe.
” Scott didn’t coin the term, but it was probably this use that stuck, and evolved to describe someone who works independently of any single company.
In a survey conducted in the US, half of freelancers said there was no amount of money that would convince them to rejoin the traditional workforce.
At some point in your life— maybe even now— you might wonder whether freelancing is right for you.
You'll need a few things to be successful.
First, you'll need a skill that's in demand.
This can be as universal as driving a car to as specialized as neurosurgery, and it can be in pretty much any field.
The more people who want your skill, and the fewer people who have it, the more you can charge for your services.
Next, you’ll need to transform yourself into an entrepreneur.
Before freelancers can do any work, they have to find it.
That takes marketing your services, negotiating contracts, building a network of satisfied clients, and a whole set of administrative skills like project management, time management, and accounting.
And thirdly, if you can afford it, it's probably a good idea to budget for some benefits for yourself and maybe your family.
Freelancers don’t automatically get perks that some salaried jobs offer, like paid vacation or sick leave, life insurance, college tuition, or retirement plans.
In countries like the US, where the government doesn’t provide healthcare to most people, freelancers are responsible for that, too.
Freelancing has been around for a long time; but digital freelancing platforms like Uber, Lyft, and Fiverr are pretty new.
They say they’ll connect you with clients and take care of some of the entrepreneurial and administrative stuff so you can focus on the work.
But there are some hidden costs to consider.
First, your life may not be as flexible as you think.
For example, if you're a rideshare driver, you get to choose when to work, but not how: the app recommends what route to take, enforces how you act with the threat of low customer ratings, and sets your rate.
Those rates may be so low that you end up working more than if you had a salaried full-time job.
Speaking of rates, it can be hard to figure out exactly how much money you’ll make.
Earnings vary based on location; platforms might advertise hourly rates that don’t factor in expenses, and large scale data on actual earnings is sparse.
One of the largest data sets we have is from Uber.
It contains 740 million trips by 1.8 million drivers between 2015 and 2017. Researchers analyzed these figures in a 2018 paper and found that once you deduct Uber's cut and the cost of business expenses, drivers’ average earnings dropped from about $22 an hour to about $12 an hour.
And buying benefits would reduce that number even more.
And there is a lot of variability in working conditions across different gig platforms.
For example, the company 99 in Brazil operates a rideshare platform that many people use to deliver packages.
Drivers are matched with shippers, and 99 takes a cut.
The company’s terms and conditions hold both the shipper and the driver liable for anything that could go wrong— including things like if a package gets stolen.
If you’re considering joining the app economy and don’t want to read all the fine print, there’s a network of researchers who publish ratings of platforms based on five categories of fair employment.
Digital gig platforms come with drawbacks and may not provide a reliable living wage.
But for many around the world who don’t have the luxury of choice and need to make money as soon as possible, like, say, if you just lost your job, the gig economy is the easiest and fastest place to get hired.
For this reason, some have called it an “alternative safety net.
” So, considering all these factors and many others, should you dip your toes into the gig economy?
Or dive in?
Ask yourself: how much do you value flexibility or autonomy?
Do you prefer to work within an established structure, or to make your own?
Are you willing to network to find new clients?
Are you organized and self-directed?
And perhaps most importantly, how much do you value knowing exactly what you'll earn from week to week?
Picture this: you’re working a slow shift in a hotel lobby when someone hurriedly approaches the front desk.
They found a lost wallet around the corner, but they’re in a rush and don’t have time to follow up.
They ask if you can handle it and then run off.
Looking at the wallet you see it contains a key, a grocery list, about $13, and three business cards with a name and email you assume belong to the wallet’s owner.
So, what do you do?
Between 2013 and 2016, over 17,000 front-desk workers around the globe were faced with this choice, becoming unwitting participants in a massive study of honesty.
And the results surprised top economists and the researchers running the experiment.
But to understand what these groups were expecting, we need to spend a little time defining honesty.
We typically think of honesty in terms of actively telling the truth in our interpersonal relationships.
But in fact, every healthy society relies on a shared foundation of honesty.
Using public services, making business transactions, and deciding government policies requires a baseline expectation of honesty from our fellow citizens.
Because of this, understanding what drives honesty is a vital research subject for economists, psychologists, and sociologists.
Unfortunately, honesty can be difficult to investigate when people know they’re being watched.
So, researchers have come up with clever ways to analyze this behavior outside the lab.
And this global study by the universities of Michigan, Utah, and Zurich sought to answer an important question: will people engage in opportunistic behavior when there’s little-to-no chance of being caught?
In what became known as the Lost Wallet Test, 13 research assistants traveled to 355 cities in 40 different countries, recreating the same scenario in hotels, banks, public offices, and various cultural establishments.
The clear wallets ensured participants could see their contents, half of which contained a key, grocery list, and business cards, while the other half also included the equivalent of roughly 13 US dollars.
The researchers believed the money would discourage honesty.
Specifically, they thought participants’ self-interest would overpower two competing factors: their altruistic desire not to harm the wallet’s owner, and their desire to maintain a positive self-image.
Regarding self-image, we generally like to think of ourselves as good and honest.
But studies have found people are often able to let themselves off the hook for stealing small amounts of money.
As for harming the wallet's owner, the victim of their crime would be abstract.
They'd never met this person, and since the wallet had come from another location, it seemed unlikely they ever would.
For these reasons, researchers expected money-filled wallets to be reported less often, and the 279 economists they surveyed agreed.
But to their surprise, the study found the exact opposite.
While only 46% of cash-free wallets were reported, 61% of cash wallets were called in.
This pattern held true across the globe, regardless of the participants’ age, gender, or whether they were being observed during the wallet drop-off.
And when researchers tried increasing the temptation to be dishonest with wallets containing nearly $100, the results surprised them again.
People reported 72% of these big money wallets.
There are a lot of theories for why honesty goes up as the wallet becomes more valuable.
The $100 wallet certainly increases self-interest.
But in international follow-up surveys, people reported that taking larger sums of money felt more like theft, making it harder to maintain a positive self-image.
It’s also possible that when the financial stakes are higher, so is the perceived harm to the wallet’s owner.
Others have suggested that our commitment to honesty could be altered in professional settings, meaning participants might have acted differently outside the office.
Still, this result suggests that self-interest might not be as powerful as we often think.
Seeing yourself as an honest person can motivate you to be an honest person.
And by modeling this behavior and celebrating it and others, we can help create an honest society we can all rely on.
Let’s say you discover a magical gold coin that doubles every 25 years. 75 years later, you’d only have eight coins.
But 1,000 years later, you’d have over a trillion.
And in just 4,600 years, your gold coins would outweigh the observable universe.
This periodic doubling is an example of exponential growth, and while we’re not in any danger of discovering a real-life golden goose-coin, something almost as consequential has been growing like this for the past 200 or so years: the global economy.
Many economists think that an eternally growing economy is necessary to keep improving people’s lives, and that if the global economy stops growing, people would fight more over the fixed amount of value that exists, rather than working to generate new value.
That raises the question: is infinite growth possible on a finite planet?
We measure economic growth by tracking the total financial value of everything a country (or the world) produces and sells on the market.
These products can help us meet basic needs or improve our individual and collective quality of life.
But they also, crucially, take resources to invent, build, or maintain.
For example, this smartphone. It’s valuable in part because it contains aluminum, gallium, and silicon, all of which took energy and resources to mine, purify, and turn into a phone.
It’s also valuable because of all the effort that went into designing the hardware and writing the software.
And it’s also valuable because a guy in a black turtleneck got up on stage and told you it was.
So how do we grow the total financial value of all things?
One way is to make more things.
Another way is to invent new things.
However you do it, growing the economy requires resources and energy.
And eventually, won’t we just run out?
Over the past 200 years, economies have gotten exponentially more efficient at producing value.
If we, as a species, are able to keep upgrading our economies so that they get ever-more efficient, we could theoretically pump out more and more value using the same— or, let’s be really ambitious here— fewer resources.
So, how do we do that?
How do we increase efficiency?
With new technologies.
This is where we hit a snag.
New tech, in addition to making things more efficient, can also generate new demand, which ends up using more resources.
We’re actually not in imminent danger of running out of most resources.
But we have a much bigger and more immediate problem: the global economy, and in particular those of rich countries, is driving climate change and destroying valuable natural environments on which all of us depend— soil, forests, fisheries, and countless other resources that help keep our civilization running.
So, what should we do?
This is where economists disagree.
Most economists think that new ideas will be able to fix most of these problems.
They argue that, in the same way that exponentially increasing resource and energy use have fueled exponential economic growth, human ingenuity has also increased exponentially, and will rise to meet these challenges in ways that we simply can't predict.
For example, between 2000 and 2014, Germany grew their GDP by 16%, while cutting CO2 emissions by 12%.
That’s impressive, but it’s not cutting emissions fast enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
For this reason and others, some economists think the solution is to reengineer our economies completely.
They make the case that what we should really be doing is weaning ourselves from the addiction to growth and shifting to a post-growth economy.
What would that look like?
A post-growth economy wouldn’t assume that the economy should grow; instead, it would require us to focus on improving what we really need— things like renewable energy, healthcare, and public transportation.
To do that, post-growth economists suggest that rich countries should do things like guarantee living wages, reduce wealth and income inequality, and ensure universal access to public services, like healthcare.
In such an economy, people would be theoretically less dependent on their jobs to earn their living or get healthcare, so it might be more feasible to scale down production of things deemed less necessary.
But this raises other questions: who gets to define what’s necessary?
How would we resolve the inevitable disagreements?
Could we really do away with entire industries?
The “we’ll come up with new ideas to solve these problems” approach can seem as realistic as, well, a magical gold coin.
And the “we have to fundamentally change our economies” approach can seem politically daunting, particularly in rich countries.
One way or another, we have to find a way to benefit everyone while also taking care of our planet.Let’s say you discover a magical gold coin that doubles every 25 years. 75 years later, you’d only have eight coins.

However you do it, growing the economy requires resources and energy.
And eventually, won’t we just run out?
To answer this question, let's consider what goes into the economy and what comes out of it: its inputs are labor, capital— which you can think of as money— and natural resources, like water or energy.
Its output is value.
Over the past 200 years, economies have gotten exponentially more efficient at producing value.
If we, as a species, are able to keep upgrading our economies so that they get ever-more efficient, we could theoretically pump out more and more value using the same— or, let’s be really ambitious here— fewer resources.

Beginning in the 3rd century, before the coming era, the Romans conquered the Iberian Peninsula.
This period gave rise to several regional languages in the area that's now Spain, including Castilian, Catalan and Galician.
One of these would become Spanish— but not for another 1,500 years.
Those years tell the origin story of what’s become a global modern language.
During the Roman occupation, colloquial spoken Latin, often called “Vulgar Latin,” mixed with Indigenous languages.
Approximately 75% of modern Spanish comes from Latin, including syntactic rules.
For instance, verbs are conjugated in a similar way as in Latin.
And like other Roman languages, nouns have gender: el sol, the sun, is masculine, whereas la luna, the moon, is feminine.
After the Roman Empire collapsed, a series of other powers conquered the region.
Then the Umayyad Caliphate ousted the Visigoths.
These often have a starting “a” or “z” sound, and sometimes include an “h.
From Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire, came words with “ch” and “y” like “chapulin” and “coyote.
This period gave rise to several regional languages in the area that's now Spain, including Castilian, Catalan and Galician.
Those years tell the origin story of what’s become a global modern language.
Then the Umayyad Caliphate ousted the Visigoths.
” In 1492, the Catholic Church consolidated its power through two monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, expelling Muslims and Jews, combining the distinct regional kingdoms into one nation, and adopting one of the local languages as the official state language.
That language was Castellano, or Castilian, from the Kingdom of Castile, which was centrally located in Spain and home to Madrid.
Thereafter Castellano became Español, or Spanish.
But the Spanish of 1492 was Old Spanish, very different from Spanish today.
That same year, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, marking the start of the Spanish conquest of the Americas.
The Indigenous population of the Americas spoke an estimated 2,000 different languages.
Over the next few decades, most of them were forced to adopt Spanish at the expense of their own languages.
Still, words from Indigenous languages became part of Spanish.
From Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire, came words with “ch” and “y” like “chapulin” and “coyote.
” From Quechua, a language spoken in the Peruvian Andes, came words with “ch” like “cancha,” “chullo,” and “poncho.
” Some of these words describe things that hadn’t existed in the Spanish lexicon before, while others replaced existing Spanish words even in Spain.
By the time Miguel de Cervantes published the first part of “Don Quixote” in 1605, the language was arguably more similar to modern Spanish than plays of one of his contemporaries, William Shakespeare, were to modern English.
Starting in the 18th century, French language and culture were extremely fashionable in Spain, and later Hispanic America.
While the two languages already had commonalities from their shared roots in Latin, Spanish gained new words from French during this period.
In the 19th century, all over Central and South America, people revolted to gain independence from Spain.
In the newly sovereign nations, people continued to speak the language of their former oppressors.
Today, there are approximately 415 million inhabitants of Hispanic America.
Spanish is the official language of 21 countries and Puerto Rico.
As of 2021, only English, Mandarin, and Hindi have more speakers.
How does a language with so many speakers around the world not break apart into new languages the way Vulgar Latin did?
There's no easy answer to this question.
Other languages that spread through colonialism, like French, have mixed with Indigenous languages to form entirely new ones.
Some would argue that Spanglish, a mixture of Spanish and English, is a distinct language or on its way to becoming one.
But although a person in Buenos Aires occasionally might use words that aren’t fully intelligible to someone in Bogotá or Mexico City, Spanish retains enough unity of syntax, grammar, and vocabulary to remain one language.
Gold is one of Earth’s most valuable resources, with one kilogram regularly valued at over 55,000 US dollars.
In 2020, Mali produced an estimated 71.2 tons of gold.
But Mali only saw $850 million from gold in 2020, when that amount is worth billions, not to mention that the country likely produced much more than the reported 71.2 tons.
The situation isn’t unique: a number of other gold-rich countries in Africa, including Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Niger also aren’t seeing the income they should, given the price of gold.
The force behind this is greed on an individual, corporate, and national scale, and a corrupt system that perpetuates itself.
Although Mali has abundant gold, the country lacks the infrastructure to mine and export it.
So the government allows multinational corporations to apply for licenses to mine gold in exchange for taxes paid to Mali’s government.
These taxes should, theoretically, finance development, like building the infrastructure to mine gold, improve the economy, and provide citizens with public goods like healthcare and education.
Tax money alone isn’t enough to do these things, of course: a government also has to be invested in its people’s well-being, and government corruption can prevent progress.
But without adequate funds, even the best intentioned government doesn’t stand a chance of improving circumstances for its citizens.
Foreign corporations exploit Mali’s need for tax revenue to get the government to sign on to very unfavorable yet perfectly legal contracts.
For example, one such contract stated that no corporate taxes would be owed for the first five years, costing Mali millions in tax revenue.
Meanwhile, mining licenses sometimes allow these corporations to take samples of gold out of the country without registering them or paying taxes on them.
They filter profits through a labyrinth of tax havens that’s difficult to trace.
Or they exaggerate their expenses so they end up owing very little in taxes.
For instance, a corporation in Mali uses a subsidiary in Ireland to manage its operations and another subsidiary in the Netherlands to license its brand name.
The corporation in Mali pays management fees to the Irish subsidiary and pays intellectual property license fees to the Dutch company, all for enormous sums.
These costs are deducted from overall profits, leaving the amount subject to taxes at a bare minimum.
These companies also buy gold on the black market.
Local, small-scale miners often operate without a license, so the government is unaware of how much gold they mine.
Corporations buy gold from these miners, avoiding the cost of mining the gold themselves, and pay the miners far below market value.
Then they turn around and tell the government they incurred huge expenses mining gold they didn’t mine at all.
There’s no way for Mali’s revenue authority to verify this information, causing the country to lose even more tax money.
Similarly, corporations pay corrupt government officials to help them smuggle gold across borders, primarily to the United Arab Emirates, rather than operating through legal channels.
In 2016, Mali reported around $200 million of exported gold, but the UAE reported receiving slightly over $1.5 billion of imported gold from Mali that same year.
The gold is then sold to European, American, and Asian markets from the UAE, with no questions asked about its origins.
Similar patterns can be seen with gold-rich countries across Africa, indicating that gold smuggling is happening on a massive scale, without ever being subject to taxes.
All of this creates a vicious cycle, forcing a continued reliance on the corporations that helped create the situation in the first place.
More than half of Mali’s citizens live below the international poverty line, while their nation’s wealth lines the pockets of foreign corporations and corrupt officials.
What’s the best country in the world to live in?
Is it the one with the best food?
The longest life expectancy?
The best weather?
” and “What type of day was yesterday?
Welcome to the gates of hell.
Now its name may not scream “tourist trap,” but believe me, it is a beautiful part of the world and you should all try and visit sometime.
But more importantly, it could play -- It has the potential to play a crucial role in the fight against global climate catastrophe.
The most recent IPCC reports are clear.
Humanity has left cutting emissions too late.
Any realistic path to avoiding unacceptable levels of warming now requires us to not only drastically cut emissions, at least halving them by 2030, but also undertake an equally massive effort to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere at an accelerating rate.
Now, let's be clear.
Greenhouse gas removal is not and cannot be an excuse for continuing to emit.
Just as installing seat belts and airbags is not an excuse for deliberately ramming your car into a wall.
It is going to be damn difficult to do.
So how do we do it?
Well, the first and most familiar measures would be interventions such as reforestation and landscape restoration.
Essentially giving Mother Nature the time and space to heal herself.
In addition, we can increase the amount of carbon held in our soils through the widespread application of biochar and enhanced weathering of chemically suitable rocks.
Moreover, they are subject to some of the feedback loops from the climate change that we are already experiencing, such as more frequent and intense wildfires.
And all of that means we are going to need to supplement them with technologies that accelerate and amplify natural processes to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Enter the members of my new favorite boy band.
DAC, BECCS and BiCRS.
(Laughter) These are a set of engineered approaches that use physical, chemical and biological processes to gather and concentrate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere before safely sequestering it, usually underground.
As more people run the climate math, you're seeing growing levels of interest and investment in these technologies, with billions of dollars already being committed to early pilots and installations in various parts of the world, particularly in Europe and North America.
But the reality is they have a very long way to go.
To date, engineered removals around the world have accounted for something like 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide removed total.
To get to the multi-billion-ton scale we’re going to need by 2050 is going to take a truly epic process of exponential scaling.
Probably means we need to get to something -- If we want to have a realistic shot at it, we need to get to something like 100 million tons per year by 2030. For those of you running the calculators, that's a thousand-fold increase in less than a decade.
And guess what?
We will have to continue that insane rate of growth for another two decades after that.
And here's the really bad news.
Anything close to that level of scaling of this industry in the places where it’s currently being piloted presents some really difficult climate action trade offs.
For that, let me take the example of DAC or direct air capture.
The best known DAC facility in the world is in Iceland.
It's the Orca plant in Iceland, it was inaugurated last year, 2021. It uses plentiful green geothermal energy to capture carbon dioxide, dissolve it in water and inject it into porous basalt deep underground, where it chemically reacts to create a stable solid that can stay there for centuries.
It takes the equivalent of between two and three megawatt hours of energy to take a single ton of carbon dioxide today and render it in that way.
To get to the hundred million number in 2030, on that track, would entail something like 200 to 300 terawatt hours of electricity.
Again, that's about half the electricity usage of Germany.
And all of that power would need to be renewable, otherwise, we would be taking two steps forward and one and a half steps back.
Essentially, every unit of renewable energy that we are bringing on stream in places like North America and Europe should be going towards displacing and retiring existing fossil fuel capacity.
And so the world is kind of stuck. Right?
We need to scale this technology.
We need to get DAC down the cost curve and up the efficiency curve urgently.
Our lives literally depend on it.
But at the same time, we cannot do it except at the expense of other equally urgent climate imperatives.
So we need places in the world that somehow have three characteristics.
A, they need to have the right geophysical conditions.
You know, plenty of porous basalt rock in a geothermally active zone is one such example.
Two, they need to have plenty of renewable energy potential.
And three, they need to have no current proximate emissions that that renewable energy could be used to displace.
And that brings us back to Hell's Gate National Park.
Here's another view of the park from an angle that may explain its potential.
That is one of the power plants that together constitute the Olkaria Geothermal Energy Plant, which provides about a third of Kenya's electricity.
That's right.
My home country not only has 92 percent renewable electricity being dispatched on its grids today, but its largest single-energy installation is seamlessly integrated into an honest-to-goodness national park.
Literally, between the different plants you can see herds of zebra peacefully grazing all times of the day.
It's amazing.
Now at just under 1,000 megawatts, Olkaria is nothing to sneeze at.
It's one of the largest geothermal electricity installations in the world.
But it's barely scratching the surface of the potential in Kenya.
There's 10 gigawatts of proven, high-quality geothermal resource in the country, widely recognized, ready to be tapped.
And in addition, Kenya is endowed with excellent wind and solar resources that have also barely been exploited.
We are on the equator, after all.
We estimate conservatively that there's about 50 gigawatts of potential deployable renewable energy in Kenya that can be readily accessed with the right level of investment.
And yet, Kenya remains an energy-poor country where, despite a lot of progress in recent years, more than a quarter of the population still does not have access to basic electricity.
And those that do often pay prices that are almost three times as much as much as their counterparts in countries like India and China.
” And you would be right.
Were it not for a particularly cruel paradox of energy economics in countries like Kenya.
You see, part of the reason why energy is so expensive in the country is those consumers who are on the grid have to pay for capacity that is not currently being used.
There's something like 1,000 megawatt hours every day that goes begging because there isn’t sufficient industrial demand.
At the same time, those very same high energy prices make the country unattractive and uncompetitive for manufacturers and other users of energy looking for places to site their industries.
So to get this straight, the reason why the average Kenyan cannot get affordable access to clean, renewable energy despite all of this natural bounty, is this tremendously frustrating feedback loop where firstly, we would have all of that energy if someone invested in renewable power plants.
People would invest in those power plants if there was a lot of available industry to use the energy.
Available industry would come if energy costs weren’t so high.
And energy costs wouldn’t be so high if there was enough demand.
It's enough to drive you crazy.
But it also points the way to a potential huge triple opportunity.
Firstly, introducing DAC and other energy-hungry climate technology into places like the Rift Valley would give them the space and capacity they need to really scale to planetary levels.
With no competition, with none of the trade-offs they would face in other parts of the world.
At the same time, having that energy-hungry anchor industry available suddenly creates the basis on which people are willing to invest in expanding the country's renewable energy potential.
Actually creating the business case for providing tens of millions of people with the productive energy they need to improve the quality of their lives.
And thirdly, introducing these new and exciting technologies on the continent with the world's youngest and fastest-growing workforce could potentially activate their imaginations and their energies towards becoming climate innovators and solution builders themselves, basically building an army from the world's largest workforce to solve the world's biggest problem.
I call it the “Great Carbon Valley.
” And it's just one of the ways in which Africa, as the continent, which, per capita, is the closest to net-zero and has contributed the least to climate change, can play a role in helping the planet avert climate disaster.
But in addition, it can do more and be the first continent to go substantially net-negative.
We're used to thinking about the continent in terms of its forests, its peatlands, its grasslands, its wetlands that need to be preserved.
And we should definitely continue to invest in the Indigenous communities, the smallholder farmers and the local innovators who are protecting and expanding natural carbon sinks.
But that should not blind us to the fact that Africa also provides an ideal potential home for scaling the latest and most ambitious of climate technologies.
Whichever of these narratives most speaks to you, one thing should be clear.
We need to shake the old, tired idea that Africa is a poor, hapless, helpless climate change victim.
Instead, Africa and its people have the potential.
They can, and they should, be the world’s climate vanguard.
Thank you. (Applause and cheers)
Every color you see in front of you can be found in nature.
Some plant, animal, or mineral bears almost every hue imaginable.
But which of these colors are you least likely to see in the natural world?
There are two factors that drive the rarity of color in nature: physics and evolution.
Let’s start with physics.
Colors are generated when wavelengths of light interact with objects, and most of the colors you’ve seen outside a screen were produced in one of two ways.
In absorption-based colors, certain wavelengths are absorbed by an object, while others are not.
The result is a matte final color generated by these leftover light waves.
Most naturally occurring colors fall into this category, including those of many fruits and flowers.
Plants are full of compounds called pigments that absorb light waves as part of photosynthesis, the process by which they convert sunlight into energy.
While different plants have evolved different pigments that result in different colors, higher energy wavelengths are more easily absorbed than lower energy ones.
And blue light has some of the highest energy wavelengths in the visible spectrum.
Numerous pigments have evolved to absorb blue light, including chlorophyll, which absorbs blue and red wavelengths to produce nature’s trademark green.
However, green light is still fairly energetic, and the most common class of pigments evolved to absorb these wavelengths as well.
There are over 1,100 types of carotenoids, pigments which absorb high energy blue and green light, while leaving behind the lower energy red and yellow light.
While carotenoids are present in most green plants, they only become visible each fall when chlorophyll gets broken down to save energy for the winter.
But whether they’re working alone or side by side, these pigments absorb blue light in virtually all plants.
Even fruits and flowers that appear blue actually have pigments that are red or purple, and only truly turn blue under specific chemical conditions.
So, is blue the rarest color in nature?
Not quite.
Absorption is just one of the two main ways light generates color.
In the second method, some wavelengths are scattered and amplified— overpowering the others to determine an object's final color.
These structural colors occur because some objects around us are made of microscopic particles which can form nanostructures that interfere with visible light.
For example, this feather has no blue pigments in it.
But when light strikes it, the electrons within its nanostructure vibrate at the same frequency as the wave.
This makes the particles send out a new wave with the same frequency, starting a chain reaction that amplifies and scatters blue light.
Nanostructures of various shapes and sizes scatter different wavelengths, but they typically scatter high-energy wavelengths most easily— making blue the most common structural color.
Meanwhile, low-energy wavelengths like red are only weakly scattered.
Even when something evolves specific nanostructures that strongly scatter red light they still resonate with other wavelengths, only appearing red at some angles of illumination and observation.
This gives us two contenders for nature’s rarest color: absorption-based matte blues and structural iridescent reds.
Only a handful of animals and rocks scatter red light and none of them scatter red light exclusively.
But since red and blue are rare in one way and common in another, we actually end up seeing both colors quite often.
Not to be confused with purple, which is just a combination of red and blue light, violet occupies a small portion of the visible light spectrum.
There are only a few nanostructures precise enough to exclusively scatter violet light.
And violet wavelengths are even more energetic than blue ones, making them likely to be absorbed by pigment.
So if you ever stumble onto the iridescent violet wings of a purple emperor butterfly, take a second to appreciate one of nature’s rarest spectacles.
Your plan to set up your friend Carey with your acquaintance Emerson is finally coming together.
And not just by 5 minutes; we’re talking 20 or even 30 minutes late.
Carey seems to view punctuality as an oppressive relic of an earlier era.
Take a moment to think: what you would do?
Maybe you should lie!
Your lie would pave the way for a potentially happy relationship.
Suppose a murderer were hunting Carey down.
Most people generally feel some regret about lying, even when they believe it’s the right thing to do.
This suggests there’s something inherently objectionable about lying— even when it leads to more happiness.
This might be fine if that person is a literal child.
But it seems disrespectful to treat a peer paternalistically.
Trying to protect Carey from what you consider to be a bad choice would show a lack of respect for their autonomy.
But other philosophers believe that such conflicts can only be resolved on a case-by-case basis, depending on various details and on the individuals involved.
Both individuals have heard all about each other and they’re eager to meet for dinner.
You really want this relationship to work, so. . . should you lie?
Take a moment to think: what you would do?
Your lie would pave the way for a potentially happy relationship.
But isn't it morally wrong to lie?
You might think, though, that this stance overstates the moral importance of lying.
Suppose a murderer were hunting Carey down.
Now, to be fair, most lies do seem likely to create unhappiness.
Someone who accepts a lie believes something which is false, and trying to conduct your life on the basis of false information doesn’t usually go well.
Most people generally feel some regret about lying, even when they believe it’s the right thing to do.
This suggests there’s something inherently objectionable about lying— even when it leads to more happiness.
In this case, lying to Carey would be an instance of Paternalism.
Followers of Kant would say treating others with respect is the heart of moral conduct, while followers of Mill would say nothing is more important than happiness.
If a match can be made, the surgery can begin.
After the old heart is removed, the surgeon begins sewing the donor heart into place.
During this period, the transplanted organ has a higher resting heart rate and risk of stroke, making exercise difficult and dangerous.
And since it’s incredibly rare to find a perfect match between donor and recipient, the immune system will also have some response to the new heart.
They need help from the community.
And so what we've had these last few years is like a horrific global fire.
It's increased the health inequities between the rich and the poor.
And so we have all that knowledge to build a prevention system.
COVID-19 can be the last pandemic if we take the right steps.
So how, what are these steps?
Well, let's go back and look at what the Romans did.
Think about how, over time, we've gotten good at preventing big fires.
Fire prevention is kind of this pervasive thing.
It's well funded.
It's well understood.
If an alarm went off right now, everyone here would know we're supposed to calmly gather, go out and wait instructions.
We'd know that help would be on the way because we have lots of trained firefighters who practice.
The United States alone has 370,000 full-time firefighters, even more than I guessed that number would be.
We also have access to water.
The United States, for example, has almost nine million fire hydrants.
And so that type of investment, that type of practice, that type of system is what we need to stop pandemics.
Now, often in movies, we'll have pandemics.
And I'm always impressed with what takes place.
Let's look at an example of this rapid response.
[Motaba River Valley, Zaire] (Helicopter rotors whirring) Well, that's quite impressive.
We don't need the music, but otherwise we saw exactly what should happen.
An outbreak’s detected.
Very quickly, literally within days, doctors are dispatched.
They have a helicopter to get into exactly ground zero.
They go in there, and they’ve got the right tools.
And this is what should happen when an outbreak is spotted.
But we don't have that team, we don't have those resources.
And if an outbreak took place in a low-income country, it could be literally months before we started to orchestrate those resources.
So despite what you see in movies, there is no group of experts standing by to prevent this disaster.
So we have to create a new team.
I believe we should create what I call the GERM team.
Germ stands for Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization.
This group is full-time.
Their only priority is pandemic prevention.
It's made up of a diverse set of specialists with a lot of different realms of expertise: epidemiologists, data scientists, logistics experts.
And it's not just scientific and medical knowledge.
They also have to have communication and diplomacy skills.
The cost of this team is significant.
It's over a billion a year to support the 3,000 people who would be on this team.
And its mission is to stop outbreaks before they become pandemics.
The work would be coordinated by the WHO.
They'd be present in many locations around the world, stationed in public health agencies.
They'd work closely with the national teams, depending on the income level.
They'd have more in the lower-income countries.
You know, for example, we could have GERM members say an epidemiologist, working out of the Africa CDC office in Abuja.
And a very important thing is that like firefighters, a GERM team would do drills.
The health systems are the front line.
What is the sequence of that?
Now, with the right investments, we can have a whole new generation of tools, better diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.
When we look at vaccines, they were the miracle of this epidemic.
So I'm talking about investments in three broad areas: Disease monitoring, that's GERM.
This won't be cheap, but it'll save lives.
And even it'll save money in the long run.
It's like an insurance policy.
The cost to prevent the next pandemic will be tens of billions of dollars.
But let's compare that to what we just went through.
The IMF estimates that COVID has cost nearly 14 trillion dollars.
And so we need to spend billions in order to save trillions.
And here's the best part of this.
Even when we're not having an outbreak, these investments like the Lumira, those new vaccines, they will make people healthier.
They'll shrink the gap, the health equity gap, which is gigantic, between rich and poor countries.
For example, we can detect more HIV cases and do a better job of treatment.
We can reduce deaths from malaria.
We can get more people high-quality care.
And so this is not just a downer about how to stop things from getting worse, but also a chance to make things better.
If we take the right steps, we can make COVID-19 the last pandemic, and we can build a healthier, more equitable world for everyone.
Thank you.
(Applause) Helen Walters: Thank you so much.
I have a few follow-up questions and one is really about the formal status of GERM.
So you mentioned this would cost a billion dollars, you mentioned it comes through the WHO, but exactly who's running this, how does this work, how do we make this happen?
BG: Well, GERM does not exist.
It's a proposal I'm putting forward that hopefully over the next year, while the pain of the pandemic is still clear in people's minds, will get a global consensus.
The rich-world governments will have to step up like they do with all the aid things and come up with that money.
The way the personnel systems works, so that it's under WHO, but a really top-notch team, there will be a lot of debate about how to do that well.
So, you know, I'm putting it forward and hopefully within the next year we'll get that consensus.
HW: Who do you need to pick that up next?
BG: Well, it's really the rich-world governments.
The WHO has this big yearly meeting, the World Health Assembly, and at some point somebody will put forward a resolution and we'll see if the extra resources can be put in for that.
After World War II, we did a lot.
You know, we created the United Nations, we talked a lot about war.
So I'd be stunned, although, you know, so far the action has been less than I would have expected, I'd be stunned if we don't go forward with something pretty close to what I'm laying out there.
HW: This has been pretty personal for you. You know, the anti-vaxxers are out there, they are loud, and this has become personal.
I just wanted to ask, like, how are you managing that?
BG: Well, it's kind of weird. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, our foundation, the Gates Foundation, is very involved in vaccines, the invention of new vaccines, funding vaccines.
And we're very proud that through joint efforts like GAVI, that saved tens of millions of lives.
(Laughter) I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that information.
(Laughter) You know, does this turn into something where, you know, there's constantly crazy people showing up?
Who knows?
But, you know, hopefully, as the pandemic calms down, people are more rational about, hey, vaccines are a miracle and there's a lot more we can do.
HW: So the future is in our hands in the present.
Bill Gates, thank you so much for being here.
BG: Thank you. (Applause)In the year 6 CE, a fire devastated Rome.
In response, Emperor Augustus did something that had never been done before in the history of the Empire.
He created a permanent team of firefighters who used buckets just like this one.
Augustus understood that individuals alone can't protect themselves from fires.
They need help from the community.
It's increased the health inequities between the rich and the poor.
Survival depended partly on your income, your race, the neighborhood you lived in.
Also a life free from the fear of the next COVID-19. When I was on this stage in 2015, I was one of many people who said we weren't ready and we needed to get ready.
We didn't.
But 90 percent of the views were after it was too late.
An outbreak’s detected.
Very quickly, literally within days, doctors are dispatched.
And it's not just scientific and medical knowledge.
They also have to have communication and diplomacy skills.
The cost of this team is significant.
It's over a billion a year to support the 3,000 people who would be on this team.
And its mission is to stop outbreaks before they become pandemics.
The work would be coordinated by the WHO.
They'd be present in many locations around the world, stationed in public health agencies.
They'd work closely with the national teams, depending on the income level.
They'd have more in the lower-income countries.
You know, for example, we could have GERM members say an epidemiologist, working out of the Africa CDC office in Abuja.
And a very important thing is that like firefighters, a GERM team would do drills.
When you want to have quick response, when you want to make sure you have all the pieces there and you can move very quickly, practice is key.
That's how you make sure everyone knows what to do.
Now, this team, there could be periods where there's no risky outbreak and they can keep their skills strong by working on some of the other infectious diseases, but that would be a second priority.
They would work with countries to strengthen their health systems.
The health systems are the front line.
You need to know if, say, a lot of people show up with a new kind of cough, that’s when GERM needs to look into it and say, is this an outbreak?
Is there a new pathogen here?
What is the sequence of that?
And so for all of this, the first 100 days are key.
Viruses spread exponentially.
And so if you get in there when the infection rate is fairly small, you can actually stop the spread.
You know, in this epidemic, if we'd been able to stop it within 100 days, we would have saved over 98 percent of the lives.
Now, we did have countries that did a good job.
Australia is an example.
They orchestrated diagnostic capacity.
They came up with distancing policies and quarantine policies.
And so their overall death rate per capita will be well less than a 10th of other countries.
But we did not, as a world, contain it.
And that's what we have to do next time.
When COVID struck, we were almost like Rome before they had fire buckets and firefighters.
We didn't have the people, the systems or the tools we need.
Now, with the right investments, we can have a whole new generation of tools, better diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.
We can have these all over the world that can test for any number of diseases.
It’s a 10th as expensive as PCR, it’s absolutely as accurate, and it’s simple.
A lot of the tools, the diagnostic tools and those infection-blocking tools are important because they can be staged in advance.
When we look at vaccines, they were the miracle of this epidemic.
In this case, there were lots of breakthrough infections.
We need vaccines that are broad spectrum, so they work against most of the emerging variants, which we did not have this time.
And we also need factories that are standing by so we can build enough vaccines for the entire world within six months and achieve far better equity.
And finally, and the most expensive, is improved health systems.
They'll shrink the gap, the health equity gap, which is gigantic, between rich and poor countries.
For example, we can detect more HIV cases and do a better job of treatment.
We can reduce deaths from malaria.
We can get more people high-quality care.
And so this is not just a downer about how to stop things from getting worse, but also a chance to make things better.
If we take the right steps, we can make COVID-19 the last pandemic, and we can build a healthier, more equitable world for everyone.
Thank you.

In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there’s a banishment spell that declares, “Be far from me, O vile cockroach.
” More than 3,000 years later, we’re still trying to oust these insects.
But from poison traps to hastily brandished slippers, cockroaches seem to weather just about everything we throw at them.
So what makes cockroaches so hard to kill?
99% of them live in a range of habitats where they play important ecological roles by recycling dead or decaying organic matter and nourishing other animals.
So when infected, the cockroach’s immune system efficiently unleashes many antimicrobial molecules.
But contrary to popular belief, cockroaches would probably not survive a nuclear apocalypse.
They would die near the sites of nuclear explosions and would still be severely compromised miles away.
Or maybe cockroaches would find even more surprising ways to thrive long after we’re gone.In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there’s a banishment spell that declares, “Be far from me, O vile cockroach.
” More than 3,000 years later, we’re still trying to oust these insects.
But from poison traps to hastily brandished slippers, cockroaches seem to weather just about everything we throw at them.
So what makes cockroaches so hard to kill?
There are nearly 5,000 cockroach species.
99% of them live in a range of habitats where they play important ecological roles by recycling dead or decaying organic matter and nourishing other animals.
But a couple dozen species adapted to live in close association with humans.
German and American cockroaches are among the most common.
And they owe their resilience to a combination of physical and chemical adaptations.
When it comes to old-fashioned removal methods, they're troublingly tenacious.
An American cockroach’s sensory hairs or structures pick up subtle air currents and rapidly send signals to its central nervous system.
The roach can then turn and sprint away within a few milliseconds.
And it’s among the fastest invertebrates ever recorded, reaching speeds of up to 50 body lengths per second.
This would be the human equivalent of running more than 300 kilometers per hour.
And finding a hiding place is no problem.
With its flattened, flexible body, an American cockroach can squeeze into spaces less than a quarter of its height.
Even if we do land a hit, it can withstand compressive forces of up to 900 times its own weight by distributing the impact along its body.
And the cockroach’s toughness doesn’t end there.
Cockroaches can eat a variety of organic matter, including hair, dead skin, adhesives, and paper.
This is made possible by an expansive set of digestive enzymes.
Cockroaches are able to thrive even in nutrient-poor environments.
Roaches often eat decaying foods that are low in nitrogen— an essential component of DNA and proteins.
But they survive by storing nitrogen-containing wastes in their bodies and having a resident group of bacteria recycle the nitrogen into useful molecules for them.
Meanwhile, German cockroaches will eat their own poop, vomit, and dead or dying colony members without hesitation.
These genes are often duplicated many times over.
But if a resistant roach is exposed to pyrethroids, it’ll be just fine.
The cockroach also produces more detoxification enzymes, which render the pesticide harmless, and the cockroach simply excretes it as a waste.
So far, they're already resistant to 43 different chemicals.
But contrary to popular belief, cockroaches would probably not survive a nuclear apocalypse.
Or maybe cockroaches would find even more surprising ways to thrive long after we’re gone.
This accusation comes as a total shock.
In your experience, your partner has always been gentle and loving, and you can't imagine them committing a grisly murder.
But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.
Your spouse insists they're innocent.
“I know it looks bad,” they say, “but you have to believe me!
If you don’t, who will?
” Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence against them looks damning?
Take a second to think what you would believe in this situation.
This dilemma is part of what philosophers call the ethics of belief: a field of study that explores how we ought to form beliefs, and whether we have ethical duties to believe certain things.
The question here isn't about what you should do, such as whether or not you should find your spouse guilty in a court of law.
After all, you wouldn’t be on the jury in their trial!
Rather, it’s about what you should believe to be true.
So, what factors should you consider?
Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence.
After all, to believe something is to take it to be true.
And evidence is, by definition, all information that helps us determine what's true.
From this, some philosophers draw the conclusion that evidence is the only thing that ought to determine what you believe.
This view is called evidentialism, and a strict evidentialist would say it doesn’t matter that the accused is your spouse.
You should evaluate the evidence from a neutral, objective point of view.
Taking the perspective of an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character is a relevant consideration.
But finding their fingerprints at the crime scene is surely stronger evidence.
So, from an evidentialist point of view, you should either believe your spouse is guilty, or at best remain undecided.
Some philosophers present evidentialism only as a view of what’s most rational to believe.
But others, like 19th century evidentialist W. K. Clifford, think that following the evidence is also morally required.
One argument for this view is that having well-informed, accurate beliefs is often vitally important to determining the ethical way to act.
Another argument is that there’s something unethical about being dishonest, and refusing to follow the evidence is a way of being dishonest with oneself.
However, perhaps there are other ethical factors in play.
Although the evidence against your spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that they’re actually innocent.
Think for a moment about how it would feel to be innocent, and have no one believe you— not even your own partner!
By not trusting your spouse, you run the risk of seriously hurting them in their crucial hour of need.
Moreover, consider what this lack of trust would do to your marriage.
It would be incredibly difficult to continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed— or even strongly suspected— was a murderer.
You might try to pretend to believe that your spouse is innocent, but could you really go on living that lie?
According to a theory of the ethics of belief called pragmatism, these kinds of practical considerations can sometimes make it right to believe something even without strong evidence.
Some pragmatists would even say that you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them.
But is it even possible to believe your spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good for your relationship?
Or because you think you owe it to the accused?
You might desperately want to believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the same way you control your actions?
It seems like you can’t just believe whatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face.
Can you control what beliefs you have?
The police have just arrived to arrest your spouse— for murder.
But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.
The question here isn't about what you should do, such as whether or not you should find your spouse guilty in a court of law.
Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence.
Taking the perspective of an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character is a relevant consideration.
Although the evidence against your spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that they’re actually innocent.
It would be incredibly difficult to continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed— or even strongly suspected— was a murderer.
Some pragmatists would even say that you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them.
But is it even possible to believe your spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good for your relationship?
Or because you think you owe it to the accused?
You might desperately want to believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the same way you control your actions?
It seems like you can’t just believe whatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face.
But on the other hand, recall your spouse’s plea.
When we say things like this, we seem to be assuming that it is possible to control our beliefs in some way.
So what do you think?
Can you control what beliefs you have?
And if so, what will you believe about your spouse?
We get it, not everyone loves snakes.
You may not want to encounter one in the wild.
To each their own!
That’s why we’re here, to take you on a world tour of some of nature’s most incredible snakes from the safety of your home— and with your very own intrepid guide.
All the snakes we’ll be visiting belong to a group called the vipers.
As of 2021, there are 368 species of viper worldwide.
The name comes from the term viviparity, which means giving birth to live young.
Unlike most snakes, which lay eggs, most vipers have eggs that hatch inside the mother, who then gives birth to up to dozens of tiny snakes.
Not glad you’re safe at home yet?
Vipers are also often highly venomous, with two hollow fangs that fold flat to the roofs of their mouths.
This allows the fangs to be extra long, unfolding into imposing weapons when the viper prepares to strike.
So how about we pay them a surprise visit?
First stop: the southeastern United States, where we can hear the viper before we can see it.
The eastern diamondback rattlesnake is the largest of 36 species of rattlesnake.
Rattlesnakes can shake their rattles up to 90 times per second to warn off predators for hours if needed.
The rattle consists of hollow, interlocked segments made of keratin, the same substance that makes our nails and hair.
When the snake shakes its tail, these segments hit each other, creating a shockingly loud noise.
Now onto the mountains of western Iran, where a spider crawls across a rock, making easy prey for a passing bird— or not.
The spider-tailed horned viper is perfectly camouflaged, almost invisible, except for its unique bulbous tail-tip with long drooping scales that look like a leggy spider.
Spider-tailed vipers are only about 50 centimeters long, so they can lure small birds within striking range without compromising their ability to squeeze into narrow rock crevices.
In the rainforests of Latin America lives a viper that couldn’t be more different from the spider-tailed viper— if you can find it.
It’s one of the most elusive snakes in the world: the bushmaster.
The bushmaster is a pit viper.
Between each eye and nostril, it has a heat-sensing pit with a membrane covered in highly sensitive receptors that respond to temperature changes as small as one one-thousandth of a degree Celsius.
These pits gather infrared information that is integrated with visual information in the optic tectum. This allows the bushmaster to “see” the heat signature of approaching prey or predators, helping it decide whether or not to strike and strike more accurately.
This comes in handy for guarding a nest— unlike most other vipers, the bushmaster lays eggs in hollowed out tree buttresses or burrows made by other animals.
The African Gaboon viper has the longest fangs of any snake— yes, all 3,879 snake species, not just vipers— and can deliver 1,000 milligrams of venom in a single bite— enough to kill ten adult humans.
Although deadly, Gaboon vipers have a reputation for being slow-moving and placid creatures. When they do strike, they hold onto their rodent prey while the venom takes effect, then quickly swallow it down.
At this point, you may be worrying about our guide— but never fear, rodents like our little desert kangaroo rat have their own skills to evade the serpent’s tooth.
They stomp their feet at rattlesnakes, kick sand towards them, and evade their strikes with acrobatic leaps and powerful kicks— helping them live to guide another snake tour.We get it, not everyone loves snakes.

Adjusting her disguise, Zhu Yingtai prepared to bid her parents goodbye.
She had always been a dutiful daughter— staying home and creating works of embroidery that brought her parents pride.
And yet, although only boys were allowed at the Confucius Academy in Hangzhou, what Yingtai truly wanted was to go to school.
She begged her parents to let her attend dressed as a boy and, seeing her determination and clever disguises, they finally agreed.
However, they only gave her permission when she promised to keep her true identity a secret and eventually return to the traditional path they’d set for her.
Elated, Yingtai began her journey to Hangzhou.
On the way, she found herself at a crossroads, unsure which route to take when a young man approached.
As their eyes met, they shared an instant connection.
Yingtai learned that his name was Liang Shanbo, and that he’d be her classmate at the academy, so they walked the rest of the way together, rapt in conversation.
Yingtai realized that, despite her meticulous disguise, she felt that she could finally be herself.
The two decided to celebrate what they thought would be a long, close friendship, and became sworn brothers.
At the academy, Yingtai buried herself in books and studied with Shanbo late into the nights.
The two felt at home so long as they were at each other’s sides.
They shared a room, but even though Shanbo questioned her about it, Yingtai always used the bathroom alone and buttoned her thick robes up to her chin— no matter the weather.
Now and again, Yingtai heard students muttering about her secretive behavior.
As months slipped into years, Yingtai continued to excel at her studies and felt like her past— and intended future—were lifetimes away.
Yet the whispers grew louder.
And after three years, she had no choice but to leave.
Parting tearfully, Yingtai asked Shanbo to visit her. When Yingtai returned home, her parents announced that the Ma family from the neighboring village had sent a matchmaker to ask their permission for Yingtai to marry their son.
They’d found it a fitting match and accepted.
Trying to hide her disappointment, Yingtai honored their agreement.But as she prepared for another new life, she thought of Shanbo.
Meanwhile, he too was distracted— his studies dull without Yingtai near.
When Shanbo finally visited Yingtai’s house, he came upon a young woman.
He was about to ask for her brother, but as their eyes met, he recognized the young scholar he’d always loved. Shanbo knew he couldn’t stand being separated from Yingtai again and asked her to marry him.
But, heartbroken, Yingtai told him that she was already promised to another.
Shanbo was devastated, but he understood that Yingtai had to abide by her parents’ wishes, and they parted again.
Shanbo fell ill and grew weaker by the day.
Worried, his family sent a matchmaker to the Zhu family.
But, because of Yingtai’s current engagement, her father refused the proposal. Doing otherwise would bring their family public shame.
Shanbo’s Illness took a turn for the worse and, sensing he wouldn’t live to see her married, Shanbo wrote Yingtai a final letter.
If Yingtai loved him, he asked that she burn incense in front of his tomb when she was on her way to the Ma family.
As the procession wound through town under stormy skies, Yingtai broke off and knelt in front of Shanbo’s tomb, lighting incense and offering sacrifices through her tears.

When Yingtai’s wedding day came, it also felt like a funeral.
As the procession wound through town under stormy skies, Yingtai broke off and knelt in front of Shanbo’s tomb, lighting incense and offering sacrifices through her tears.
Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded above and a lightning bolt shot through the tomb, fracturing the stone.
Without hesitation, Yingtai threw herself in.
As her parents rushed to rescue their daughter, two butterflies fluttered out of the crack.
This time, Yingtai had transformed for good.
Finally free, she could float forever with Shanbo at her side.
Emotional abuse can be incredibly damaging, increasing a person’s chances of developing depression and anxiety sometimes for decades after the fact.
Broadly speaking, emotional abuse involves one person controlling another by undermining their sense of self-worth and personal agency.
But emotionally abusive behaviors can be subtle and difficult to spot, both from within and outside the abusive relationship.
That’s partly because emotional abuse often exploits or creates power imbalances between individuals, especially in relationships where safety, care, and trust are supposed to be guaranteed, like the relationship between a caregiver and a child, healthcare provider and patient, teacher and student, or intimate partners.
It’s especially insidious because it often makes people doubt their perceptions of their own mistreatment.
So let’s walk through some of the most common signs of emotional abuse, to make these behaviors and patterns easier to spot in real life.
First, the content of someone’s words: criticism that’s out of proportion to a situation, excessively harsh or personal, or makes sweeping generalizations or baseless negative predictions for the future is a warning sign of emotional abuse.
Statements like, “You always make such stupid decisions,” “You never do anything right,” and “Nobody else will ever love you,” aren’t constructive; they’re never warranted, and someone’s use of them is a red flag.
Second, tone and non-verbal cues: yelling, ignoring and showing contempt through body language are all ways to degrade someone.
These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements that might otherwise seem benign.
It’s common for abusers to try to undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred to as “gaslighting.
Lastly, when someone directs any of these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part of a pattern of behavior from them.
It’s also important to remember that abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm don’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle of emotional manipulation.

Dismissive behaviors like eye rolling, glaring, or refusal to make eye contact, along with refusing to speak to someone or acknowledge their presence— sometimes called “the silent treatment”— can all feature in patterns of emotional abuse.
These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements that might otherwise seem benign.
Third, how someone reacts to being told they’ve said or done something hurtful can give important insight: do they apologize sincerely and act differently in the future, or do they dismiss and minimize the pain they’ve caused?
It’s common for abusers to try to undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred to as “gaslighting.
” Following up demeaning, humiliating, or threatening remarks with comments that dismiss the impact of those remarks, like “I’m just trying to help you improve yourself— you should be grateful,” or “It’s really you that’s selfish and manipulative— you’re&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;hurting me,” are examples of this behavior.
Lastly, when someone directs any of these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part of a pattern of behavior from them.
A one-time incident of name-calling or a demeaning insult might not be emotional abuse, while repetition over time can have a much more serious impact.
Both frequency, how often these behaviors occur in a given period of time, and duration, or how long they last, whether days or years, can contribute to the severity of the abuse.
It’s also important to remember that abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm don’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle of emotional manipulation.
So what can you do if you think you or someone you care about is experiencing emotional abuse?
Maintaining interpersonal ties with people other than the abuser is crucial, as abusers often try to isolate their targets from others close to them. If you think you might be experiencing emotional abuse, consider sharing your experiences with a trusted friend or relative to get outside support.
Or you can seek local or national confidential advocacy centers that can provide helpful resources.
And if you think someone you know is being emotionally abused, check in with them. Let them know you’re thinking of them and that you're ready to listen whenever they'd like to share.
While emotional abusers may convince people that they deserve to be mistreated, nobody does: everyone deserves kindness and respect.
It’s the morning of June 12th, 1944 and a pigeon named Paddy is making an epic 368 kilometer journey.
He manages to dodge Nazi falcons then beats on through stormy weather, flying an average of 79 kilometers per hour for almost five hours straight.
Paddy’s carrying the first news of the D-Day invasion back to England.
He wins a medal for gallantry for this accomplishment.
Paddy was one of around 250,000 pigeons used by the British during World War II to speedily transport secret messages.
In fact, pigeon delivery systems are ancient human practices.
Seeing their meat as a protein source and their nitrogen-rich poop as the perfect fertilizer, humans brought pigeons into captivity as far back as 10,000 years ago.
We then tapped into other traits.
Pigeons are naturally speedy and possess a powerful homing instinct that drives them to navigate long distances back to the location they consider “home.
” So we began developing pigeon posts and breeding and training them for racing.
In a hobby called “pigeon fancying,” people selected for traits like head plumage and fabulously feathered feet.
As we carried pigeons around the world, they escaped or were released, forming the wild urban flocks we're familiar with today.
Pigeons are now one of the most abundant, widespread species on the planet, managing to thrive in chaotic cities.
They owe their success to an ideal combination of traits, including some that were accentuated by humans.
Unlike birds that nest on the ground or in trees, pigeons were originally cliff-dwellers.
City buildings mimic their natural habitat.
And pigeons set a notoriously low bar when it comes to homemaking.
Add some sticks to any window ledge or highway overpass and it's a great spot to raise babies.
This unfussiness allows them to live in environments where more specialized species can’t.
These booming populations attract predators.
They may be numerous, noisy and a little too keen on your lunch, but the pigeons that swirl around us are evidence of an ancient, ongoing relationship.
For better or for worse, we did this to ourselves.It’s the morning of June 12th, 1944 and a pigeon named Paddy is making an epic 368 kilometer journey.

” So we began developing pigeon posts and breeding and training them for racing.
With an organ in their throats called a crop, they can gorge themselves when food is available and store some for later.
They provide “crop milk” to their young instead of having to fetch them live food.
Chicks grow quickly with this fat and protein-rich meal.
If conditions are right, pigeons breed year-round and produce new offspring every six weeks.
They actually have higher breeding rates in cities because of the abundance of food and shelter.
These booming populations attract predators.
New York City is home to a million pigeons, which support large populations of raptors.
But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight, further exploited by being bred for racing, means they’re made for high speed chases.
Compared to barn owls, which are a similar size, pigeon wing bones are thicker and more curved, providing extra space for muscle mass.
They can reach speeds of 125 kilometers per hour.
And their large flocks ensure safety in numbers and more eyes on the lookout.
While pigeons play a starring role in urban wildlife, we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors.
In 1966, New York’s parks commissioner coined the term “rats with wings” and it stuck.
Indeed, their poop, which we originally cherished as fertilizer, presents a unique problem.
Just one pigeon can leave behind 11 kilograms of acidic excrement per year, which, in the United States, scales to about $1.1 billion in structural damage annually.
Though incidents of infection are rare, this poop can host fungi that are harmful to people if inhaled.
They may be numerous, noisy and a little too keen on your lunch, but the pigeons that swirl around us are evidence of an ancient, ongoing relationship.
Their rise to world domination has been a collaborative effort.
For better or for worse, we did this to ourselves.
Around the globe, there are approximately 60 million people who have been forced to leave their homes to escape war, violence, and persecution.
The majority of them have become internally displaced persons, which means they have fled their homes but are still within their own countries.
Others have crossed a border and sought shelter outside of their own countries.
They are commonly referred to as refugees.
But what exactly does that term mean?
The world has known refugees for millennia, but the modern definition was drafted in the UN's 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees in response to mass persecutions and displacements of the Second World War.
It defines a refugee as someone who is outside their country of nationality, and is unable to return to their home country because of well-founded fears of being persecuted.
That persecution may be due to their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, and is often related to war and violence.
Today, roughly half the world's refugees are children, some of them unaccompanied by an adult, a situation that makes them especially vulnerable to child labor or sexual exploitation.
Each refugee's story is different, and many must undergo dangerous journeys with uncertain outcomes.
But before we get to what their journeys involve, let's clear one thing up.
There's a lot of confusion regarding the difference between the terms "migrant" and "refugee.
So what happens when someone flees their country?
Most refugee journeys are long and perilous with limited access to shelter, water, or food.
Since the departure can be sudden and unexpected, belongings might be left behind, and people who are evading conflict often do not have the required documents, like visas, to board airplanes and legally enter other countries.
Financial and political factors can also prevent them from traveling by standard routes.
This means they can usually only travel by land or sea, and may need to entrust their lives to smugglers to help them cross borders.
Whereas some people seek safety with their families, others attempt passage alone and leave their loved ones behind with the hopes of being reunited later.
This separation can be traumatic and unbearably long.
While more than half the world's refugees are in cities, sometimes the first stop for a person fleeing conflict is a refugee camp, usually run by the United Nations Refugee Agency or local governments.
Refugee camps are intended to be temporary structures, offering short-term shelter until inhabitants can safely return home, be integrated to the host country, or resettle in another country.
But resettlement and long-term integration options are often limited.
So many refugees are left with no choice but to remain in camps for years and sometimes even decades.
Once in a new country, the first legal step for a displaced person is to apply for asylum.
At this point, they are an asylum seeker and not officially recognized as a refugee until the application has been accepted.
While countries by and large agree on one definition of refugee, every host country is responsible for examining all requests for asylum and deciding whether applicants can be granted the status of refugee.
Different countries guidelines can vary substantially.
Host countries have several duties towards people they have recognized as refugees, like the guarantee of a minimum standard of treatment and non-discrimination.
The most basic obligation towards refugees is non-refoulement, a principle preventing a nation from sending an individual to a country where their life and freedom are threatened.
In reality, however, refugees are frequently the victims of inconsistent and discriminatory treatment.
They're increasingly obliged to rebuild their lives in the face of xenophobia and racism.
And all too often, they aren't permitted to enter the work force and are fully dependent on humanitarian aid.
In addition, far too many refugee children are out of school due to lack of funding for education programs.
If you go back in your own family history, chances are you will discover that at a certain point, your ancestors were forced from their homes, either escaping a war or fleeing discrimination and persecution.
It would be good of us to remember their stories when we hear of refugees currently displaced, searching for a new home.Around the globe, there are approximately 60 million people who have been forced to leave their homes to escape war, violence, and persecution.
The majority of them have become internally displaced persons, which means they have fled their homes but are still within their own countries.

Since ancient Greece, there have been efforts to control human populations via reproduction, retaining some traits and removing others.
” This wave of modern eugenicists included prominent scientists and progressive reformers who believed they could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits were passed down.
However, their definition of what traits were and were not desirable was largely determined by the prejudices of their era.
Entire categories of people were considered “unfit” for reproduction, including immigrants, people of color and people with disabilities.
Meanwhile, their ideal genetic standard reflected the movement’s members: white Europeans of Nordic or Anglo-Saxon descent.
As the influence of eugenics spread in the early 20th century, many countries restricted immigration and outlawed interracial unions.
These measures to improve so-called “racial hygiene” were taken to their horrific conclusion in Nazi Germany.
The Nazi eugenics campaign systematically killed millions of Jews, as well as individuals from other groups, including Roma, gay men, and people with disabilities.
Outside their extreme brutality, however, Nazi eugenic policies reflected similar standards across the globe.
Throughout the mid-20th century, many countries enacted eugenics policies, and governments in Sweden, Canada, and Japan forcibly sterilized thousands of individuals.
Sterilization was exceptionally common in the US.
From 1907 to 1979, US policies enforced the sterilization of over 60,000 people, with 32 states passing laws that mandated sterilization for men and women deemed “mentally defective.
” This label was typically applied based on superficial mental health diagnoses and the results of IQ tests, which were linguistically and culturally biased against most immigrant populations.
These racist standards were particularly problematic in California.
From 1920 to 1945, Latina women were 59% more likely to be sterilized than other women.
And the rate of sterilizations in California was incredibly high— this single state performed over one third of the country’s sterilization operations.
Such was the case of Andrea Garcia, whose story reflects thousands of individuals with similar fates.
With the help of famed civil rights lawyer David Marcus, Andrea’s mother argued that California’s sterilization law violated the US Constitution, depriving Andrea of her rights to equal protection under the law.
However, while one of the three judges overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea, the other two did not.
Records suggests it’s possible Andrea escaped the impending surgery, but many more victims of these policies did not.
Although eugenics acquired negative connotations after the horrors of World War II, many of its practices, including sterilization, continued for decades.
By the late 1960s, research into human genetics was more nuanced, and bioethics had begun to blunt eugenics’ influence.
Yet Sweden and the US continued to pursue involuntary sterilization well into the 70s.
Andrea Garcia had been accused of skipping school and being sexually promiscuous, so the authorities responsible for juvenile delinquents committed her to a state hospital.
After being administered an IQ test and assigned a low score, the doctors made their verdict.
Since ancient Greece, there have been efforts to control human populations via reproduction, retaining some traits and removing others.
But in the 19th century, the discovery of evolution and genetics inspired a new scientific movement dedicated to this endeavor.
In 1883, British scientist Sir Francis Galton named this idea eugenics, drawn from the Greek word for “to be well born.
” This wave of modern eugenicists included prominent scientists and progressive reformers who believed they could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits were passed down.
However, their definition of what traits were and were not desirable was largely determined by the prejudices of their era.

The grandfather shot the disguised sun god with a blow dart, stunning him. Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird back to health, and soon, he was able to spread his wings and fly again. He transformed back into the sun god and invited the moon goddess to escape with him.
The sun god, Kinich Ahau, was impressed with her work, and admired her from afar.
The grandfather shot the disguised sun god with a blow dart, stunning him. Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird back to health, and soon, he was able to spread his wings and fly again. He transformed back into the sun god and invited the moon goddess to escape with him.
The two rowed away in a canoe, but the grandfather called upon the powerful storm god to help him stop them.
Sensing danger, the moon goddess jumped from the canoe into the water below and transformed into a crab.
But the storm god had already thrown a lightning bolt, which hit the crab and pierced her through her heart, killing her. Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies gathered, buzzing songs and fluttering their transparent wings. They formed a thick, magical cloud over the moon goddess’ body.
For thirteen days the dragonflies cut, cleaned, and hollowed thirteen logs.
On the thirteenth night, the logs burst open, and the moon goddess emerged— alive and more brilliant than ever.
The sun god wasted no time in proposing marriage.
The moon goddess happily agreed.
Side-by-side, they were ready to light up the sky with their powerful rays. Unfortunately, the story doesn’t end there.
The sun god’s brother visited often.
There, she met the king of the vultures.
The vulture king was kind and fun-loving— a much better partner than the violent sun god.
The moon goddess made a new home with him in the mountains. When the sun god heard, he was distraught.
He hid inside a deer carcass until a hungry vulture came swooping down, then hopped onto its back and rode to the mountain kingdom where the moon goddess now lived with the vulture king.
In the mid-1930s, two familiar spires towered above the morning fog.
Stretching 227 meters into the sky, these 22,000-ton towers would help support California’s Golden Gate Bridge.
But since they were currently in Pennsylvania, they first had to be dismantled, packaged, and shipped piece by piece over 4,500 kilometers away.
Moving the bridge’s towers across a continent was just one of the challenges facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the project's lead engineers.
Even before construction began, the pair faced all kinds of opposition.
The military feared the bridge would make the important harbor an even more vulnerable target.
Ferry companies claimed the bridge would steal their business, and residents wanted to preserve the area's natural scenery.
Worse still, many engineers thought the project was impossible.
The Golden Gate Strait was home to 96-kilometer-per-hour winds, swirling tides, an endless blanket of fog, and the earthquake-prone San Andreas fault.
But Strauss was convinced the bridge could be built; and that it would provide San Francisco’s commuters more reliable passage to the city.
He was, however, a bit out of his depth.
This kind of bridge consists of a single beam anchored at one end and extended horizontally like a diving board.
Since these bridges can only extend so far before collapsing under their own weight, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers, linked by a structure in the middle.
The result is a more flexible structure that’s resilient to winds and shifting loads.
This kind of design had long been used for small rope bridges.
At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest suspension bridge ever attempted, and its design was only possible due to these innovations.
Since the strait’s depth prevented them drilling or digging the foundations, bombs were dropped on the ocean floor, creating openings for pouring concrete.
But not even these precautions could prevent an entire scaffolding platform from falling in 1937, carrying ten workers to their deaths.
Consulting architect Irving Morrow actually thought the primer itself paired nicely with the strait’s natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone.

This kind of bridge consists of a single beam anchored at one end and extended horizontally like a diving board.
Since these bridges can only extend so far before collapsing under their own weight, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers, linked by a structure in the middle.
But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif convinced Strauss to pursue a different approach: the suspension bridge.
Where a cantilever bridge is supported from one end a suspension bridge suspends its deck from cables strung across the gap.
The result is a more flexible structure that’s resilient to winds and shifting loads.
This kind of design had long been used for small rope bridges.
And in the 1930s, advanced steel manufacturing could create cables of bundled wire to act as strong steel rope for large-scale construction.
At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest suspension bridge ever attempted, and its design was only possible due to these innovations.
But cables and towers of this size could only be built at large steelworks on the country’s east coast.
While the recently completed Panama Canal made it possible to ship these components to California, reassembling the towers on site didn’t go quite as smoothly.
It was relatively easy to find a stable, shallow foundation for the north tower.
But building the south tower essentially required erecting a ten-story building underwater.
Since the strait’s depth prevented them drilling or digging the foundations, bombs were dropped on the ocean floor, creating openings for pouring concrete.
A seawall was built to protect the site from powerful currents, and workers operated in 20-minute shifts between tides.
The towers had so many compartments that each worker carried a set of plans to prevent getting lost.
And at one point, an earthquake rocked the south tower nearly 5 meters in each direction.
Strauss took worker safety very seriously, requiring hard hats at all times and stretching a safety net below the towers.
But not even these precautions could prevent an entire scaffolding platform from falling in 1937, carrying ten workers to their deaths.
Once the towers were complete, workers spun the cables in place, hung suspenders at 50-foot intervals, and laid down the concrete roadway.
The bridge was finished, but there was still one more task ahead: painting it.
After production, the steel had been coated with a reddish paint primer it maintained throughout construction.
But the Navy had been pushing hard to paint the bridge a tactical black and yellow.
Consulting architect Irving Morrow actually thought the primer itself paired nicely with the strait’s natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone.
Citing numerous letters from locals, Morrow’s 30-page pitch to paint the bridge “international orange” beat out the Navy’s plans.
And today, this iconic color still complements the strait’s blue water, green hills, and rolling fog.
Director: Alright, whenever you’re ready.
Erin Meezan: There's so much debate right now about what companies and countries should be doing on climate.
Nature has 3.8 billion years of R and D under its belt.
So, you know, there's certainly something nature has that maybe humans always don't.
Nature can do complex chemistry, really interesting engineering.
And so how can we look to nature and really harness what we know works to provide solutions for business to be more sustainable?
And so we have opportunities onsite through planting, possibly removal of parking lots, possibly by establishing green roofs, to store carbon on-site and in the buildings within our company.
Capable of flying 35 meters in just 13 seconds, the rocket pack thrilled onlookers.
But the device’s engineers were less enthused.
Despite years of cutting-edge work, they knew this short flight was all the rocket pack could muster. So why was a massive spacecraft easier to send flying than a single pilot?
According to Newton's laws of motion, the physics behind flight are actually quite simple.
All you need is a powerful enough upward force to counteract the downward force of gravity.
And since objects with more mass experience stronger gravitational forces, lighter objects should be easier to get off the ground.
However, modern jet engines, our primary tool for flight, actually get more efficient the larger they are.
Jet engines work by sucking in huge volumes of air, and then expelling that air as quickly as possible.
While most of this actually bypasses the inner machinery, it still contributes to a huge portion of the engine's thrust.
But the air that does enter the engine’s core gets compressed by a series of tightly packed blades.
That compressed air then enters the combustion chamber, where it is injected with jet fuel and ignited.
The heat causes the compressed air to rapidly expand, bursting out of the exhaust and propelling the engine forward.
As air leaves the engine it also turns a turbine embedded in the exhaust nozzle.
This turbine powers the fan and the compressor blades, creating a cycle that maintains thrust for as long as there’s fuel to burn.
The more air an engine can take in and expel the more thrust it can produce.
On a modern jet, the diameter of a frontal fan is larger than a truck.
And even spinning at relatively low speeds, these engines produce more than enough thrust to maintain the necessary speed for flying a passenger aircraft.
But smaller engines simply can’t take in this much air.
For most of the 20th century, engineers couldn’t produce an engine small and light enough for an individual to wear, yet powerful enough to lift itself alongside its pilot and fuel.
Designs could only carry enough fuel for 30 seconds of flight, and when airborne, the powerful thrust in a single direction made jetpacks difficult and dangerous to control.
But the new millennium brought advances in materials, manufacturing, and computing technology, including systems which could manage fuel injection with incredible precision.
Together, these dramatically improved the fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio of jet engines.
By 2016, micro-engines the size of a coffee can and weighing less than 2kg could achieve 220 Newtons of force.
This was when an English engineer named Richard Browning saw the opportunity to create a new kind of lightweight jetpack.
In addition to a single engine strapped to the back, this so-called Jet Suit involved a pair of micro-engines on each arm to split and balance the thrust.
Working with the back engine, these provided three-points of stability, which some pilots describe as being akin to comfortably leaning on crutches while a friend supports your back.
It may seem complicated to manage all these engines at once, but many pilots master it in less than a day with the help of another advanced computer system— their brain.
Various brain regions and multiple sensory systems perfectly calibrate our sense of balance and spatial orientation, helping pilots smoothly direct their flights.
Slight movements of the arms allow operators to increase and decrease lift, quickly turn in mid-air, or glide forward for up to 5 minutes.
This technology is still fairly new, and without major advances in fuel efficiency and engine technology, don’t expect to have a jetpack of your own any time soon.
But if reaching for the sky already got us this far, who knows where we'll fly next?On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin piloted a 2,400 kilogram spacecraft in humanity’s first manned space flight.
One week later, Bell Aerosystems debuted another advancement in aviation: the gas-powered rocket pack.
Capable of flying 35 meters in just 13 seconds, the rocket pack thrilled onlookers.
But the device’s engineers were less enthused.

And yet, not one of almost 4,000 women who participated in the contest matched Norma, the supposedly “normal” woman.
Applied to individuals, whether someone is considered normal usually depends on how closely they hew to this average.
At best, such definitions of normal fail to capture variation.
But oftentimes, our calculations of normal are even more flawed.
Take the BMI— or Body Mass Index.
BMI is a measure of weight relative to height, with different ratios falling into “underweight,” “normal weight,” “overweight,” and “obese” ranges.
Generally, only BMIs that correspond to normal weight are considered healthy.
But BMI is not always an accurate predictor of health, or even of what’s a healthy weight.
BMI doesn’t take into account body fat percentage, body fat distribution, levels of physical activity, or blood pressure.
And yet, those who fall outside the so-called normal range are commonly advised that losing or gaining weight will improve their health.
When we apply a standard of normal to all of humanity that’s based on data from a non-representative slice, we’re not just choosing one point on the distribution, we’re choosing it from the wrong distribution.
A lot of behavior science research draws from samples that are pretty WEIRD— meaning Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic.
These features can skew norms even in research that doesn’t have an obvious link to them.
Take the famed Muller-Lyer optical illusion: it’s normal to think one of the two lines is longer, when they’re actually the same length.
At least, it is if you’re an American undergraduate.
A team of anthropologists and psychologists found other demographic groups were much less susceptible— members of the San people of the Kalahari weren’t susceptible to the illusion at all.
When these limited or inaccurate definitions of normal are used to make decisions that impact people’s lives, they can do real harm.
Historically, such concepts of normal have been hugely influential.
The Eugenics Movement of the early 20th century weaponized the concept of normal, using it to justify exclusion, violence, and even extermination of those deemed not normal.
To this day, people are often targeted and discriminated against on the basis of disabilities, mental health issues, sexual orientations, gender identities, and other features deemed “not normal.
Based on measurements taken from tens of thousands of young men and women, they were called Norma and Normman.
That same year, a contest launched to find a living embodiment of Norma.
Normal is often used as a synonym for “typical,” “expected,” or even “correct. ” By that logic, most people should fit the description of normal.
And yet, not one of almost 4,000 women who participated in the contest matched Norma, the supposedly “normal” woman.
This puzzle isn’t unique to Norma and Normman, either— time and time again, so-called normal descriptions of our bodies, minds, and perceptions have turned out to match almost no one.
And yet, a lot of the world is constructed around a foundation of normalcy.
So what does normal actually mean— and should we be relying on it so much?
In statistics, a normal distribution describes a set of values that fall along a bell curve.
The average, or mean, of all the values is at the very center, and most other values fall within the hump of the bell.
These curves can be tall, with most values inside a narrow range, or long and flat, with only a slight bias towards the average.
What makes the distribution normal is that it follows this curved shape.
Many human traits, like height, follow a normal distribution.
BMI is a measure of weight relative to height, with different ratios falling into “underweight,” “normal weight,” “overweight,” and “obese” ranges.
BMI doesn’t take into account body fat percentage, body fat distribution, levels of physical activity, or blood pressure.
And yet, those who fall outside the so-called normal range are commonly advised that losing or gaining weight will improve their health.
A lot of behavior science research draws from samples that are pretty WEIRD— meaning Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic.
Take the famed Muller-Lyer optical illusion: it’s normal to think one of the two lines is longer, when they’re actually the same length.
He believes it is a state’s right to choose whether or not to allow slavery.
He doesn’t think the federal government can prohibit slavery in any newly added states.
” Whaaaaat?
“Senator Thomas proposes what he sees as a compromise: Missouri will join the union along with another state, Maine.
Slavery will be allowed in Missouri and prohibited in Maine.
He also suggests drawing a line through territories yet to become states: slavery will be prohibited north of the line, and allowed south of it.
” And this is where &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; have to draw the line.
That’s better.
Now, senators, congressmen, this Missouri compromise you are proposing is fundamentally flawed— flawed is putting it mildly.
The compromise is based on the middle ground fallacy.
By saying that half of the new territories should allow slavery while half prohibit it, you position the two viewpoints, pro-slavery and anti-slavery, as equally valid.
But if one view is wrong, while the other is right, a compromise between them is still wrong.
And one side is definitely wrong here: the pro-slavery side.
The whole reason this government exists, the whole reason states exist at all, is to serve the people.
That should include all people.
Now, I know there are those among you who would argue otherwise, even among those in favor of ending slavery.
In response to your many contorted arguments, all of them wrong, I offer this reminder: the idea that slavery is morally indefensible is not new to you.
The founders of your country knew it and many even acknowledged it publicly, even those of them who enslaved other people themselves.
It’s clear that the errors and delusions on this subject go far beyond the middle ground fallacy, but I call your attention to this particular fallacy because it can have dire consequences in many situations.
Failure to recognize the fact that a compromise between two positions, one of which is morally indefensible, is also morally indefensible, has helped to perpetuate countless injustices large and small.
Even well-intentioned people— which rest assured, I don’t mistake you for— fall prey to this fallacy, because you humans tend to view compromise as a virtue unto itself.
“It’s March 1861. Seven states have seceded from the Union since Abraham Lincoln was elected president.
As Lincoln takes office with four more states threatening to leave, he promises not to interfere with slavery in states where it exists, but to prohibit its expansion into new territories and states.
” “It’s April 1861, and a Civil War has broken out over slavery.
” Some things can't be resolved with a compromise.What, you want my milkshake? Here. “It’s 1819. As the United States Congress prepares to make Missouri the 24th state in the Union, Representative James Tallmage Jr.
delivers a speech.
He says slavery is morally wrong, calling it an ‘abomination’ and a ‘monstrous scourge.
’ He insists that ‘the extension of the evil must now be prevented,’ and that slavery shouldn’t be allowed in Missouri, or any new state.
” Obviously.
“Representative Tyler disagrees.
He believes it is a state’s right to choose whether or not to allow slavery.
He doesn’t think the federal government can prohibit slavery in any newly added states.
” Whaaaaat?
“Senator Thomas proposes what he sees as a compromise: Missouri will join the union along with another state, Maine.
Slavery will be allowed in Missouri and prohibited in Maine.
He also suggests drawing a line through territories yet to become states: slavery will be prohibited north of the line, and allowed south of it.
” And this is where &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; have to draw the line.
That’s better.
The compromise is based on the middle ground fallacy.

He’s older than 1, but beyond that, he looks timeless. You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200. The birthday boy is a giant, and you're afraid that if your forgetfulness becomes known, you'll become part of the feast.
You aren’t carrying anything with you, and any marks you make will disappear.
How can you count the candles?
If you walk forward, you’ll eventually find another lit candle— either a new one or you’re starting one.
If the starting candle is now off, you’ve completed the loop and know the giant’s age! Otherwise, depart again, continuing until the next lit candle, testing if it’s your starting one and so on.
This will work. . . eventually. But if the giant isn’t young, and many candles are on, you might have a marathon to run between now and sunrise.
And you definitely don’t want to be in the cake when he starts digging in.
So let’s look for a more efficient solution.
How about testing a series of hypotheses about the giant's age?
Suppose you guess he’s turning 10. You could light the starting candle, walk forward 10, switch or leave the destination candle off, and return.
If the starting candle’s still on, 10 isn’t the answer.
If it’s off, 10 could be right, but you may have made multiple loops— so 10′s factors 5 and 2 are also possibilities.
Then you would have passed a repeating pattern— but that could have just been the starting arrangement. So what if you changed the candles on the way?
If you turned them all on while walking from candle 1 to 11, switch that off, then turn back, the first unlit candle you find would tell you the exact candle count.
And if you don't hit any extinguished candles, you'll know that the total must be higher than 10. You could then pick a larger guess and try again.
To be systematic, you could increase your guess by the same number each time, say 4. If there were 99 candles, this method would take 24 roundtrips and involve visiting nearly 2,700 candles.
But you don’t have to increase your guess linearly. For instance, you could double it, from 10 to 20 to 40, and discover the true number on your 5th trip after around 560 candles.
He’s older than 1, but beyond that, he looks timeless. You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200. The birthday boy is a giant, and you're afraid that if your forgetfulness becomes known, you'll become part of the feast.
The baker has meticulously prepared a small mountain range of a cake, and your job is to sculpt the giant’s age as the chocolate centerpiece.
You would love to just count the candles on the cake, but you're much too small to see the top of it.
Then you remember: the baker made an interior tunnel to activate the candles from below.
Some are currently on, and others off, in no discernible pattern.
The tunnel is a single loop, and in the dark you can’t tell its shape or size.
You aren’t carrying anything with you, and any marks you make will disappear.
You need a strategy.
How can you count the candles?
Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are a few ways to solve this problem.
Let's start with the most straightforward.
There’s exactly one way to mark a location in the tunnel: the state of the candle.
You can mark the first candle you reach by lighting it or keeping it on.
If you walk forward, you’ll eventually find another lit candle— either a new one or you’re starting one.
The question is: how could you know which?
Here’s one approach: turn it off and backtrack to the start by passing the same number of candles you passed on the way there.
If the starting candle is now off, you’ve completed the loop and know the giant’s age! Otherwise, depart again, continuing until the next lit candle, testing if it’s your starting one and so on.
This will work. . . eventually. But if the giant isn’t young, and many candles are on, you might have a marathon to run between now and sunrise.
And you definitely don’t want to be in the cake when he starts digging in.
So let’s look for a more efficient solution.

Imagine that you’ve been unemployed and seeking work for months.
Finally, you hear back about a job application.
Somehow, you have less money now than when you were unemployed.
Poverty traps are economic and environmental circumstances that reinforce themselves, perpetuating poverty for generations.
If those in poverty know they'll gain no net benefit from working, they're incentivized to remain in government assistance.
Some have suggested this feedback loop could be removed by eliminating government assistance programs altogether.
But most agree the solution is neither realistic nor humane.
So how can we redesign benefits in a way that doesn't penalize people for working?
Many countries have tried different ways to circumvent this problem.
Some allow people to continue receiving benefits for a given period after finding a job, while others phase out benefits gradually as income increases.
These policies still remove some financial incentive to work, but the risk of a welfare trap is lower.
Other governments provide benefits like education, childcare, or medical care equally across all their citizens.
One proposed solution takes this idea of universal benefits even further.
A universal basic income would provide a fixed benefit to all members of society, regardless of wealth or employment status.
This is the only known policy that could entirely remove welfare traps, since any earned wages would supplement the benefit rather than replace it.
In fact, by creating a stable income floor below which no one can fall, basic income might prevent people from falling into poverty in the first place.
Numerous economists and thinkers have championed this idea since the 18th century.
But for now, universal basic income remains largely hypothetical.
Although it's been tried in some places on a limited scale, these local experiments don’t tell us much about how the policy would play out across an entire nation— or a planet.
Whatever strategy governments pursue, solving the welfare trap requires respecting people’s agency and autonomy.
Only by empowering individuals to create long-term change in their lives and communities can we begin to break the cycle of poverty.Imagine that you’ve been unemployed and seeking work for months.
Government benefit programs have helped you cover rent, utilities, and food, but you're barely getting by.
Finally, you hear back about a job application.
You receive your first paycheck in months, and things seem to be turning around.
But there’s a catch.
Your new job pays just enough to disqualify you from the benefit programs, and not enough to cover the same costs.
To make things worse, you have to pay for transportation to work, and childcare while you’re at the office.
Somehow, you have less money now than when you were unemployed.
Economists call this demoralizing situation the welfare trap— one of the many different poverty traps affecting millions of people around the world.
Poverty traps are economic and environmental circumstances that reinforce themselves, perpetuating poverty for generations.
Some poverty traps are tied to an individual’s circumstances, like a lack of access to healthy food or education.
Others can affect entire nations, such as cycles of corrupt government or climate change.
But the cruel irony of welfare traps in particular is that they stem from the very policies designed to battle poverty.
Most societies throughout history employed some strategies to help people in poverty meet basic needs.
Before the 20th century, religious groups and private charities often led such initiatives.
Today, these are called welfare programs, and they usually take the form of government-provided subsidies for housing, food, energy, and healthcare.
Typically, these programs are means-tested, meaning that only people who fall below a certain income level are eligible for benefits.
This policy is designed to ensure aid goes to those who need it most.
But it also means people lose access as soon as they earn more than the qualification threshold, regardless of whether or not they're financially stable enough to stay there.
This vicious cycle is harmful to both those in poverty and those outside of it.
Mainstream economic models assume people are rational actors who weigh the cost and benefits of their options and choose the most advantageous path forward.
If those in poverty know they'll gain no net benefit from working, they're incentivized to remain in government assistance.
Of course, people work for many reasons, including societal norms and personal values. But income is a major incentive to pursuing employment.
And when less people take on new jobs, the economy slows down, keeping people in poverty and potentially pushing people on the cusp of poverty over the edge.

At just 12 years old, I witnessed the devastating impact pollution was having on Iran, my parents' home country.
On one of my summer visits, I witnessed smog so heavy it completely blanketed the air, obscuring the stars I wanted to trace out of the night sky.
I decided to read more about climate change in Iran, and I became increasingly alarmed, particularly when I learned the fact that temperatures in the Middle East were rising more than twice the global average. Armed with this knowledge, I decided to confront my relatives.
But I was shocked when they informed me that they knew almost nothing about climate change.
So I began to dig into the lack of climate education in Iran, and I found a study that read only five percent of Iranian students could properly explain the greenhouse gas effect.
As I continued to scour the internet for more information, I began to connect the dots.
From what I could see, there was a severe lack of climate resources available in Farsi, Iran's native language.
Now, I was still determined to educate my relatives, so I decided to work with my mom to translate climate resources into Farsi so I could teach my aunts and uncles about how climate-change-induced disasters were impacting millions of Iranians.
As I watched my relatives read my translations, I had never been happier to see fear plastered all over their faces -- (Laughter) because reading my translations had succeeded in convincing them that climate change was a real and pressing threat.
Now, my story is anecdotal.
But the fact that the vast majority of scientific research is only available in English is a big problem when it comes to climate change . . . (Applause) because most people in the world don't speak English.
In fact, 75 percent of them do not speak English at all.
Yet, according to a 2012 study on Scopus, the world's largest database for peer-reviewed journals, 80 percent of articles are written entirely in English.
Even the United Nations' IPCC report, widely regarded as one of the most renowned pieces of climate literature in the world, is only officially available in the six UN languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.
But these are languages that account for less than half of the world's speaking population.
Meaning, the majority of people on our planet are unable to understand the documents and agreements being issued by the world's highest international political body. This lack of easily accessible documents and resources leads to misinformation and low public interest around tackling issues such as climate change.
In fact, just six years ago, 40 percent of adults in the world had never heard of climate change.
Let me repeat that. Two out of five adults had never heard of climate change.
When looking at specific regions where this problem lies, we can see that multiple studies have found, in Africa, there was a severe lack of climate education and curriculum available in Africa’s Indigenous and local languages.
This lack of information only hurts those who need access to it the most.
In countries such as Japan and the Philippines, climate change has worsened typhoons and disrupted agricultural industries.
In these and the other 10 countries worst impacted by climate change, only one, Canada, is a majority English-speaking.
Languages remain a significant barrier to the global transfer of scientific knowledge -- be it through the press, through schools or through political processes.
If a ragtag group of teenagers that congregate through social media can do this work, imagine the impact that a concentrated effort by governments, scientists and policymakers would have.
Groups of people that are being disproportionately affected by climate change deserve to have access to the resources they need to make sense of these disasters that are destroying their communities.
(Cheers and applause) The more people are informed about the climate crisis, the greater chance we have to coordinate collective efforts in protection of the future of our planet. Because every single person in the world, every single person in this room, has the power to further climate action.
So we must engage people from every country, young and old, to join the fight for climate justice.
English cannot be the barrier to entry.
Thank you.

Over his lifetime, Leonardo conducted groundbreaking studies on human optics, which led him to pioneer certain artistic techniques.
King François the First of France purchased the painting and began displaying it after Leonardo’s death. Then, in 1550, Italian scholar Giorgio Vasari published a popular biography of Italian Renaissance artists, Leonardo included.
” A year later, Théophile Gautier wrote of her “mocking lips” and “gaze promising unknown pleasures.
” And in 1869, Walter Pater described Mona Lisa as the embodiment of timeless feminine beauty.
It was Peruggia’s 1911 heist that helped it skyrocket to unprecedented fame.
Having been contracted to make protective cases for the Louvre, it wasn’t totally inconceivable for Peruggia to be locked inside the museum.
And, lucky for him, when a workman encountered him in the stairwell, he simply helped Peruggia open the door and let him walk out into the morning.
The theft made international headlines.
People gathered to see the blank space where the “Mona Lisa” once hung. The police interviewed Peruggia because he had worked at the Louvre, but they never considered him a suspect.
Meanwhile, they interrogated Pablo Picasso because of his connection to a previous Louvre theft, but eventually let him go.
For two years, Peruggia kept the painting in a false-bottom suitcase, then smuggled the “Mona Lisa” to Italy and arranged to sell it to a Florentine art dealer.
Peruggia saw himself as an Italian patriot returning an old master’s work.
But instead of being celebrated as such, he was immediately arrested.
With the mystery solved, the “Mona Lisa” went back on display to large crowds, and newspapers took the story for a victory lap.
In the following decades, conceptual artist Marcel Duchamp mocked it; Nazi art thieves pursued it; Nat King Cole sang about it; and museumgoers wielding stones, paint, acid, and teacups attacked it.
More than 500 years after its creation— eyebrows and eyelashes long since faded— the “Mona Lisa” is protected by a bulletproof, earthquake-safe case.
Tucked under Peruggia’s arm was Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.
” It's arguably the world's most famous painting today. But how did it achieve its status?
Leonardo is thought to have started the portrait in 1503 at the request of a Florentine businessman who wanted a portrait of his wife, Lisa Gherardini.
Over his lifetime, Leonardo conducted groundbreaking studies on human optics, which led him to pioneer certain artistic techniques.
During the 1800s, a series of European scholars further hyped the “Mona Lisa” up, fixating to a conspicuous degree on the subject's allure.
” And in 1869, Walter Pater described Mona Lisa as the embodiment of timeless feminine beauty.
By the 20th century, the portrait was an iconic piece in one of the world’s most famous museums.
But the “Mona Lisa” wasn’t yet a household name.
It was Peruggia’s 1911 heist that helped it skyrocket to unprecedented fame.
Having been contracted to make protective cases for the Louvre, it wasn’t totally inconceivable for Peruggia to be locked inside the museum.

You are the captain of the Mallory 7, an interstellar cargo transport.
On your way to the New Lindley spaceport, you receive a distress call.
There’s been an explosion on the Telic 12 and its passengers are running out of oxygen.
As you set a course to intercept, you check the Telic 12′s manifest.
It’s currently transporting 30 middle-aged individuals from some of Earth’s poorest districts to the labor center on New Lindley, where they'll be assigned jobs on the spaceport.
But as you approach the Telic 12, you receive a second distress call.
A luxury space cruiser called the Pareto has lost a thruster, sending them careening towards an asteroid belt.
Without your help, the 20 college students headed for vacation aboard the Pareto are all doomed.
So with only enough time to save one ship, which one should you choose?
This dilemma is an example of a broader class of problems where a life-saving resource— such as a donated organ or vaccine— is scarce.
There are many schools of thought on how to approach these problems, and one of the most influential is utilitarianism, an ethical view first systematically developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.
In this view, you should choose the action which promises the greatest sum of happiness.
Though, how to define and measure happiness is a difficult question.
For example, hedonists would suggest a happy life contains the most pleasure and the least pain.
Others might say it’s the life where your desires are most fulfilled.
However happiness is defined, most would agree that saving 30 lives has the potential to generate more happiness than saving 20. But is it enough to consider how many lives would be saved?
So perhaps saving the smaller ship actually has the potential to generate the most happiness.
If all these calculations feel a bit cold, you may want to consider a different approach.
The philosopher Derek Parfit argues we should give priority to the worse off, since benefits to those groups matter more than equivalent benefits to the well-off.
In this view, it’s more urgent to help those whose basic needs aren’t met even if they’re harder to help than those who are flourishing.
But often, determining which group is truly worse off can get complicated fast.
In our case, Earth is still beset by drastic inequalities in wealth and opportunity.
And those able to afford a vacation on New Lindley and transport on a luxury cruiser are no doubt among the most well-off people on the planet.
The workers, by contrast, are among the most disadvantaged, traveling away from home for months at a time to perform service work.
With fewer resources and opportunities, it’s likely they’ve experienced more hardship in their lives than the vacationers, so maybe they’re more deserving of rescue?
On the other hand, the students have experienced less life overall— so perhaps they’re worse off?
Or maybe none of these variables should influence our decision.
The philosopher John Taurek famously argued that in these types of cases, the numbers don’t count.
Each person is deserving of equal concern and respect, so the best way to decide which passengers to save is to flip a coin.
While this might seem arbitrary at first, this approach treats all parties equally, giving each individual an equal chance of being rescued.
Could any passenger argue that they're being treated unfairly by a coin flip?
It’s tough to say.

Between 1927 and 1941, 400 workers blasted 450,000 tons of rock from a mountainside using chisels, jackhammers, and a lot of dynamite.
Gradually, they carved out Mount Rushmore.
Now, the monument draws nearly 3 million people to South Dakota’s Black Hills every year.
But its façade belies a dark history.
About 10,000 years ago, Native American people began inhabiting the Black Hills.
The area became especially sacred to the Lakota people, who formed the western branch of what the US called the Sioux Nation.
The Lakota believed one cave within the Black Hills to be where they first emerged.
And they named one of the Black Hills mountain peaks the Six Grandfathers after their sacred directional spirits.
But in the 1800s, Lakota access to this land came under threat.
White settlers in North America expanded their territories by using physical violence or negotiating with Indigenous peoples.
After its establishment in the late 1700s, the US government ratified hundreds of treaties with Native American nations.
However, it often broke them or created them using coercion.
Between 1866 in 1868, the Lakota and their allies successfully defended their land from the U. S. military and negotiated a new treaty with the government.
In the 1868 Treaty at Fort Laramie, all parties agreed that a vast territory, including the Black Hills, belonged to the Sioux Nation.
In return, the Lakota would allow US travelers to pass safely through.
But many aspects of the Treaty also aimed to assimilate the Lakota into white culture.
This included incentives to convert them from hunting to farming, abandon their nomadic lifestyle, and wear clothes the US provided.
Meanwhile, just seven years later, the US broke the treaty after an expedition found gold in the Black Hills.
Miners set up camps, the military attacked and ultimately defeated the Lakota, and the US passed legislation illegally seizing the land.
50 years later, workers began etching into the Lakota’s sacred Six Grandfather’s Mountain.
The project was led by an arrogant sculptor named Gutzon Borglum, who had ties to the KKK.
A historian originally proposed that Mount Rushmore include Western figures— like Lakota Chief Red Cloud.
But Borglum chose to feature his own heroes.
By October of 1941, Borglum had died from surgical complications and work stopped, though the project was unfinished.
None of the four figures had torsos, as intended, and rubble was left piled below.
To the Lakota, the monument was a desecration.
And the presidents immortalized on the rockface all had brutal anti-Indigenous legacies.
The amount named has since reached over a billion dollars.
But the Sioux Nation refused to take the money and to give up their claim to the Black Hills, maintaining that they were never for sale.
So, what should happen to Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills?
Responses to that question are wide-ranging.
Some, including tribal leaders and Borglum’s great-granddaughter, have called for Mount Rushmore to be removed.
Others see it as an important patriotic symbol and vital aspect of South Dakota's economy that should remain.
Many Lakota people want the 1868 Treaty to be honored and the now-federally controlled lands to be returned to their tribal communities.
Others have said that the Lakota and the US should at least co-manage parts of the Black Hills.
Native people have been fighting for broken treaties to be honoured for generations, achieving some major victories along the way.
Meanwhile, if untouched, the faces engraved on the Six Grandfathers Mountain are expected to remain for thousands of years to come.
Insomnia is when you consistently have difficulties either falling asleep, difficulties staying asleep or you just don’t feel refreshed or restored by your sleep the next day.
Now, when sleep becomes difficult, there are many things that people understandably turn to for help, but not all of them work especially well.
[Sleeping with Science] For instance alcohol and THC, which is the psychoactive component of cannabis, are all popular options.
However, both THC and alcohol will ultimately make your insomnia and your sleep difficulties worse, rather than better.
Even melatonin will only increase your sleep quality, or what we call your sleep efficiency, by just a few percent.
And there are now many studies that have shown CBTI to be just as effective as sleeping pills in the short term.
Yet CBTI has no negative side effects, unlike sleeping pills.
In addition, after you stop working with your therapist, the sleep benefits can last for years later.
CBTI is now, in fact, so powerful that it is our first-line recommended treatment for insomnia, and it allows you to regain your confidence in the ability to sleep well each and every night.
During the 17th century, the three letters “VOC” formed the world’s most recognizable logo.
These initials belonged to the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or the Dutch East India Company— widely considered the most profitable corporation ever created.
Starting in 1602, it cornered the booming spice market and pioneered trade routes between Asia and Europe.
But such success came with an overwhelming cost in human life.
When the Dutch state created the Company, it granted the organization the power to wage war, conduct diplomacy, and seize colonies throughout Asia.
The Dutch East India Company was intended to make money and battle competing European empires.
The Asian market was the largest at the time and spices were in great demand throughout Europe.
Nutmeg was among the most precious.
But it was only cultivated on Indonesia’s Banda Islands.
If Dutch officials could seize exclusive control over nutmeg, they'd make their investors rich, ensure the Company’s long-term survival and deprive their adversaries of the same gains.
However, their plan hinged on the submission of the Bandanese people.
This was something Company officials, like the ruthless Jan Pieterszoon Coen, were willing to go to great lengths to ensure.
Home to around 15,000 people, the Banda Islands were composed of village confederations controlled by rich men called orang kaya, who were expert traders.
They'd retained their virtual monopoly over nutmeg for centuries, selling at the highest price to Asian and European merchants.
When the Dutch East India Company arrived in the early 1600s, its officials persuaded a group of orang kaya to sign a treaty.
It guaranteed protection in exchange for monopoly rights to their nutmeg.
Bandanese leaders had made similar agreements before, but were able to break them without serious consequences.
The Dutch represented a new threat.
They attempted to build forts to control trade and stop smuggling, and insisted that all nutmeg be sold to them at deflated prices.
Many Bandanese refused and relations continued to deteriorate.
In 1609, a group of villagers ambushed and killed a Dutch admiral and 40 of his men.
Over the next decade, tensions escalated as treaties were broken and re-signed.
The Company and Jan Pieterszoon Coen, its Governor-General, began considering new strategies.
The Bandanese, one official wrote, should be “brought to reason or entirely exterminated.
” Coen himself believed that there could be no trade without war.
Soon, Dutch officials claimed they'd detected a conspiracy against them.
Coen used this to eliminate further resistance.
He ordered his soldiers to torture Bandanese leaders to extract confessions.
Over the following months, Company troops waged a brutal campaign that decimated the population.
Many Bandanese people were starved to death or enslaved and sent to distant Dutch colonies.
Others jumped from cliffs rather than surrender.
Thousands fled, emptying out whole villages.
Some survivors resettled on other islands, where they preserved remnants of Bandanese language and culture.
When the Company’s violent campaign was over, the indigenous population had plummeted to less than a thousand, most of whom were enslaved.
The Dutch East India Company sliced the islands into plantations and imported an enslaved workforce.
It was, by many measures, an act of genocide.
By securing this global monopoly over nutmeg, the Company supercharged its economic development, contributing to the Dutch Golden Age.
Although Coen faced criticism, he was celebrated as a national hero well into the 20th century.
400 years after the massacre on Banda, Coen’s statue still stands in the city of Hoorn— despite mounting pressure for its removal.
Coen and the Dutch East India Company brought a prized commodity under their control and profits soared.
But they achieved this by violently tearing another society apart.During the 17th century, the three letters “VOC” formed the world’s most recognizable logo.

Can a lack of sleep lead to unnecessary weight gain?
Unfortunately, that’s what the scientific evidence tells us.
[Sleeping with Science] Part of the reason is due to an imbalance in two key appetite-regulating hormones called leptin and ghrelin.
Now, leptin sends a signal of fullness to your brain, so you feel satiated by your food.
Ghrelin, on the other hand, does the opposite.
It sends a signal of hunger to your brain.
And sadly, these two hormones will go in opposite directions when we’re not getting enough sleep.
Specifically, a lack of sleep will decrease levels of leptin, so you won’t feel as satisfied by your meals; you won’t feel full.
And if that weren't bad enough, levels of ghrelin will actually increase when you’re not getting sufficient sleep, so you’ll constantly feel hungry and you’ll want to eat more.
However, it's not just that you want to eat more when sleep gets short.
It’s also about a change in what you want to eat.
In particular, a lack of sleep will shift your preferences towards desiring higher-calorie and sugary carbohydrate foods.
What’s fascinating is that this relationship between sleep and food is a two-way street.
We’ve discovered that eating to excess, and also eating a diet that contains high amounts of sugar and low amounts of fiber, are all associated with significantly worse sleep quantity and sleep quality.
The good news here is that we can think of sleep as a new tool to help regulate our body weight.
And as a result, improve our overall health and our wellness.Can a lack of sleep lead to unnecessary weight gain?

Versions of this stereotype emerged in the mid-20th century to describe Chinese Americans.
But following World War II, the label became commonly used to claim that Japanese Americans had overcome their mistreatment in US incarceration camps, and successfully integrated into American society.
Former incarcerees were praised as compliant, diligent, and respectful of authority.
In the following decades, “model minority” became a label for many Asian populations in the US.
But the truth behind this story of thriving Asian Americans is much more complicated.
During World War II, the US government tried to “Americanize” incarcerated Japanese Americans.
They did this through English language classes, patriotic exercises, and lessons on how to behave in white American society.
When incarcerees were released, they were instructed to avoid returning to their own communities and cultural practices, and instead, integrate into white society.
But after decades of anti-Asian policies and propaganda, white Americans had to be persuaded that Japanese Americans were no longer a threat.
So the government organized media coverage to transform the public perception of Japanese Americans from suspected traitors to an American success story.
In fact, the phrase “model minority” was coined by one such article from 1966. But this article, and others like it, didn’t just cast Asian Americans as an obedient and respectful “model minority. " They also criticized so-called “problem minorities,” primarily Black Americans.
Politicians who were threatened by the rising Civil Rights movement used this rhetoric to discredit Black Americans’ demands for justice and equality.
They presented a fabricated story of Asian American success to paint struggling Black communities as inferior.
This narrative put a wedge between Black and Asian Americans.
It erased their shared history of fighting oppression alongside other marginalized groups, and pit the two communities against each other.
In doing so, the model minority myth also enforced a racial hierarchy, with white Americans on top and everyone else underneath.
Certainly, many people who still believe the model minority stereotype, either consciously or unconsciously, might not agree with that idea.
But comparing the imagined strengths and weaknesses of racial groups places value on how well those groups meet certain standards— typically, standards set by a white majority.
In this case, the model minority stereotype suggests that marginalized groups who are compliant, gentle, and respectful of white authority are deserving of tolerance, while groups that challenge the status quo are not.
This stereotype also negatively impacts the Asian individuals it describes.
According to a psychological phenomenon known as stereotype threat, members of a group often place pressure on their individual actions to avoid encouraging negative group stereotypes.
But this phenomenon can occur around seemingly positive stereotypes as well.
The pressure associated with living up to impossibly high standards can lead to poor performance.
And teachers are less likely to notice when Asian students are struggling. Outside the classroom, social programs catering to Asian communities are frequently overlooked or cut, because they’re assumed to need less support than other disadvantaged groups.
The favorable portrait created by this stereotype can also make it harder to recognize racially motivated violence and discrimination against Asian Americans.
And since this stereotype carelessly groups all Asians under the same umbrella, it impacts people with various backgrounds and unique histories of discrimination.
So while the model minority label might appear to benefit Asian populations at first, in practice, it works like every other racial stereotype.
It reduces a group of people to a one-dimensional image.
And that single image hinders our ability to understand the history, struggles, and triumphs of the individuals within that group.
Melatonin is a hormone, often called the hormone of darkness, simply because melatonin tells your brain and your body that it's nighttime and that it's time to sleep.
Melatonin is naturally produced by your brain, and it's released by a very small gland deep within your brain, called the pineal gland.
However, you can also buy melatonin in certain countries, and some people will try to use it as a sleep aid.
But melatonin isn't quite as effective as you may think.
And this is very understandable, since the role of melatonin is primarily in regulating the timing of your sleep, rather than being involved in the generation of sleep itself.
That's down to a very different set of brain mechanisms.
It's also important to understand that melatonin is not well regulated as a supplement in several countries.
As a result, the purity and the strength of melatonin that you buy is often unreliable.
So if you're looking to optimize your sleep, it's best to focus on the basics.
The things that we know make a real difference, things such as regularity, keeping your bedroom cool at night, getting darkness in the evening, for example, trying to dim down half of the lights in your house in the last hour before bed.
And then, reverse-engineering this by getting plenty of natural daylight in the morning hours.
And finally try to get some form of physical activity each day.
These things are much more likely to help your sleep, rather than looking to melatonin for some kind of sleep assistance.
The first pairs of jeans were designed for durability.
Named for the French city of Nîmes, denim was constructed as a sturdy cotton weave worn by sailors.
This rugged material got even stronger in the 19th century, when Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis added metal rivets to reinforce stress points.
Their design introduced a new brand of durable trousers for California miners that could withstand years of wear and tear.
Today, most pairs last no longer than a year.
And each new pair you buy has a much higher cost than you might think.
Every pair of jeans begins its life in a cotton field.
It takes about 0.7 kilograms of cotton to produce a single pair of pants.
Growing this much cotton requires roughly 10,000 liters of water, not to mention various herbicides and pesticides, which can contaminate groundwater. The cotton is harvested by hand or industrial machines and transported to textile factories where it’s spun into yarn.
At this point, it’s typically combined with plastic fibers like spandex to increase the yarn’s elasticity.
These plastic threads make modern jeans more comfortable and flexible, but also much less durable.
Next, the yarn is dyed jeans’ trademark blue.
Historically, this color came from natural plant-derived indigo.
But most modern manufacturers use a synthetic dye made from petroleum byproducts and toxic chemicals.
Once dyed, the cotton-plastic blend is woven into denim sheets, which are then cut and sewn into jeans.
After assembly, some jeans undergo additional procedures to get a distressed look.
This often includes chemical sprays and multiple cycles of acid-washing, the toxic runoff can turn rivers indigo-blue.
Finally, there are the zippers, buttons, and rivets made of copper and other metals, whose mining is yet another source of environmental degradation.
All in all, the manufacturing process for a single pair of jeans emits over 33 kilograms of carbon— the equivalent of driving over 110 kilometers.
But this process doesn't just damage the environment.
Much of the world’s cotton is grown in developing countries, with poor labor practices and few protections for workers.
Cotton here is often picked by children or forced labor, and most jean manufacturing plants frequently expose workers to toxic chemicals throughout production.
One particularly dangerous technique called sandblasting involves spraying jeans with fine sand at high pressures and has been linked with numerous cases of incurable and often fatal lung disease.
Like many globally produced products, jeans are made in poor countries and bought in rich ones.
All these pants will likely be washed dozens or even hundreds of times per year.
This energy intensive process breaks down the plastics woven into each pair, releasing microplastics into the water and, perhaps most ironic of all, shortening the jean’s lifespan.
Like most waste, discarded jeans end up in landfills, where their decomposition releases methane gas, while their dyes and plastics leach into the soil and groundwater.
Some companies are working on solutions here, from using organic cotton to recycling and reusing denim.
You can also help reduce the environmental impact of your favorite pants by buying used jeans and buying fewer pairs altogether.
Denim manufacturers also recommend only washing your jeans once every 10 wears.
And, when possible, air dry your pants to reduce energy consumption.
Life cycle and labor problems like these extend far beyond just jeans.
Some governments are pursuing policies to make companies more responsible for worker pay and welfare, but unsustainable practices still run rampant throughout the fashion industry.
So when the price tags on your clothes seem like a steal, it’s important to consider who’s actually being robbed.
A June full moon is glowing upon this reef in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
Beneath the surface, 17,000 camouflage groupers dart about in the cloudy water.
What you’re witnessing is, in fact, an underwater orgy— turned feeding frenzy.
The water is hazy because groupers are ejecting sperm and eggs in dense clouds. This spawning behavior happens during full and new moons, when strong tidal currents carry the fertilized eggs away from corals and other voracious predators on the reef.
An orgy might seem like a rather flamboyant way to breed, but sex in the sea is a surprisingly inventive affair.
In fact, most of those voracious corals use male and female sex organs at the same time.
Corals also have mass spawning episodes, but they release buoyant bundles of eggs and sperm all at once.
This happens around half-moons, when weaker tides calm the water’s surface, creating the perfect conditions for their sex cells to couple up.
During these events, there can be hundreds of coral eggs and more than a billion sperm floating in every liter of surface seawater, where they create a sticky slick.
But corals are far from the only animals in the sea that can express two sexes.
Nearby, a humphead wrasse is undergoing a remarkable transformation.
These fish breed in groups where one male fertilizes several females.
And, likely because there aren’t many dominant males around, the largest female is becoming one.
Unlike corals, humphead wrasse can switch sexes, but they only exhibit one sex at a time.
The wrasse changes colors, loses her eyeline, and grows dramatically.
Soon, the metamorphosis is complete, and he can fertilize the females’ eggs, ensuring that procreation persists.
Interestingly, this bluestreak cleaner wrasse that’s grooming the humphead was also once a female.
But unlike the humphead, he can change sex again should he become single.
About 7,000 kilometers away, in the shallows of eastern Australia, this male mourning cuttlefish boasts a much sneakier mating strategy.
A female cuttlefish has garnered his attention, but she’s also attracted another male.
Competing directly with this rival would be a demanding ordeal, so the cuttlefish opts for trickery instead.
Positioning himself between the female and his rival, on one side, he displays a mottled skin pattern resembling that of a female to appease the competitor.
On the other, he flashes a shimmering courtship display at the female and covertly passes her parcels of sperm.
This duplicitous strategy allows the male to reproduce without putting up a fight.
These sexual escapades are just a sampling of what goes on beneath the waves.
The striking diversity of sex in the sea is partially enabled by water’s unique physical properties.
Its stable temperature and high density help preserve and disperse reproductive cells.
Unless land organisms return to the water to reproduce or have specially adapted sex cells, their options are limited.
For many terrestrial animals, reproduction is usually only possible internally, with organs that resemble the moist ocean environment.
This restriction may cause us to see only one facet of sex, but a brief tour of marine life shows us just how diverse sex really is.
It does not always involve strictly female and male individuals with differently sized sex cells that fuse internally.
Many algae, for example, have sex cells that are indistinguishable in size.
Some animals are both male and female, while others change sex.
A large proportion of organisms don’t need to touch each other to reproduce. And thousands of animals, from bluestreak cleaner wrasse to Humboldt squid, participate in same-sex sexual behavior.
So, peeking beneath the ocean’s covers doesn’t just provide a spectacle.
No one remembers when you're right, but no one forgets when you're wrong.
That's a saying we can all probably relate to.
But arguably, no one deals with the backlash of getting things wrong as regularly as a weather person.
[Am I Normal?
with Mona Chalabi] From angry Twitter posts to hate mail, people can get really annoyed when the forecast is nothing like the reality.
In 1964, the director of the Taiwan provincial weather bureau was even indicted for failing to correctly forecast the path of a typhoon.
So is our anger justified?
I decided to find out just how accurate the weatherman really is.
By comparing forecasts from 2017 to the actual temperatures that were recorded, I found that, as you'd expect, the forecast gets more accurate the closer you are to the actual date.
So, for instance, when the US National Weather Service issued a forecast seven days in advance, it was off by over six degrees Fahrenheit.
At one day in advance, their forecast was only off by about three degrees.
But even though better modeling and better technology is expected to bring us better forecasts, we may never be able to predict the weather with 100 percent accuracy.
That's because there are more than 100 tredecilion molecules in the atmosphere.
That is the number one, followed by 44 zeros.
So if we wanted to predict the weather with absolute certainty, we would need to know the position and movement of all of those particles, which is basically impossible for even our best computers.
And our drive to know the future isn't limited to the weather.
Take elections, for example.
Despite what some websites or publications may lead you to believe, the most accurate election polls are the ones that are taken on election day, not the ones that are carried out in advance.
Accurate predictions depend on accurate information.
Try to hold off as close as you can to the actual event.
And for now, go easy on your local weather person.No one remembers when you're right, but no one forgets when you're wrong.

They call you the human cannonball, but you’re really more of a pinball person.
Your act involves flying through a dozen rings of fire, bouncing through a trampoline course, and catching the trapezist in the grand finale.
Your cannon has metal coils that accelerate you to the perfect speed.
At least it’s supposed to.
Today’s pre-flight test fails dramatically, and upon inspection, this is a clear act of sabotage: someone amped the power up to the max.
It’s too late to abort the launch; the trapezist will plummet if you don’t catch him in a few minutes.
So you’d better get fixing.
The cannon was invented by your eccentric mentor, and as usual, his instructions leave something to be desired.
The cannon’s electromagnet is powered by energy cells located in 16 chambers on two levels.
Each level is a hollowed out square, with three chambers to a side.
The acceleration is survivable if: there are twice as many energy cells in the upper level as in the lower level.
Every chamber has 1 to 3 energy cells.
And each side of the cannon, made of 6 chambers, has 11 energy cells.
Your mentor designed the cannon to use a certain number of energy cells, but when the shipment arrived, it was 3 short.
So he made all of those conditions work with this reduced number, and it fired perfectly.
That’s the amount you’ll need.
Too many, or too few, and you and the trapezist are doomed.
How many energy cells should you use, and where?
Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first step in this puzzle is to narrow the options.
Let’s focus on rule 3 in isolation.
We could put 11 cells in these two corners and fulfill it with just 22 total cells, because adjacent sides share corners.
But if we put 11 in the middle chambers, we could have 44 cells.
The answer must be in the range bounded by those extremes.
We can use the other rules to refine our options further.
Since there are twice as many cells in the upper level, the total cells must be a multiple of 3. Now, because of rule 4, we need to find two consecutive multiples of 3 that can meet all the conditions.
Up to this point we haven’t used the rule that each chamber must have 1 to 3 cells.
So 36 is also out.
What about 33? We know we don’t want any sides with all 3′s, so we can place 2′s at opposite corners of the upper level.
Today’s pre-flight test fails dramatically, and upon inspection, this is a clear act of sabotage: someone amped the power up to the max.
The cannon was invented by your eccentric mentor, and as usual, his instructions leave something to be desired.
So 24 is out.
Let’s look at the other extreme.
So 36 is also out.
What about 33? We know we don’t want any sides with all 3′s, so we can place 2′s at opposite corners of the upper level.
Now we have 8 of 11 cells per side.
So we could place exactly 1 cell in each lower chamber. . . but that would fall short of the lower level’s required 11. That leaves only two options: 30 and 27, which must work by process of elimination, and 27 is the one you should use.
To total 9, the lower level must have seven 1′s and one 2. If you put the 2 in a middle chamber, the upper level would have too many cells.
So the 2 has to go into a corner, and you can then place the upper level like this.
You’ve barely snapped the last energy cell into place when you hear the ringleader announcing your act.
You’re pretty sure you’ve also noticed enough clues to solve the mystery. Who sabotaged you?
If you were a jackrabbit hopping through the desert, you’d be glad to stumble— well, maybe not stumble— across a cactus: the succulent flesh of these plants is a water source for many desert animals.
Native to the Americas and known for their spines and succulent stems, cacti of all shapes and sizes have evolved to not just survive, but thrive, in some of the harshest desert climates on Earth.
So how do they do it?
A cactus’s spines are one key to its survival— but not for the reason you might think.
Take a look at the prickly pear.
Its spines are highly modified leaves.
A normal leaf’s large surface area would be ill-suited to the desert, transpiring massive amounts of water under the baking sun.
The dramatically reduced surface area of the spines limits water loss.
They also shade the cactus and reflect the sun’s rays, reducing the plant's core temperature during the heat of the day.
Then, at night, when air temperatures plummet, the spines act as an insulating layer, keeping the cactus from cooling down too much.
These functions are just as important, if not more, than defending against predators.
From Cuba to Mexico, and as far south as Brazil and Peru, Melon cacti grow on limestone soils in seasonally dry tropical forests, where they're constantly exposed to the beating sun.
They rely on another adaptation common to cacti: a thick skin, which is coated in a waxy substance called a cuticle that limits water loss.
Meanwhile, the stomata— tiny holes that allow the exchange of gases that enable photosynthesis— remain firmly closed until night when they open.
The lower temperatures at night mean the cactus loses less water from the stem when the stomata open.
The bulk of the plant acts as a large barrel of water, storing it for times of need.
But to survive the desert, a cactus can’t just limit water loss— it has to be prepared to take full advantage of the rare situations where water is readily available.
In North America’s Sonoran Desert, the towering Saguaro cactus can grow up to 20 meters tall and live for up to 200 years.
Woody tissue, like the kind found in tree trunks, give the Saguaro its height, but the Saguaro survives with way less water than most trees.
Most of its roots are only a few inches deep.
Just below the soil’s surface, they spread out laterally for meters and hold the plant in place.
Even its single deepest root, the taproot, extends less than one meter into the ground.
After a rain, the lateral roots respond in real time, rapidly growing and spreading.
They produce ephemeral rain roots that quickly take up the available water.
The water is then pulled up into the plant body and stored in cells that contain mucilage, a gluey substance that clings to water molecules and stops them from evaporating if the plant’s tissue is ever damaged and exposed.
As the soil dries after the rain, the small rain roots also start to dry and wither away, and the cactus awaits the next time it can take advantage of a shower.
Taken together, these features make cacti well-equipped to survive their environments, from the driest desert to. . . a tropical rainforest?
So even here, the cactus survives using adaptations that long ago helped its ancestors survive the desert.
Are we designed to nap during the day?
[Sleeping With Science] Most people aim to get their recommended seven to nine hours of sleep in one long stretch at night.
And the technical term for this is “monophasic sleep.
” In other words, a single bout of sleep at night.
However, we may not have been programmed to sleep in this way.
Now I'm sure you've had that experience of a drop in your alertness in the afternoon, where you start to feel a little sleepy.
And you can also see it in other people as well, as their heads begin sort of bobbing up and down during afternoon meetings.
Now you may think this afternoon drop in your alertness is because of a big lunch, but in actual fact, it seems to be hardwired.
Because if I place electrodes on your head, there is a reliable, preprogrammed drop in your brain’s alertness during the afternoon.
And it happens to most of us somewhere between the one to four pm mark.
What this suggests is that we may have been designed to sleep in a biphasic pattern, meaning one longer bout of sleep at night and then a short afternoon nap during the day, very much like the siesta cultures around the world.
But is napping always a good thing?
Well, not necessarily.
Although we and other scientists have discovered that naps can have benefits for both the brain and for the body, naps can be a double-edged sword.
Long naps in the afternoon or in the early evening can just take the edge off your sleepiness.
It's a little bit like snacking before your main meal.
So if you are struggling with sleep at night, the best advice is not to nap during the day.
Instead, build up all of that healthy sleepiness so that you give yourself the best chance of falling asleep easily and then staying asleep soundly across the night.
But if you're not struggling with sleep and you can nap regularly during the day, the naps of around 20 minutes taken early in the day can be just fine.
A World War II veteran processes the devastation he’s witnessed from the confines of an intergalactic zoo.
As an estranged parent and child meet at a fraught family reunion, a little girl mumbles, “How do you do?
” from behind a dirty curtain.
After the death of his best friend, a lonely king travels to the end of the world in search for answers and. . . walks into a bar.
It may seem counterintuitive, but comedy is often key to a serious story.
As a writer, you need your audience to experience a range of emotions, no matter what your genre.
Whether you want to evoke fear, grief, or excitement, when people are exposed to one emotion for too long, they become desensitized to it.
Comic relief is a tried-and-true way of creating the varied emotional texture a compelling story needs.
So how can you create this effect in your own stories?
Whether you use characters, situations, language, or any combination of the three, timing and contrast are crucial.
Take the “Epic of Gilgamesh.
” This ancient Mesopotamian tale is possibly the oldest known work of literature, and yet the story remains compelling today. As King Gilgamesh approaches the end of the world, he walks into a bar.
We think we’re reaching the climax of his story— only to have our expectations subverted.
That brief respite allows the tension to build even higher to a later, true climax.
It both relieves and creates tension. This lesson also applies to modern stories: by briefly lightening the mood, you can build tension in your stories exactly when it’s needed.
You can use comic relief not only to create contrast with graver moments, but to comment on them.
Sidekicks are one of the most common and direct ways to do this: they can supply sneakily perceptive commentary on the main action, often while simultaneously serving as blundering, hapless punchlines.
Kurt Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five” takes a different approach: the story continuously alternates between horrific war scenes and wacky science fiction moments.
These scenes provide comic relief, but also open a dialogue about what’s usually unspeakable, highlighting the arbitrary nature of human suffering in a way that makes it more impactful.
Arundhati Roy’s “The God of Small Things” takes yet another approach to comic relief.
The narrative style draws upon the perspective of children to infuse a tragic story with poignant humor.
” At the same time, you know her failure to behave will only add to the tension.
Afterward, she thinks, “the play had gone bad.
Like Pickle in a monsoon.
” This punchline underscores the reality of the situation: the reunion is so forced and formal, Rahel feels like her family are actors in a play, and she feels powerless in the storm of what’s happening.
To make the most of comic relief, think not only about what moment in your story would most benefit from a splash of contrasting emotion, but also: what message you’d like to convey that you can’t say directly?
Which of your readers’ assumptions would you like to call into question?
Day after day, the twin brothers, Jun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball.
One day, their vigorous game disturbed the lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match.
But when the brothers arrived, the lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head from a tree as a trophy.
The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention of one of the lords’ daughters.
When she reached for it, the skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her.
Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law and gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke.
The second generation of twins discovered their father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, and began to play.
Soon enough, the messengers from the underworld arrived to issue another challenge.
Knowing what had happened to their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled with scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld controlled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans.
The twins pressed on, searching for the lords who had challenged them.
The lords had hidden among statues of themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito ahead of them.
When it stung the figures, the lords cried out, revealing themselves.
They forced the twins to spend the night in the House of Darkness.
They gave them a torch, but warned they must return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers adorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies.
Come morning, the lords were shocked to see the torch lit, but unburnt.
They insisted on playing the game with their own ball.
The twins agreed, only to find that the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court, trying to kill them.
The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure this would be no ordinary match.
They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored no better than a tie, leaving them to face whatever supernatural trial the lords set for them before picking up the game again.
They survived the House of Cold by lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding bones to the beasts.
But in the House of Bats, a bat bit off Junajpu’s head.
Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round of the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court.
The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke called the animals to him.
A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness of a head.
While the lords chased the ball, he swapped it with the head.
With Junajpu’s head back on his body, the twins played harder than ever.
Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash so it shattered on the ground.
The twins knew their treacherous hosts would not take the loss well.
To protect themselves, they enlisted a pair of seers.
Sure enough, the lords burned the brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains were thrown in the river, which restored them to life.
The brothers then came before the lords disguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles.
For their final trick, Ixb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him.
The lords were so delighted that they demanded the same trick be performed on them.
Still in disguise, the brothers were only too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one.
As the surviving lords realized who stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy, and the twins spoke their curse.
Henceforth, the lords would have no sacrifices and no power over the surface world.
Their days of terrorizing humans were over.
As my dear friend, Dr. Wendy Troxel often says, “Sleep is the new sex.
” And she's right.
A good night's sleep will do many things for the vibrancy, the intimacy, even the vitality of your relationship.
[Sleeping With Science] First, when couples are not getting enough sleep, they have more conflicts the next day.
And furthermore, they don't resolve those conflicts nearly as well, in part because of a loss of empathy between those two individuals.
Second, our reproductive hormones suffer, which we know are critical for healthy sexual relationship.
For example, young men who are sleeping just five hours a night for one week will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior.
In other words, a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade when it comes to certain aspects of wellness and virility.
And we see similar impairments in female reproductive health caused by a lack of sleep.
Indeed, insufficient sleep has been associated with impairments in estrogen, in luteinizing hormone and also in follicle stimulating hormone, all of which are critical for female sexual health as well as fertility.
Third, we've discovered that for a woman, just one hour of extra sleep is associated with a 14 percent increased likelihood of her wanting to be physically intimate with her partner.
So that's the impact of sleep on sex.
But it turns out that sex can also have an impact on sleep.
We know that sex before bed, resulting in orgasm, is associated with significant improvements in subjective sleep quality.
And we've even seen similar sleep associations with masturbation.
So what does all of this tell us then?
Well, sleep and sex are powerful and playful bedfellows.

A snore’s quality can range from a gentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate from the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues.
During sleep, the muscles around these tissues relax, narrowing the airway.
The narrower the respiratory tract is, the stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues may vibrate, producing sound.
Most of us will snore at some point in our lives.
This is especially troublesome because it can lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually caused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep.
There's one other kind of sleep apnea called central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily fails to regulate the body's breathing.
This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually a less prominent feature— though you can have both.
This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases, it could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues are getting less oxygen.
Features like larger tongues, thicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible.
Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting your alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding sleeping on your back may also help.
For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown to alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials.
Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep apnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work, they may consider surgery.
Snores can be silly.
But loud, chronic snoring is one sign of a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea.
It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80% of people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it.
This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually a less prominent feature— though you can have both.
If you’re experiencing obstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more seconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it, to catch your breath.
So what puts someone at risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea?
Older people are more at risk because, as we age, our soft tissues loosen, further narrowing our airways.
But when a region receives an abundance of rain, the scene is set for a startling transformation.
Gluttonous crowds of locusts produce huge amounts of poop, which carries a pheromone that furthers their transformation.
The hopper’s diet shifts to include plants with toxic alkaloids.
Soon, the locusts take on a striking pattern that warns predators of their newly poisonous nature.
Smaller groups merge into bands of millions, which mow down virtually all plant life in a kilometer-wide swath.
Roughly every week they shed and expand their exoskeletons, growing to roughly 50 times their hatching weight in just one month.
Finally, the metamorphosis is complete.
The adults beat their translucent wings and take flight as a full-fledged locust swarm.
In this gregarious phase, these long-winged, brightly colored creatures appear so different from their solitary counterparts that they were long thought to be a separate species.
A typical swarm contains more locusts than there are humans on the planet, covering hundreds of square kilometers in a dense cloud.
At these numbers, desert locusts easily overwhelm their predators.
A large swarm can match the daily food intake of a city of millions, and flying with the wind, the insect invasion can travel up to 150 kilometers a day.
This living tornado can also cross large bodies of water.
In 1988, a swarm even managed to traverse the Atlantic Ocean.
The locusts likely formed rafts to rest at night, before fueling up in the morning with a nourishing breakfast of their dead kin.
While flying over land, they seek out moist soil to lay eggs. Swarming mothers transfer their gregarious condition to their offspring, making it likely that the next generation will form another swarm.
This means that while an individual desert locust lives only three months, a plague can last up to a decade.
The potential for a years-long plague isn’t unique to desert locusts, but the region they inhabit makes the prospect particularly deadly.
Their habitat spans some of the world’s poorest countries, largely populated by people who grow their own food.
By consuming crops and pastures, these insects directly endanger 10% of humanity.
Fortunately, a desert locust plague doesn't last forever.
When a wet period ends, vegetation becomes scarce and egg laying conditions decline.
As existing swarms die off, new hatchlings spread out in search of food, creating enough distance to prevent solitary locusts from transforming.
Human intervention can also help.
Researchers use satellite imagery to identify regions at risk of becoming locust hotspots and alert local governments.
While most countries fight back with chemical insecticides, some regions have found success using fungal diseases that are lethal to locusts but safe for people and the environment.
Unfortunately, other modern practices are exacerbating the threat.
Fields densely packed with a single crop are like a table set for locusts.
And erratic weather caused by climate change makes swarms harder to predict. If we plan to discourage lonely locusts from becoming catastrophic crowds, humans need to cut carbon emissions, rethink our agriculture, and generally reconsider our own ravenous appetites.
In 2013, a group of researchers at DeepMind in London had set their sights on a grand challenge.
They wanted to create an AI system that could beat, not just a single Atari game, but every Atari game.
They developed a system they called Deep Q Networks, or DQN, and less than two years later, it was superhuman.
DQN was getting scores 13 times better than professional human games testers at “Breakout,” 17 times better at “Boxing,” and 25 times better at “Video Pinball.
” But there was one notable, and glaring, exception. When playing “Montezuma’s Revenge” DQN couldn’t score a single point, even after playing for weeks.
And what would it take to solve it?
Spoiler alert: babies.
Some systems use model-based approaches, where they have a model of the environment that they can use to predict what will happen next once they take a certain action.
They made it so that unusual or new images appearing on the screen were every bit as rewarding as real in-game points.
The ideas and inspiration here go in both directions.
And like so many home cleaners, she's using a tech platform, an app, to connect to clients.
But unlike other home cleaners, she's making $25 an hour, which is twice as much as she used to make at her previous company.
And she makes a living wage.
There's no algorithmic boss at her company that changes the pay or hours from under her feet, so she has some stability for her family.
And every week, the workers at this company are meeting to decide how to run this company.
They decide on the operations.
Esmeralda receives training in finance and management, and in conflict resolution.
And it really makes her grow as a person within that company.
So now, you might be asking, like, "What kind of company is that?
I've never heard of a tech platform that gives benefits like that. How do they do that?
" So the answer is Up and Go, and it's not your typical tech platform.
It’s what is called a “platform cooperative,” which means that the workers, the house cleaners, are sharing the governance and the ownership of this platform.
They are deciding on wages, they are deciding on benefits, they are deciding what customers are charged.
And it's a truly democratic workplace, and I think that's really what we need more of right now.
If you think of tech platforms denying workers living wages, if you think about them denying them the right to organize, and expanding economic inequality in the process, I think platform co-ops are one way to change that.
I know, I know, that for some of you, when you hear the word "co-op," you immediately think of a white guy like me standing in a food cooperative in Berkeley, selling you vegan cheese, right?
(Laughter) And I love food cooperatives, but they are not the only type of cooperative.
Co-ops are really just a group of people who have a shared need, be that vegan cheese or housecleaning, and they come together to address that need.
And that might be a business, and sometimes, it takes on other forms, but it's always about shared ownership and democratic governance.
So co-ops are nothing new.
You've heard about them.
The consumer co-ops as we know them today exist since 1844, when textile weavers in the north of England came together because their pay was cut in half and their families were starving, so they decided to sell oatmeal and sugar and flour through a store, a cooperative.
Today, cooperatives of agriculture, not just food co-ops, are quite big, so you may have heard of Land O'Lakes or Ocean Spray.
And so, platform cooperatives take the best from these tried-and-true models, the 200-year-old model of the cooperative and the much younger model of the digital platform, and bring them together.
So here's what makes them different.
And there is another thing that makes them different, which is that they are scaling equality.
And so, take Esmeralda Flores.
That's where she works in the cleaning industry, which has an annual turnover of 75 percent.
So Esmeralda has been with Up and Go almost since its beginning, so for three years.
So the women at Up and Go decided to take five percent commission, which they use to run the platform and pay for credit card bills.
And 95 percent go to the women, go to the workers themselves.
And one reason that the company can do that, that Esmeralda can be paid so much, is that there's no fiduciary duty to the shareholders to maximize profit.
And here's another thing that makes platform cooperatives different: it is that everybody at this company owns it together, so it's a shared ownership, which means that also the intellectual property of the software is owned together.
That means that they can create a small network of companies, like a social franchise, and scale up this company, to then compete against large tech companies.
And they work in more ways than one.
So I really believe that platform co-ops are a better, fairer alternative, and that's why a few years ago, together with a few friends, I started the Platform Cooperativism Consortium -- try to say that three times, fast -- at The New School in New York City.
And essentially, what we do is we support platform cooperatives, digital cooperative projects, all over the world.
The passengers pay five percent less.
And already, despite this being a very new company, it's already one of the largest worker cooperatives in the United States.
" So the entrepreneurs among you must be thinking, "God, democratic workplace?
And they are hiring tech workers.
It doesn't scale like traditional Silicon Valley companies.
Well, it kind of does.
Up and Go's sales increased by 97 percent, from 2018 to 2019, but that's really not the objective.
The platform cooperatives are not about going public, they are not about maximizing profits.
They scale differently, they scale more affordably than brick-and-mortar cooperatives.
They scale by creating networks of companies that then compete against large companies. They scale more quickly, because their co-op can be anywhere in the world, and they scale democracy, because they can be decentralized through crypto networks and blockchain.
And that is why I want instructors to teach about this model in law schools and business schools.
That's why I want entrepreneurs to start one instead of another traditional tech platform.
And that’s why I want incubators to include this model and also unions to start platform cooperatives.
And that’s why I want ethical social impact investors to consider them and create an amazing legacy of equality.
Now, I'm not here to tell you that this one model will eradicate economic inequality forever. It's not, right?
But what we need is more variety in the economy.
We need small, unionized private businesses, we need employee ownership, and we need platform cooperatives. We face big challenges.
But here's what gives me a lot of hope. When markets fail and the safety nets of governments break down, people turn to each other, right?
People start to cooperate by forming food cooperatives so that they can feed themselves during a crisis.
They start to form platform cooperatives so that they can clean homes and still make a living wage.
And when markets and governments for too long failed to address structural racism and inequality, people form institutions, like the Black Panthers' Free Breakfast Program for Children and the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the United States.
So we saw democracy, or the aspiration to participatory democracy, spread across countries around the world, and now, it's time for it to spread in the workplace.
Thank you.

So Esmeralda has been with Up and Go almost since its beginning, so for three years.
But let me just give you a bit of a taste of this.
I have two examples that are really close to my heart.
I've told you about platform co-ops mostly in the labor sector, and also transportation, mobility and short-term rental, but they can also transform entire sectors, such as the care sector, culture and the arts, higher education and the data economy.
I mean, just imagine, if our data would be managed cooperatively, cooperative data trusts, data cooperatives.
So I know we are here, near Silicon Valley, so I can see that, I'm sure, for many of you, you will think, "Wow, I'm not so sure about this.
I mean, this would just never scale, right?
" I've heard this many times.
And it doesn't, right?

If you were buying a car in 1899, you would’ve had three major options to choose from.
You could buy a steam-powered car.
Typically relying on gas-powered boilers, these could drive as far as you wanted— provided you also wanted to lug around extra water to refuel and didn’t mind waiting 30 minutes for your engine to heat up.
Alternatively, you could buy a car powered by gasoline.
However, the internal combustion engines in these models required dangerous hand-cranking to start and emitted loud noises and foul-smelling exhaust while driving.
So your best bet was probably option number three: a battery-powered electric vehicle.
These cars were quick to start, clean and quiet to run, and if you lived somewhere with access to electricity, easy to refuel overnight.
If this seems like an easy choice, you're not alone.
By the end of the 19th century, nearly 40% of American cars were electric.
In cities with early electric systems, battery-powered cars were a popular and reliable alternative to their occasionally explosive competitors.
But electric vehicles had one major problem— batteries.
Early car batteries were expensive and inefficient.
Many inventors, including Thomas Edison, tried to build batteries that stored more electricity.
Others even built exchange stations in urban areas to swap out dead batteries for charged ones.
But these measures weren’t enough to allow electric vehicles to make long trips. And at over twice the price of a gas-powered car, many couldn’t afford these luxury items.
Electric starters removed the need for hand-cranking, mufflers made engines quieter and rubber engine mounts reduced vibration.
In 1908, Ford released the Model T; a cheap, high-quality gas-powered car that captured the public imagination. By 1915, the percentage of electric cars on the road had plummeted.
But other companies were developing increasingly efficient batteries to power a new wave of portable electronics.
Alongside regulatory mandates by California to reduce smog, these innovations sparked a small wave of new electric vehicles, including hybrid cars.
But in 2008, Tesla Motors went further, grabbing the attention of consumers, automakers, and regulators with its lithium-ion-powered Roadster.
This purely electric vehicle could travel more than 320 kilometers on a single charge, almost doubling the previous record.
They can accelerate much faster than gas-powered sports cars, and while some models still have a high upfront cost, they reliably save their drivers money in the long run.
As governments around the world focus on slowing climate change, electric vehicles are now expected to replace gas-powered ones altogether. In Norway, 75% of car sales in 2020 were plug-in electric vehicles.
Soon, electric cars will reclaim their place on the road, putting gasoline in our rearview.If you were buying a car in 1899, you would’ve had three major options to choose from.

At the same time, oil discoveries lowered the price of gasoline, and new advances made internal combustion engines more appealing.

For the next 55 years, internal combustion engines ruled the roads.
By the 1990s, energy dense nickel metal hydride batteries were on the market, soon followed by lithium-ion batteries.
Alongside regulatory mandates by California to reduce smog, these innovations sparked a small wave of new electric vehicles, including hybrid cars.
Hybrids aren’t true electric vehicles; their nickel metal hydride batteries are only used to optimize the efficiency of gas-burning engines.
But in 2008, Tesla Motors went further, grabbing the attention of consumers, automakers, and regulators with its lithium-ion-powered Roadster.
This purely electric vehicle could travel more than 320 kilometers on a single charge, almost doubling the previous record.
Since then, electric vehicles have vastly improved in cost, performance, efficiency, and availability.
They can accelerate much faster than gas-powered sports cars, and while some models still have a high upfront cost, they reliably save their drivers money in the long run.
As governments around the world focus on slowing climate change, electric vehicles are now expected to replace gas-powered ones altogether. In Norway, 75% of car sales in 2020 were plug-in electric vehicles.
And policies such as California’s Zero Emission Vehicle mandate and Europe’s aggressive CO2 emission standards have dramatically slowed investments in gas-powered vehicles worldwide.
Soon, electric cars will reclaim their place on the road, putting gasoline in our rearview.
When it comes to toothpaste commercials, you've probably heard claims like, nine out of 10 dentists recommend "Brighter, Whiter.
" Or maybe it's four out of five or 80 percent.
But either way, these companies expect you to see a wall of white coats, trust their authority and think no further.
Now that approach is basically BS, and you probably know it's BS, but the question is: How can you trust your BS radar?
[Am I Normal?
with Mona Chalabi] Well, when I'm faced with suspicious statistics, I tend to ask myself three questions.
First, what were people actually asked?
Sometimes the question that is put to survey respondents is wildly different than the one that ends up on posters and billboards.
For instance, in 2007, one toothpaste ad in the UK claimed that more than 80 percent of dentists recommended their products.
What that sounds like is that a majority of dentists prefer their product over all others, that those dentists were asked if this was the best product.
But when the Advertising Standards Authority looked into it, they discovered that the dentists were asked to recommend several toothpastes, not one single choice.
In fact, another brand was found to be almost as popular.
To no one's surprise, the ad was deemed misleading.
Now, the second question to ask is: What aren’t you telling me?
In the 1970s, a sugarless gum company claimed that four out five dentists recommended their product.
Now, their slogan was pretty upfront about the fact that these dentists were only recommending the product to people who already chewed gum, but they weren't so forthcoming about the fifth dentist.
Decades later, the manufacturer made fun of it in a new ad campaign where they blamed the fifth dentist's different thinking on a freak accident, like a sudden squirrel bite.
Now, since I'm all about the deviations in the data, I decided to look into this a little bit further.
In fact, it's not that the fifth dentist recommended chewing sugary gum.
What they don't say is that most of them recommended that their patients don't chew gum at all.
The last thing to ask is: What was the survey context?
Because there's a really big difference between saying "nine out of 10 dentists agree," and "nine out of these 10 dentists agree.
" Size matters and so does methodology.
According to the American Dental Association, there are about 200,000 registered dentists in the US.
I’m not going to bore you with the maths here, but to get a statistically significant sample of 200,000 people, you need about 400. So if you're reading in the fine print that only 50 dentists were surveyed, you know that's not statistically significant.
It's just a marketing ploy.
So the next time you see one of these ads, ask yourself: What were people actually asked?
What's gone unsaid?
And what was the survey context?
Nine out of 10 Monas agree.
[*No such survey took place]When it comes to toothpaste commercials, you've probably heard claims like, nine out of 10 dentists recommend "Brighter, Whiter.
In fact, it's not that the fifth dentist recommended chewing sugary gum.
Then it selects one member of the antivirus squad— this’ll be you— and brings them into the mainframe.
If they destroy the corrupted one, the malware will be defeated.
Any others, and the virus will erase the entire system.
The lights are only visible within the mainframe, so you won’t know until you get there which, if any, are on.
How can you communicate, with your single action, which of the 4 disks has been corrupted?
Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The setting is a big clue for one solution.
Let’s consider one possibility.
Say that the corrupted disk was this one, and when you come in, no lights are on.
You could turn 11 on to indicate that disk.
Okay, what if you came in and 11 was already on?
You have to switch one light.
Which seems like the most innocuous to change?
Probably 00, in that if you were to add 00 and 11, you’d still get 11. So maybe the key is to think of addition of binary numbers, with the sum of the lit disks communicating the corrupted disk number.
This works great, until we start with a different hypothetical.
What if 00 was the corrupted disk, and 01 and 10 were on?
Here, the sum of the lit disks is 11. But we need to change this to a sum of 00 with the flip of one switch.
We have four options: turning switch 00 on gives us 11. Turning 01 off takes us back to 10, and turning 10 off gives 01. None of those work.
Turning switch 11 on gives us 110 by standard binary addition.
But we don’t really want three digit numbers.
So what if— to keep the result a two digit number— we break the rules a bit and let this sum equal 22. That’s not a binary number, but if we regard 2s as the same as 0s, that does indicate the correct disk.
So this suggests a strategy: look at the sum of all the lighted disks we see, regarding 2s as 0s.
If it’s already the correct result, flip 00, and if not, find the switch that will make the sum correct.
You can see for yourself that any starting configuration can sum to any number from 00 to 11 with a flip of a switch.
The reason this works is related to a concept called parity.
Parity tells you whether a given value is even or odd.
In this case, the values whose parity we’re considering are the number of 1s in each digit place of our binary sums.
And that’s why we can say that 2 and 0, both even numbers, can be treated as equivalents.
By adding or subtracting 00, 01, 10, or 11, we can change the parity of either, both, or neither digit, and create the disk number we want.
What’s incredible about this solution is that it works for any mainframe whose disks are a power of two.
With 64 you could turn each activated disk into a 6-bit binary number and sum the 1s in each column, regarding any even sum as the same as 0 and any odd sum as 1. 1,048,576 disks would be daunting, but entirely doable.
Luckily, your mainframe is much smaller.
You make the valiant sacrifice and your team rushes in, destroying the corruption and freeing the system.Your antivirus squad is up against a particularly sadistic bit of malicious code that’s hijacked your mainframe.
What you’ve learned from other infected systems— right before they went dark— is that it likes to toy with antivirus agents in a very peculiar way.
Any others, and the virus will erase the entire system.
Say that the corrupted disk was this one, and when you come in, no lights are on.
You have to switch one light.
Probably 00, in that if you were to add 00 and 11, you’d still get 11. So maybe the key is to think of addition of binary numbers, with the sum of the lit disks communicating the corrupted disk number.
If it’s already the correct result, flip 00, and if not, find the switch that will make the sum correct.
Luckily, your mainframe is much smaller.

How long does it take to get over a breakup?
The good news is I've done the research for you.
The bad news is that you might not like the answer.
[Am I Normal?
with Mona Chalabi] See, a few years back, a number of publications were touting a study telling their readers that it takes 11 weeks to get over a breakup.
That's nearly three months spent listening to depressing music while putting on a brave face.
It might feel longer than it is, but it's only a few swipes on the calendar app.
No big deal, right?
Well, unfortunately, it's not so straightforward.
See, those articles drastically misrepresented that study.
In fact, the study never said anything about how long it takes to get over a breakup.
It only focused on the aftereffects of ending a relationship, specifically among undergrads, which is a whole other can of worms.
To really answer that question of how long it takes to get over a breakup, you would need to do a longitudinal study, a study that would basically follow a ton of people from the moment of their breakup and track their progress year after year after year.
But studies like that are expensive and complicated to carry out.
So with no adequate data, I decided to seek professional help.
I went to couples therapists, Dr. Hod Tamir.
He has anecdotal experience with countless people in relationships and, full disclosure, he was my couple’s therapist, too.
So I asked him how long he thinks it takes to get over a breakup.
"I don't think there is a magic number . . . If we feel like we can express ourselves in how we're feeling, we don't have to keep it bottled up.
Once you're doing other things that you're engaged with and distracted by, then at some point you look back and like, 'Oh yeah, that's my ex.
' And you notice that the feelings that you have are not as raw.
You can bump into each other and not feel pain.
" And the data supports Dr. Tamir's theory.
One study looked at different strategies for love regulation.
In other words, can a few simple methods change how much you love someone?
The study found that when participants were distracted into thinking about something other than their ex, like, their favorite hobby or ideal career, their love feelings for their ex stayed the same, but it did make them feel more pleasant.
Using distractions to start to feel better is exactly what Dr. Tamir has suggested.
The study also found that a negative reappraisal strategy, essentially remembering all of the shit things your ex said and did, does decrease love feelings for your ex.
But it also makes you feel "unpleasant," and I'm guessing that means sad.
Finally, a third, more zen strategy known as reappraisal of love feelings.
For this, participants had to muse over statements like "Love is part of life" and "It's OK to love someone I'm no longer with.
" Yeah, that changed nothing at all for them.
Overall, the researchers concluded, and I'm not using the scientific language here, that concentrating on the bad things about your ex can help you to feel less in love.
While distracting yourself with other subjects, as my therapist suggested, can actually make you feel better. However, the research and Dr. Tamir would both tell you that while distraction is good in the short term, it is not a long-term solution.
"Taking that time to process and understand it is actually a much quicker way to heal than ignoring it.
" Eventually, for the sake of ourselves and our future partners, we're going to have to face up to our feelings.
So how long does it take to get over a breakup?
Well, we don't have enough long-term studies to know.
But more importantly, I’ve learned that instead of counting down the days, we're much better off reconnecting with the things we love to do.
Finding something to distract us and unpacking our feelings when we're ready.
If we can do all that, then one day hopefully we'll come out of it feeling OK.

Every day, the sands of the Sahara Desert reach temperatures up to 80° Celsius.
Stretching over roughly nine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about 22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year.
That’s well over 100 times more energy than humanity consumes annually.
So, could covering the desert with solar panels solve our energy problems for good?
Solar panels work when light particles hit their surface with enough energy to knock electrons out of their stable bonds.
On their journey back to stability, these electrons produce electricity.
However, there’s a limit to how much power panels can generate.
Solar panels can only interact with certain wavelengths of light, making it impossible to convert over half the sunlight they receive.
And even light particles they can convert often bounce off them without ever hitting an electron.
But thanks to clever scientists and engineers and substantial government investment, solar panels are generating more electricity than ever.
Anti-reflective coatings and patterns on the panels’ surface create more opportunities for incoming light particles to hit electrons.
These techniques have increased commercial solar panel efficiency from the low-teens to 25%, with experimental models reaching up to 47%.
What’s more, solar has gotten 89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains for other technologies that use the same materials.
Together, these factors have made solar power the cheapest source of electricity on Earth.
Countries including India, China, Egypt, and the US, have already taken these new panels into the desert.
Their massive solar farms range from 15 to 56 square kilometers, and when the sun is high in the sky, these plants can provide energy for hundreds of thousands of local residents.
But these farms also get extremely hot.
Light that solar cells don’t convert or reflect is absorbed as heat, which reduces a panel’s efficiency.
And the cooling systems employed by many farms can use huge amounts of energy powering fans or moving water to maintain optimal temperatures.
Even with these systems, solar panels in the desert absorb far more heat than the natural sandy environment.
This hasn’t been a problem on the scale of existing solar farms.
But if we tried to cover the Sahara, this effect could create massive changes in the region's climate.
Constructing solar farms already disrupts local ecosystems, but a plant of this scale could dramatically transform the desert landscape.
Thankfully, solar panels aren’t our only option.
And some of the largest solar plants in the world are trying a new approach: giant mirrors.
Morocco’s Noor Power Plant, which will eventually cover roughly 30 square kilometers of the Sahara, is a concentrated solar power plant.
This design reflects light onto a receiver, which converts that energy to heat, and then electricity.
And since it takes time for the materials being heated to cool off, these plants often continue producing electricity past sunset.
Whether they use panels or mirrors, industrial solar farms are often easy to fit into existing energy infrastructure.
However, getting their electricity beyond local power grids is much more difficult.
Some countries are working on ways to connect electric grids across the globe.
But right now, these techniques are still too expensive and inefficient to rely on.
Worse still, industrial renewables can share some of the same problems as fossil fuels, relying on destructive mining operations and carbon-emitting global supply chains.
Fortunately, solar can exist on many scales, from industrial solar farms to smaller installations that power individual buildings and rural communities.
Stretching over roughly nine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about 22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year.
That’s well over 100 times more energy than humanity consumes annually.
What’s more, solar has gotten 89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains for other technologies that use the same materials.
And the cooling systems employed by many farms can use huge amounts of energy powering fans or moving water to maintain optimal temperatures.
And some of the largest solar plants in the world are trying a new approach: giant mirrors.
These mirrors still create a dangerous temperature shift for local wildlife, but they have less potential to transform the landscape.
Just like Hurston, Janie defies the restrictive expectations for a woman in her time.
Early in the novel, Hurston writes that “there are years that ask questions and years that answer,” suggesting that life can only truly be understood by living it.
But through her empathetic storytelling, Hurston invites us into Janie’s life, her life, and the lives of so many other women.
Chris Anderson: A year go at global Countdown's virtual launch, Monica Araya, who, among many other things, is a distinguished fellow at the ClimateWorks Foundation, she shared news of a campaign to take on the massive emissions from the world's cars, trucks and buses, etc.
And we have an exciting update that we want to share with you.
Monica, welcome here to the Countdown stage.
Monica Araya: Thank you.
It's so great to be here, and so great to see you in person.
(Applause) CA: So look, you're up against a vast industry.
I mean, there are more than a billion polluting vehicles out there.
How on Earth can you attempt system change at that scale?
MA: Well, that is the point that, because of the scale and because of the speed that we need to inject into this transformation, we have to work with all the levers of change simultaneously.
That's the key point.
So, cities, we have to engage with cities.
That's great.
Not enough.
We have to engage with politicians.
We have to engage with the companies themselves.
We have to create business coalitions.
And we also have to empower citizens so that they play their act.
Ultimately, we know that we have to create political space for stricter regulations for policy.
So that is something we are doing right now.
CA: In a sense, these aren't separate initiatives.
They all build on each other?
MA: Exactly.
So think about an automaker.
Maybe we have some in the room.
It's working.
We're saving money.
" Then you have to act.
CA: But how could you take on all these agendas at once?
MA: That's the point.
You can't do just one thing, or you can't just expect one single organization to do this.
So this is the exciting news.
A group of over 70 -- seven, zero -- organizations are coming together, creating a coalition, a global campaign, we call it Drive Electric, and it's already shaking things up.
MA: Well, the best thing would be to give you one example from this year.
So if you look at the progress we’re making, yes, it’s there, and yet, only one percent of the global stock of cars and trucks is electric right now.
MA: So here's the point.
But, look, you're up against industries that are, you know, getting trillions of dollars of revenue annually.
So that's why we're saying Drive Electric is the most ambitious coalition and campaign in our space ever undertaken.
And what we need to make sure is that we grow it, we grow the partners and we secure funding for what they do because they are playing a key role in their geographies, playing all these levers.
So we have to make sure they get the resources to work on the ground.
CA: So you’re raising money, not just for ClimateWorks but for all of these partners.
MA: Yes.
CA: How much is it going to take?
MA: For the next five years, roughly one billion dollars.
CA: I mean, Monica, as you know, when I when first heard that number, I said, “No way.
” I mean, you're looking for this from philanthropists.
There's no precedent for that.
And yet this is kind of where the exciting news comes in, because . . . Drive Electric and TED and Countdown and a coalition of visionary donors called the Audacious Project have been working together on this, and just a few weeks ago, something kind of amazing happened.
We were able to secure a commitment from them for how much?
MA: 300 million dollars.
(Applause) CA: This was really exciting, and it builds on a couple hundred million already committed by the founding donors of Drive Electric, so that we're already over halfway to your billion-dollar goal, right?
So how is this?
How does this feel?
Where are you now?
MA: It's electrifying.
(Laughter) But I mean, I know there partners are here, I can see where they are sitting, from foundations, I’m sure Anthony’s somewhere here.
We are so excited because we have come to a point where we know this campaign is unstoppable.
And in short, you know, we are going to make sure that all of this gets translated into all these strategies that we have to deploy in the key geographies.
And, think about the fact that this is happening just as we move to COP.
So that is also very good news.
CA: And everyone in this room can actually play a part.
Or indeed, if you're watching online.
If you live in a city, please advocate to create and expand a green zone where only electric vehicles are welcome.
If you work in government, raise your level of ambition.
Ignore the fossilized lobbyists.
This is a winning political issue for you.
MA: If you are a citizen, consider not buying an internal-combustion car.
And why not share it?
Share it with friends, share it in your social media.
CA: And finally, if you work for a company that makes or uses cars, trucks, motorized vehicles of any kind, do what you can to urge them to get on the right side of history.
I mean, Monica, what do you think, can we actually do this?
MA: Yes, we have to work together, go faster.
And let me finish by saying this.
This campaign is about changing transportation, with all the benefits that that brings to people and the planet.
And yet, it is also about showing how systems change works in practice and making sure it happens everywhere else.
So let's do it.
CA: Thank you, Monica.
Thank you, everyone.
(Applause)Chris Anderson: A year go at global Countdown's virtual launch, Monica Araya, who, among many other things, is a distinguished fellow at the ClimateWorks Foundation, she shared news of a campaign to take on the massive emissions from the world's cars, trucks and buses, etc.

So this is the exciting news.
A group of over 70 -- seven, zero -- organizations are coming together, creating a coalition, a global campaign, we call it Drive Electric, and it's already shaking things up.
CA: How so?
MA: Well, the best thing would be to give you one example from this year.
So partners of this coalition have done an amazing job persuading the European Commission to propose that after 2035, there will be no more sales of petrol and diesel cars.
And this alone was unthinkable two years ago.
And even though I mentioned in Europe, the progress is happening from China to California, everything in between, including the small countries.
CA: So Monica, what’s the overall goal of the Drive Electric campaign?
MA: Well, we have to persuade the world to do exactly what I just mentioned, and actually in some cities and some countries, you can actually go faster.
And the point is that we need to set these timelines, make it normal, you know.
Say, after this year, say, 2035, we're not going to sell more petrol and diesel cars.
And now our campaign works with all segments.
So we say, buses 2030, trucks 2040. And if we want to get there, if we say we have to be here by 2035, then the next five years are so critical.
So that is what we have to achieve.
You know, we have to get to these mark and tipping point.
CA: But just to play devil's advocate there.
MA: I know you like to do that.
CA: Well, you know.
MA: It's OK.
CA: Wouldn't some people say that actually were kind of already at that tipping point?
And that in a sense, the move to electrification is already inevitable?
MA: Thank you, because that's a very important question.
You know, it reflects that we're making progress, and that's a good thing.
So somebody could say, well, you know, let's take Tesla, you know, super pioneering, deserves a lot of credit.
And yet if we look at our partners, early on, they advocated the very policies to promote early adoption of electric vehicles.
So timing is everything.
We cannot waste any time.
So if you look at the progress we’re making, yes, it’s there, and yet, only one percent of the global stock of cars and trucks is electric right now.
So we have to keep that in mind and also, you know, coming from a developing country myself, Costa Rica, as you know, I would not say that in the global South, this is already inevitable.
In fact, when you look at some industry projections, you still find that at least some companies see a lot of fossil fuel cars in their future up to 2050. CA: OK, so if that's still happening in 2050, we're screwed.
So the goal of the campaign is basically to accelerate that by how much?
So that's a huge, huge number.
So that's why we're saying Drive Electric is the most ambitious coalition and campaign in our space ever undertaken.
So that is also very good news.
If you live in a city, please advocate to create and expand a green zone where only electric vehicles are welcome.
If you work in government, raise your level of ambition.
Ignore the fossilized lobbyists.
This is a winning political issue for you.
MA: If you are a citizen, consider not buying an internal-combustion car.
And why not share it?
Share it with friends, share it in your social media.
If you are a creative, if you are an influencer, if you're an artist, help us.
We need to find new and better ways of telling the story.
CA: And finally, if you work for a company that makes or uses cars, trucks, motorized vehicles of any kind, do what you can to urge them to get on the right side of history.
I mean, Monica, what do you think, can we actually do this?
MA: Yes, we have to work together, go faster.
And let me finish by saying this.
This campaign is about changing transportation, with all the benefits that that brings to people and the planet.
And yet, it is also about showing how systems change works in practice and making sure it happens everywhere else.
So let's do it.
CA: Thank you, Monica.
Thank you, everyone.

Mohammadpur has always had a unique relationship with the weather.
Located at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, this coastal village was built on top of the Meghna River delta.
Deltas are a kind of landmass formed when sediment carried by rivers is deposited where that river meets a larger body of water.
River deltas are incredibly fertile ecosystems capable of supporting abundant agriculture and marine life.
However, their borders gradually change as rivers bring more sediment in and storms wash sediment away.
The residents of Mohammadpur are well accustomed to managing the ebbs and flows of this ever-shifting landscape.
But lately, an abundance of intense cyclones have caused frequent flooding that impedes farming and fishing.
These floods also erode the coastline, allowing later storms to wipe away land altogether.
Since 2000, the Meghna River has overtaken the coastline by 2.5 kilometers, forcing many villagers to move inland or to nearby cities.
Mohammadpur isn’t the only place where erratic weather is impacting people’s mobility.
Repeated typhoons in the Philippines have displaced thousands from their homes.
In Fiji, the government is already moving many coastal villages inland to get ahead of predicted land loss.
And in the United States, melting permafrost is causing chunks of the Alaskan coastline to erode.
In some ways, this is nothing new.
Humanity has always adapted to changing weather and moved to regions that best support cultural lifestyles and livelihoods.
However, scientists agree that this rise in extreme weather is a by-product of Earth’s rapidly changing climate.
Global warming increases the frequency and intensity of storms, flooding and drought, while also melting polar ice caps and raising sea levels.
These factors are changing the environment much faster than they have in the past.
Even for communities with the resources to take action, the variable pace and nature of these changes makes them difficult to adapt to.
And the vulnerable populations most impacted by climate change are often those least responsible.
Many facing climate mobility live in farming and fishing communities in countries that generate dramatically fewer emissions than their larger counterparts.
Bangladesh is one such country.
And for others, leaving Bangladesh isn’t financially practical.
A handful of individuals might even cross international borders, if they have family, friends, or work connections on the other side.
Unfortunately, it's unclear when weather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed projects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion.
Island residents are planting coastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land with dredged sand to shield themselves against storms and rising sea levels.
And the islands’ governments have repeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions to reduce pollution and take responsibility for climate change.
River deltas are incredibly fertile ecosystems capable of supporting abundant agriculture and marine life.
However, their borders gradually change as rivers bring more sediment in and storms wash sediment away.
The residents of Mohammadpur are well accustomed to managing the ebbs and flows of this ever-shifting landscape.
These floods also erode the coastline, allowing later storms to wipe away land altogether.
In Fiji, the government is already moving many coastal villages inland to get ahead of predicted land loss.
The nation has a unique combination of low-lying geography and heavily populated coastal regions.
So to stay with their communities, many have moved a few meters inland and built more resilient homes on higher ground or elevated stilts.
Others have tried to buy land on newly emerging islands in the delta, while some have sent family members to find work in nearby cities.
A handful of individuals might even cross international borders, if they have family, friends, or work connections on the other side.
But many of the residents who’ve left are eager to return home.
Unfortunately, it's unclear when weather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed projects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion.
In other parts of the world, people couldn’t move inland even if they wanted to.
The low-lying Pacific Island nations of Kiribati and Tuvalu are only 811 square kilometers and 26 square kilometers, respectively; so migration would mean moving to a different country altogether.
Instead, their governments and citizens have united in physically, legally, and politically fortifying their countries.
Island residents are planting coastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land with dredged sand to shield themselves against storms and rising sea levels.
And the islands’ governments have repeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions to reduce pollution and take responsibility for climate change.
The challenges facing each coastal community are unique, and the diversity of the people's experiences can make climate mobility a difficult phenomenon to measure and define.
But as new communities are endangered by extreme weather, it’s more important than ever to listen to those on the front lines of this crisis.
Inside our cells, each of us has a second set of genes completely separate from the 23 pairs of chromosomes we inherit from our parents.
And this isn’t just the case for humans— it’s true of every animal, plant, and fungus, and nearly every multicellular organism on Earth.
This second genome belongs to our mitochondria, an organelle inside our cells.
They’re not fully a part of us, but they’re not separate either— so why are they so different from anything else in our bodies?
Approximately 1.5 billion years ago, scientists think a single-celled organism engulfed the mitochondria’s ancestor, creating the predecessor of all multicellular organisms.
Mitochondria play an essential role: they convert energy from the food we eat and oxygen we breathe into a form of energy our cells can use, which is a molecule called ATP.
Without this energy, our cells start to die.
Humans have over 200 types of cells, and all except mature red blood cells have mitochondria.
That’s because a red blood cell’s job is to transport oxygen, which mitochondria would use up before it could reach its destination.
So all mitochondria use oxygen and metabolites to create energy and have their own DNA, but mitochondrial DNA varies more across species than other DNA.
In mammals, mitochondria usually have 37 genes.
In some plants, like cucumbers, mitochondria have up to 65 genes, and some fungal mitochondria have only 1. A few microbes that live in oxygen-poor environments seem to be on the way to losing their mitochondria entirely, and one group, oxymonad monocercomonoides, already has.
This variety exists because mitochondria are still evolving, both in tandem with the organisms that contain them, and separately, on their own timeline.
To understand how that’s possible, it helps to take a closer look at what the mitochondria inside us are doing, starting from the moment we’re conceived.
In almost all species, mitochondrial DNA is passed down from only one parent.
In humans and most animals, that parent is the mother.
Sperm contain approximately 50 to 75 mitochondria in the tail, to help them swim.
These dissolve with the tail after conception.
Meanwhile, an egg contains thousands of mitochondria, each containing multiple copies of the mitochondrial DNA.
This translates to over 150,000 copies of mitochondrial DNA that we inherit from our mothers, each of which is independent and could vary slightly from the others.
As a fertilized egg grows and divides, those thousands of mitochondria are divvied up into the cells of the developing embryo.
In one legend, a prominent Athenian heard his nephew singing one of their songs and enjoyed it so much that he asked the boy to teach it to him— “So that I may learn it and die,” he said.
One 2nd century Christian leader called Sappho “a whore who sang about her own licentiousness.
” Later, a Pope and Archbishop ordered her poetry burned.
Almost all of it had vanished by the Middle Ages.
Then, about a century ago, people began rediscovering Sappho’s poetry— in locations like an ancient Egyptian garbage dump.
Now, we have around 700 lines, representing less than 10% of Sappho’s total known work.
We only have one complete poem of hers.
About a dozen others are substantial, but most are mere fragments.
New pieces of Sappho’s songs probably will be found.
Some may already be sitting in museum archives, to be revealed when technology allows scholars to read through scrolls too fragile to unroll.
What we are currently left with is an incomplete record— and many historical rumors.
Ovid insisted that Sappho fell in love with a ferryman and, upon being rejected, leapt from a cliff to her death.
Another tale asserts that she ran a girls’ school and those mentioned in her poems were merely students for whom she felt platonic affection.
Current consensus is that these stories, which ridicule Sappho or deny her work’s homoeroticism, are probably all untrue artifacts of misogyny and homophobia.
Despite the distortions of the intervening millennia, Sappho’s words reach across time and resonate today.
More than 2,000 years ago, she wrote: “I say someone in another time will remember us” And, thankfully, we do.
The year is 1249 CE. The French King Louis IX is sailing the Nile, threatening to overthrow the Egyptian sultan and capture Egypt.
Egypt’s army commanders ask the sultan’s wife, Shajar Al-Durr, to report this news to the sultan, who has been injured in battle.
But they don’t know the truth: the sultan is already dead, and Shajar Al-Durr is secretly ruling in his stead.
Born around 1220 CE, Shajar Al-Durr, whose name means “tree of pearls,” was sold into slavery.
This was a common fate for Christian children from Turkic countries like her.
Enslaved boys, or mamaleek, were trained to be elite military personnel serving the Egyptian Sultanate, while enslaved girls were forced to become concubines.
As a teenager, Shajar Al-Durr became a concubine to the son of the Egyptian sultan, As-Salih Ayyub.
They had a son named Khalil who died in infancy, and As-Salih freed her so he could court her formally.
As-Salih became sultan, and he and Shajar Al-Durr married.
When As-Salih died in the middle of the conflict with the crusaders, Shajar Al-Durr knew King Louis IX had already succeeded in conquering important Egyptian port cities.
Fearing that her husband’s death would threaten the army’s morale, she decided to keep it a secret.
To conceal his death, she had food brought to his tent, and forged his signature on decrees to govern the sultanate and advise military commanders.
When the crusaders attacked the Egyptian city of Al-Mansurah, Egyptian soldiers ambushed the crusaders and took the French king hostage.
Meanwhile, the truth about the sultan’s death began to leak.
Shajar Al-Durr invited her late husband’s son with another woman to claim the title of sultan.
At first, both she and her mamaleek advisers supported her stepson’s claim to the throne.
But then he began threatening to exile her and kill the mamaleek, making wild accusations about them.
The mamaleek had served Shajar Al-Durr’s husband before her, and seen her capable rule so far.
To increase her visibility and solidify her claim to the throne, she constructed a public mausoleum for her husband, issued the currency under her name, and signed decrees as Walidat Khalil, the mother of Khalil.
Egypt’s army commanders ask the sultan’s wife, Shajar Al-Durr, to report this news to the sultan, who has been injured in battle.
But they don’t know the truth: the sultan is already dead, and Shajar Al-Durr is secretly ruling in his stead.
As a teenager, Shajar Al-Durr became a concubine to the son of the Egyptian sultan, As-Salih Ayyub.
When the crusaders attacked the Egyptian city of Al-Mansurah, Egyptian soldiers ambushed the crusaders and took the French king hostage.
They thought she would make a better ruler than the unpredictable prince, and conspired with her to assassinate him.
In spite of her success leading Egypt through this military crisis, she had to work to cement her credibility in the eyes of the public.
As a formerly enslaved person, her rise to power wasn’t linked to royal ancestry, while as a woman, societal restrictions prevented her from participating in many of the events a sultan would typically attend.
To increase her visibility and solidify her claim to the throne, she constructed a public mausoleum for her husband, issued the currency under her name, and signed decrees as Walidat Khalil, the mother of Khalil.
Unfortunately, the sultanate’s premier religious authority, the caliph of Baghdad, still objected to having a woman rule.
Under threat of revolt, Shajar Al-Durr married on the condition that her new husband must divorce his first wife.
Shajar Al-Durr intended to maintain her status as supreme ruler.
Her new husband threatened to undermine her rule by arranging a political marriage between himself and a princess from Mosul.
So Shajar Al-Durr ordered his assassination.
The news reached his first wife, who successfully plotted to murder the Sultana.
Shajar Al-Durr’s killers threw her body from the Cairo citadel.
Shajar Al-Durr left no personal writings, but her legacy was lasting.
Before her death, she built her own mausoleum with a madrasa, garden, public shower, and palace, decorated with her signature tree of pearls to remind Egyptians who made it.
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue submarine was the easy part.
Hacking into the nuclear missile launch override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: you don’t have the override code.
You know you need the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used to authorize the launch.
But one wrong answer will lock you out.
From your hiding spot, you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own.
So he gave one launch code to Minion A, the other to minion B, and forbade them to share the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number and activated the countdown.
That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left before the missiles launch.
Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— your launch codes were actually related.
” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know you know my number too.
What numbers do you enter to override the launch?
5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become sums in multiple ways.
That ambiguity forces us to go through unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums can result from its factors, then break those apart and see what products can result.
We’ll soon have to do something similar going from sums to products and back to sums.
But now we know— when A made his first statement, he must have been holding either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information we do, so he knows this too.
Let’s review what’s in each brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum, but only B knows the product.
Now let’s look at the first part of B’s statement.
7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums, but 5 and 6 both are.
Meaning that B wouldn’t know whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option because it contradicts his statement.
So this is great— 5 and 4 could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one?
Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively.
With seconds to spare you override the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub to the bottom of the ocean.Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue submarine was the easy part.

Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— your launch codes were actually related.
” After a moment of awkward silence, A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.
” That’s all you’ve got.
The trick is to put yourself in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities based on what they know or don’t know.
It means that B could conceivably have something with the potential to reveal A’s number, but isn’t guaranteed to.
Try factoring a few and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum.
For a number like 8, factoring it into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options.
Because the boss’s numbers must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities only has these 4 numbers.
Here’s where we can conclude a major clue.
5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become sums in multiple ways.
The need to consider this is one of the most difficult parts of this puzzle.
The crucial thing to remember is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number.
That ambiguity forces us to go through unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums can result from its factors, then break those apart and see what products can result.

In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, methodically scanning and sorting the wavelengths reflecting off the planet’s surface.
In fact, it was emanating from places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, northern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US were all ablaze.So, what was going on?
Plants and other organisms use light to grow by way of photosynthesis.
But that’s just one of three ways that light entering a photosynthetic organism is used.
And this is the key to solving the mystery.
To understand the others, we need to begin with photosynthesis.
During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s cells called chloroplasts, which are packed with chlorophyll pigments.
When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, some of their electrons become excited.
They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy into chemical energy.
This powers the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow.
Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried out by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen.
During photosynthesis, the chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series of chemical reactions.
It’s such a small amount that you can’t see it with the naked eye.
They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy into chemical energy.
Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried out by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen.
But plants regularly absorb more light than they’re able to consume.
For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't photosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed to a lot of sunlight.
If not dealt with, the excess light can damage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light is by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves.
The third way plants interact with incoming light is by radiating it back out at a different wavelength, producing what’s called chlorophyll fluorescence.
During photosynthesis, the chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series of chemical reactions.
But as some of the excited electrons fall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light.
Overall, about 1% of the light absorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red end of the spectrum.
It’s such a small amount that you can’t see it with the naked eye.
But plants the world over are fluorescing as they photosynthesize.
And this is what’s caused the Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite.
It was an accidental discovery, but a huge breakthrough.
Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence from space allows us to watch the planet breathe in real time— and monitor the health of ecosystems worldwide.
Previously, researchers used levels of greenness as the main estimate for plant health.
Because plants generally change colors or lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically indicate healthier plants.
But this measure can be unreliable.
In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence is a direct measure of photosynthetic activity.
It can help us infer how much oxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed in a given system.
Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence may also occur before visible signs of plant stress, making it a timely measure.
Scientists have already used chlorophyll fluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought in the Amazon and Great Plains.
Going forward, we’ll be investigating photosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support our silent friends, who already do so much for us.
The distinct forms of speech heard around Bremen, Germany and Interlaken, Switzerland are considered regional dialects of the German language.
And yet, when someone from Bremen is visiting the Swiss Alps, the conversations they hear between locals will likely be incomprehensible to them.
Similarly, outside of China, Mandarin and Cantonese are often referred to as Chinese dialects. But they’re even more dissimilar than Spanish and Italian.
On the other hand, speakers of Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, which are recognized as three distinct languages, can usually communicate in their native tongues with little difficulty.
And Turkish language soap operas, broadcast without dubbing or subtitles, are some of the most popular shows in Azeri-speaking Azerbaijan.
So, when is a form of speech considered a dialect versus a language?
It seems reasonable that the degree of mutual intelligibility would determine whether two ways of speaking are classified as separate languages or as dialects of the same language.
But as we've seen, there are many occasions where this is not the case.
Perhaps surprisingly, the distinction between a language and a dialect usually has nothing to do with pronunciation, vocabulary, or any other linguistic features.
However, it’s not coincidental, either.
It’s a matter of politics.
The basis for what’s officially deemed a language was shaped by the emergence of a European nation states beginning around the 1500s.
In order to establish and maintain centralized governments, clear territorial boundaries, and state-sponsored education systems, many nation states promoted a standardized language.
Which form of speech was chosen to be the standard language was usually based on what people spoke in the capital.
And while other forms of speech persisted, they were often treated as inferior.
This tradition extended across the globe with European colonization and into modern times.
Later on, in his attempt to establish a unified, fascist state, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini saw language standardization as an important objective.
” This way, languages are seen as groups of varieties.
Each has its own unique history and characteristic pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammatical structures.
In the United States, some people have cast AAVE as an incorrect or simplified version of mainstream US English.
Instead, many opt to call different forms of speech “varieties.
” This way, languages are seen as groups of varieties.
So the English language is made up of varieties including Standard British and American English, AAVE, Nigerian English, Malaysian English, and many others.
Human language, in all its cross-pollinating, ever-evolving glory, naturally resists the impulse to sort it into neat buckets.
Oftentimes, forms of speech exist on a kind of linguistic continuum where they overlap with others, and the differences between them are gradual— not clear cut.
And that’s the confounding beauty of the dynamic, diverse, and dazzling universe of human communication.
Every year, humans change 10 million hectares of land, and not for the better.
Right now, there are more than two billion hectares of degraded land around the world.
We need to fix this fast, and technology can help.
Restoration is an enormous, complex challenge.
Until now, we have been limited to poor facsimiles, like vast plantations of a single kind of tree.
But drones change that by allowing us to gather data and plant the right mix of vegetation quickly, at enormous scales.
And machine-learning analysis enables us to plan the planting and then monitor our restoration work.
For example, in Australia, we're using drone-based planting and ecology-trained AI to restore thousands of hectares of land mined for coal.
Not just planting trees, but bringing back biodiverse, complex ecosystems.
On a larger scale, native forests here in Australia have been decimated by catastrophic bushfires and land-clearing for agriculture.
This means diminished food sources and safe habitats for koalas.
A new project would allow us to accelerate the restoration of thousands of hectares of koala forests over the next few years.
With these combined technologies, we're able to scale up restoration from a small island to an entire continent.
We can return forests to land where a mine used to be, or recreate ecosystems like the one we're hoping to restore on Lord Howe Island, birthplace of one of the world's largest insects.
This unique island is plagued by imported species, where we're helping to eradicate the undesirable plants to allow endemic species to thrive.
It's not just billions of trees.
It's restoring nature in all its complexity and beauty.

MSG is a mixture of two common substances.
Ikeda Kikunae was trying to isolate the molecule responsible for a unique flavor he called “umami,” meaning “a pleasant, savory taste.” Today, umami is recognized as one of the five basic tastes in food science.
By isolating high quantities of glutamate from a bowl of noodle broth and combining them with another flavor enhancer like sodium, he created a seasoning that instantly increased the umami of any dish. The result was a major success.
By the 1930s, MSG was a kitchen staple across most of Asia; and by the mid-20th century, it could be found in commercial food production worldwide. So when Dr. Kwok's letter was published, the outrage was immediate.
Researchers and citizens demanded a scientific enquiry into the popular additive.
On one hand, this wasn’t unreasonable.
The substance hadn't been tested for toxicity, and its health impacts were largely unknown.
So what is this mysterious seasoning?
Where does it come from, and is it actually bad for you?

In 1980, two American professors bet $1,000 on a question with stakes that couldn’t be higher: would the earth run out of resources to sustain a growing human population?
One of them was Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich, who wrote the bestselling 1968 book, “The Population Bomb.
” The global population had grown rapidly since World War II, and Ehrlich predicted that millions would starve to death as the population increased faster than the food supply.
He drew from the ideas of 18th century economist Thomas Malthus and related work from the 20th century.
Malthus had posited that population growth, if unchecked over time, would always outpace food supply.
Through the 1970s, it seemed like Ehrlich was right: famines, pollution, and political unrest had many concerned that humanity was on the brink of such a crisis, and some governments considered and even implemented policies to limit population growth.
Betting against Ehrlich was Julian Simon, a professor of business and economics.
He analyzed historic data from around the world, and found no correlation between a growing population and a decrease in standards of living— in fact, he found the opposite.
He argued that Ehrlich’s work, and that of Malthus before him, was based on theoretical calculations, while the real-world data told a different story.
But then, he departed from the data himself, claiming human ingenuity would always find alternatives to compensate for diminishing resources.
If that seems overly optimistic to you, well, you're not alone.
Ehrlich and other experts found Simon’s claims preposterous.
In June 1980, Simon wrote a scathing article for Science Magazine that incited a heated debate of published articles between the two men.
Simon said he should have placed a wager against Ehrlich years before, when Ehrlich ventured that, “England would not exist in the year 2000.” Later that year, Simon called Ehrlich a false prophet and challenged him to a bet.
Their feud also touched on the debate about whether to prioritize environmental protections or economic growth, a key issue in the American presidential race between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.
After some debate, they set the final terms: $200 on the price of each of five metals. If the price of the metal decreased or held steady over the next decade, Simon won.
If the price increased, Ehrlich won.
Wait, what?
Weren’t we talking about overpopulation and famine?
What could the price of metals possibly have to do with that?
Well, the reality is that the price of metals may not have been the best choice— many factors impact these prices that have nothing to do with overpopulation.
But their reasoning was as follows: metals are finite natural resources used in all sorts of manufacturing.
Ehrlich believed a growing population would consume such finite resources, and scarcity would drive the prices up.
Simon thought humanity would find substitutes for the metals, and the prices would stay stable or even decrease.
So, what happened?
The world population continued to increase over the next 10 years, but the price of all five metals decreased, making Simon the clear winner of a bet that may not have been a great proxy for the question they were debating, anyway.
As for the question itself, today, their focus on overpopulation represent a snapshot of history.
Our understanding of what causes starvation and famine has progressed: we have the resources to support a growing human population, but we’re currently failing to distribute those resources equitably, and changing that should be our priority.
And we no longer see population size as a primary cause of environmental degradation and climate change, or limiting population growth as a viable solution to these problems.
Rather, experts largely agree that our focus should be on replacing unsustainable technologies and practices with sustainable ones, and that economic growth and environmental protections don’t have to be at odds.

A procession of segmented creatures moves across the sea floor.
Up ahead, hundreds have begun shedding their exoskeletons and piling on top of one another in what appears to be. . . a massive orgy.
But this is not some alien world.
It’s Earth about 500 million years ago, when these creatures, called trilobites, prospered.
Prevailing for around 270 million years and encompassing more than 20,000 distinct species, trilobites are some of the most successful lifeforms in Earth’s history.
When they sprung into existence, they were among the most diverse and sophisticated organisms Earth had yet seen.
And, as the earliest known animals with complex eyes, trilobites had a unique perspective on the ancient world.
For almost all of Earth’s history before the rise of the trilobites, life had mostly consisted of microscopic marine organisms.
But then, scientists think an increase in oxygen allowed multicellular lifeforms to extract more energy from their food and perform more complex functions.
This then enabled the rise of carnivores, which in turn spurred a productive arms race, resulting in what’s known as the Cambrian explosion.
Within about 20 million years, life had branched out to include most of the animal groups we know today.
Species ranged in length from a few millimeters to almost one meter and some were equipped with intriguing ornaments.
As a result, they filled many distinct niches over the ages.
Many trilobites plowed or burrowed into the sea floor while others swam freely.
Certain species had spines, horns, and even protruding tridents.
And their social behavior was complex: they came together to search for food, find safety in numbers, migrate and mate.
In fact, their fossilized conga lines represent some of the first evidence of animal group behaviour.
Like modern arthropods, trilobites had compound eyes composed of many tiny lenses.
But theirs were made of the mineral calcite, which also constituted their exoskeletons.
These lenses allowed trilobites to form sharp images and quickly sense changes in light.
Some had long eye stalks that helped them peep above the muddy sea floor as they burrowed beneath.
Others had large dragonfly-like eyes that they probably used to scour the ocean bottom as they swam upside-down in dim waters.
And some trilobites had pillar-like eyes that may have offered 360 degree views, along with structures that provided shade from overhead light.
Yet despite their dominance of the seas, trilobites were vulnerable to environmental changes and predators.
About 444 million years ago, Earth cooled and sea levels dropped, radically changing some of their habitats.
This was the beginning of what would prove to be the trilobite’s long demise.
Some 20 million years later, fish with jaws began sweeping the sea.
Trilobites developed spiky ornamentation and neat ways of locking their joints shut.
Many species could curl themselves into balls, entirely sealing their soft parts inside their hard exoskeletons.
Then, another extinction event shook the world.
Trilobite diversity dwindled, and come about 360 million years ago, only one of the 10 former trilobite orders remained.
Finally, rapid climate change spurred the greatest known mass extinction event in Earth's history.
This catastrophic period finished the trilobites off— along with approximately 96% of all marine species.
But trilobites left a remarkable record behind.
Their calcite exoskeletons made for hardy fossils that would remain intact for hundreds of millions of years to come.
We’ve found trilobite fossils on every single continent— many in unlikely environments that were once part of the ocean floor.
Trilobites have no direct descendants, but their evolutionary cousins are alive and well.
And since arthropods make up over 80% of current animal species, we might say that, although Earth may no longer be the planet of the trilobites, their distant relatives still reign supreme.A procession of segmented creatures moves across the sea floor.
Up ahead, hundreds have begun shedding their exoskeletons and piling on top of one another in what appears to be. . . a massive orgy.
But this is not some alien world.
It’s Earth about 500 million years ago, when these creatures, called trilobites, prospered.
Prevailing for around 270 million years and encompassing more than 20,000 distinct species, trilobites are some of the most successful lifeforms in Earth’s history.
When they sprung into existence, they were among the most diverse and sophisticated organisms Earth had yet seen.
And, as the earliest known animals with complex eyes, trilobites had a unique perspective on the ancient world.
For almost all of Earth’s history before the rise of the trilobites, life had mostly consisted of microscopic marine organisms.
But then, scientists think an increase in oxygen allowed multicellular lifeforms to extract more energy from their food and perform more complex functions.
This then enabled the rise of carnivores, which in turn spurred a productive arms race, resulting in what’s known as the Cambrian explosion.
Within about 20 million years, life had branched out to include most of the animal groups we know today.
Trilobites were an important part of this surge.
All trilobites had three lengthwise lobes, but building off the same basic components, they varied greatly.
Species ranged in length from a few millimeters to almost one meter and some were equipped with intriguing ornaments.
As a result, they filled many distinct niches over the ages.
Many trilobites plowed or burrowed into the sea floor while others swam freely.

Once every century, the world’s greatest spiders gather to compete in a series of grueling games. The winner will become the next arachnomonarch, able to command all the world’s spiders to their will. That day is today, and for the first time, you’re casting your name into the ring.
From Anansi to Arachne to Aragog, all of the titans of the spider world are here, and at first, no one even notices itsy-bitsy you.
But after wowing the crowd with your web design and sticking it to the competition in the long-distance sling, you’ve qualified for the finals.
Now all that remains is to face off against the reigning champion, Queen Shelob, on the Whirled Wide Web, and win the title from her.
In 2011, a group of researchers conducted a scientific study to find an impossible result: that listening to certain songs can make you younger.
Their study involved real people, truthfully reported data, and commonplace statistical analyses.
So how did they do it?
The answer lies in a statistical method scientists often use to try to figure out whether their results mean something or if they’re random noise.
In fact, the whole point of the music study was to point out ways this method can be misused.
A famous thought experiment explains the method: there are eight cups of tea, four with the milk added first, and four with the tea added first.
A participant must determine which are which according to taste. There are 70 different ways the cups can be sorted into two groups of four, and only one is correct.
So, can she taste the difference?
That’s our research question.
To analyze her choices, we define what’s called a null hypothesis: that she can’t distinguish the teas.
If she can’t distinguish the teas, she’ll still get the right answer 1 in 70 times by chance. 1 in 70 is roughly .
014. That single number is called a p-value.
In many fields, a p-value of . 05 or below is considered statistically significant, meaning there’s enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Based on a p-value of . 014, they’d rule out the null hypothesis that she can’t distinguish the teas.
Though p-values are commonly used by both researchers and journals to evaluate scientific results, they’re really confusing, even for many scientists.
That’s partly because all a p-value actually tells us is the probability of getting a certain result, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
So if she correctly sorts the teas, the p-value is the probability of her doing so assuming she can’t tell the difference.
But the reverse isn’t true: the p-value doesn’t tell us the probability that she can taste the difference, which is what we’re trying to find out.
So if a p-value doesn’t answer the research question, why does the scientific community use it?
Well, because even though a p-value doesn’t directly state the probability that the results are due to random chance, it usually gives a pretty reliable indication.
At least, it does when used correctly.
And that’s where many researchers, and even whole fields, have run into trouble.
Scientists can test their research question in multiple ways, and some of these tests might produce a statistically significant result, while others don’t.
It might seem like a good idea to test every possibility.
But it’s not, because with each additional test, the chance of a false positive increases.
Searching for a low p-value, and then presenting only that analysis, is often called p-hacking.
It’s like throwing darts until you hit a bullseye and then saying you only threw the dart that hit the bull’s eye.
This is exactly what the music researchers did.
They played three groups of participants each a different song and collected lots of information about them.
The analysis they published included only two out of the three groups.
Of all the information they collected, their analysis only used participants’ fathers’ age— to “control for variation in baseline age across participants.
” They also paused their experiment after every ten participants, and continued if the p-value was above . 05, but stopped when it dipped below .
Fortunately, there’s a simple way to make p-values more reliable: pre-registering a detailed plan for the experiment and analysis beforehand that others can check, so researchers can’t keep trying different analyses until they find a significant result.
And, in the true spirit of scientific inquiry, there’s even a new field that’s basically science doing science on itself: studying scientific practices in order to improve them.
What if I told you that the pandemic will save the lives of millions of people?
It's a difficult thing to consider, given how many loved ones we've already lost.
But throughout the course of human history, massive public health crises have resulted in innovation in health care and technology. For example, the Black Death gave rise to the Gutenberg press and the 1918 flu pandemic led to modern vaccine technology.
The COVID-19 pandemic has and will be no different.
Fortunately, we got around that problem just in time, and I'd like to tell you about the technology that we use to do it. When mRNA is administered, it's injected into our muscles or our bloodstream, but we actually need it to go inside of our cells.
It needs protection, and it needs to be told where to go. And that's where I come in.
Let me tell you what they are and how they work.
So first of all, "nano" just means really, really small. Think of how small a person is compared to the diameter of the earth.
That's how small a nanoparticle is compared to the person.
These nanoparticles are made up of several fatty molecules called lipids.
Fat is an awesome packing material -- nice and bouncy. Interestingly, our cells are also surrounded by fat to keep them flexible and protected.
Years ago, scientists had the idea to create lipid nanoparticles that would act like a Trojan horse.
Because the lipids in the nanoparticle look similar to the membranes that surround our cells, the cells are willing to bring the nanoparticle inside, and that's when the mRNA is released into the cell.
So what, exactly, are the lipids in these nanoparticles?
There are four ingredients in addition to the mRNA, and I'll tell you about each one. First, there's a lipid called a phospholipid.
This is the primary ingredient in our cell membranes, which are the walls of fat that separate the insides of our cells from everything that surrounds them. Phospholipids have a head that likes water and a tail that likes other fatty things.
So when you throw a bunch of phospholipids together in water, they form this beautiful structure called a lipid bilayer.
Here, the heads face the inside and the outside of the cell, which is water, and the fat-loving parts of the molecule hang out together in the middle. In lipid nanoparticles, phospholipids have a similar role of keeping all of the other ingredients organized.
Second, there's a lipid called cholesterol.
Why, if cholesterol has a bad reputation, would we want to use it in a therapeutic nanoparticle?
It turns out that while cholesterol can be bad when it's in our bloodstream, it's actually a really good thing for our cell membranes. And that's because those phospholipids I just told you about, they are entirely too free with themselves, and they are prone to falling apart.
Third, there's a lipid called an ionizable lipid.
Here, "ionizable" means that when these particles are in the bloodstream, they're neutrally charged, which helps with their safety.
Then they switch to a positive charge inside of our cells, which helps them release the mRNA.
Ionizable lipids are special because they have to be made in the lab, and scientists around the world have tested tens of thousands of these materials to find ones that are good at delivering mRNA safely.
Finally, one more ingredient. This one is a polymer called polyethylene glycol.
So let's call it PEG. That's much easier.
PEG is a water-loving molecule.
So it surrounds the lipid nanoparticle and it holds it all together.
You can think of the other three lipids as the box and the bubble wrap for the mRNA, and the PEG as the packing tape.
You may have heard in the news about a tiny fraction of people that have allergic responses to the vaccine.
There is some evidence that PEG could be contributing to these allergic reactions. And that's because people are routinely exposed to PEG in cosmetic and household products, and some people have already developed antibodies against PEG.
But why would this happen to some people and not to others?
It turns out that every person's immune system is different, and just the same way that some people are allergic to latex, other people are allergic to PEG.
When these ingredients all fit together nicely, the result is a deliverywoman's dream.
In the case of the vaccines, after these nanoparticles get injected into our muscle, they take the mRNA into our cells.
But here's the best part: for mRNA therapeutics, these vaccines are only the beginning.
mRNA can be used to treat or cure many diseases. So in the future, we will likely have treatments for many terrible diseases, including cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia.
And then, if we're lucky, we'll have vaccines against some of the most deadly and feared pathogens across the globe, including malaria, Ebola and HIV.
Some of these products are already in clinical trials, and the success of the COVID-19 vaccines will pave the way for future generations of these therapies.
This is how the pandemic will save the lives of millions.
It catalyzed the most rapid vaccine development in history and brought to life a niche, previously unapproved form of technology.
And in our desperation, we gave that technology a chance.
Now we're collecting long-term safety and efficacy data from hundreds of millions of people.
And with these data, interest in the technology, funding for the technology and trust in the technology will continue to grow.
Looking ahead, the packaging and delivery of mRNA to the right organs and tissues will continue to be one of the most significant challenges to implementing this technology.
And so my colleagues and I are going to be busy for a very long time.
Ultimately, I'm here with a message of hope.
We are on the cusp of a revolution.
mRNA is about to change the world forever, and it's all thanks to these fatty little balls that take this miracle medicine to exactly where it's needed. Thank you. (Applause)
Nearly three millennia ago, a Babylonian tablet described a curious illness called miqtu.
Said to cause symptoms ranging from facial twitching to full body convulsions, the Babylonians believed those afflicted were possessed by evil spirits, and the only treatment was divine intervention.
Today, we know the symptoms of miqtu by another name, and modern medicine has developed numerous treatments for those experiencing seizures.
But these ancient afflictions still hold a surprising number of secrets.
Doctors define a seizure as any set of symptoms resulting from excess electrical activity in the brain.
But regardless of the underlying conditions that cause them, every seizure begins here.
If they believed the seizure was caused by bleeding in the skull, they sometimes employed a technique called trepanation.
Could the next year bring a change in luck?
Eventually, she reciprocates, and they swim around in circles before doing the deed.
The male platypus has a penis with eccentric features like two heads and spines that aid and fertilization.
Over the following week, the female constructs an extensive burrow furnished with a cozy nest.
She plugs up the tunnels leading in, making them appear as dead ends to potential predators.
Then, much like a reptile or bird, she lays eggs from her cloaca, a single opening that's used for both reproduction and excretion.
She incubates her eggs, and as the river red gum tree blooms, her offspring hatch.
Like other mammals, she feeds them milk.
But unlike other mammals, she has no nipples.
Instead, her milk oozes from mammary glands onto her belly, where her babies slurp it up.
This pooled milk invites bacteria, but the platypus also produces potent antibacterial proteins, ensuring her newborns are safe.
She continues nursing them for four months— hunting, evading the fox, and repairing her burrow all the while.
By the time her young are ready to make their debut, the summer is waning.
One evening, after the female platypus returns from hunting, she finds that one nestling has already struck off on its own.
A few days later, the other also leaves the borough.
Soon, her young are living completely independently.
And eventually they’ll leave this part of the river to make homes of their own.
On a small island in the middle of the Irish Sea, fortresses preside over the rugged shores. This unlikely location was the birthplace of a medieval empire that lasted 200 years, ruled by a dynasty of sea kings.
The first of these kings was Godred Crovan, a notorious warlord descended from Irish and Viking rulers.
[Baby cooing] What if I was to tell you that a game of peekaboo could change the world?
Sounds impossible, right?
Well, I’m here today to prove it’s not.
Hi, I’m Molly and I’m seven.
And this is my little friend, Ari.
Say “Hi,” Ari. Hi. Oh, and this is my neighbor, Amarjot.
He has to take Ari away now to get ready for our experiment.
But don't worry, they'll be back.
My talk today is about some powerful things you grownups can do.
Because my parents and people around me did them early and often.
I know not all kids are as lucky.
Some of my friends, some kids at my school and many around the world.
And I would really like to help change that.
Thanks to scientists, we now know just how important the first five years are for our health and development, especially our brains.
Ari started learning long before he was even born, from inside his mommy’s tummy.
When Ari was born, he was tiny and he cried all the time.
He was always hungry and he pooped a lot.
[Laughter] Now he laughs and giggles and makes funny noises.
But those are just the changes we hear and see.
That’s way more going on inside.
So, let’s talk more about our brains.
The blue bag is a rough size and weight of a healthy baby’s brain at birth.
The red one is a baby’s brain after the first year.
It almost doubles in volume.
And by my age, it's almost 90 percent the volume of an adult brain.
Our brains develop faster in our early years than at any other time in our lives.
It can create up to one million neural connections every second.
But we need your help.
Our healthy development depends on these top five things, One, connecting; two, talking; three, playing; four, a healthy home, five; community.
All of this helps our brains and us reach our full potential.
So what’s something you can do that can really make a difference?
Scientists call it serve and return.
That’s just a grown-up way of saying connect, talk and play with us.
And here’s the really big news.
Amarjot, Ari, you ready?
(Audio) Amajat: Ready?
Molly Wright: Copycat games build imagination and empathy.
(Amarjot and Ari laughing) Naming games build vocabulary and attention.
Amarjot: Daddy. Ari. Daddy. Ari. MW: And games like peekabo -- yep, peekaboo -- actually build memory and trust.
Amarjot: Peekaboo!
Interactions early and often matter.
Take it from me, the seven-year-old up here talking about brain science.
(Laughter) OK, now let’s see what happens when the connection is taken away.
So now he’s trying to get his dad’s attention again.
He’s reaching out like, “That was fun, why have you stopped?
” (Ari cries) I know it’s important for adults to use their devices sometimes, but kids are hardwired to seek out meaningful connections, not receiving them causes confusion and stress.
OK, Amarjot, please re-engage.
Amarjot: Ah, there’s Ari.
(Ari laughs) MW: Now what if our whole childhood was like that last 30 seconds?
How hard it would be for a child to feel calm.
To feel safe.
To learn to trust anyone.
And the lifelong impact that would have.
That makes me feel sad.
Ari only reacted the way he did and recovered so quickly because the connection between him and his dad is usually so strong.
The positive relationships with the grown-ups in our lives gives kids the confidence we need to try new things, to explore and be a kid.
So please, try to remember the most special period for our development is the first five years.
Starting from inside mommy’s tummy.
What’s something really impactful you can do?
Serve and return.
And when?
Early and often.
Please give it up for a Amarjot and Ari.
To us, the children, it’s so much more than just a game.
It's our future.
Thank you.
(Applause) See?
Peekaboo really can change the world.
(Applause)
I’m here, in the heart of London’s financial district, the Square Mile.
This is the area where I worked at the start of my investment-banking career in the ’90s, as a fresh-faced youth.
But if you told me then that I would end up as COP26 president, I think I’d have asked you what COP26 was.
It’s the 26th United Nations climate conference and it’s taking place in the UK.
But forget the technical terms.
What COP26 really stands for is our last chance to avoid the worst effects of climate change. And I’ll come back to that later.
I remember being on a flight in the late 2000s and watching Al Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth. ” And I rarely watch an entire film, but this one I watched twice on the same flight.
And I remember sitting on the plane afterwards thinking about my young daughters and what future I wanted for them.
And I think about that injustice a lot.
Really a lot.
And that journey that I’ve made is just one example of a much broader shift over the past 30 years. One that has seen climate move from the margins to the mainstream in business, in government, in finance and indeed amongst the public.
And it’s that shift that makes me hopeful on climate, despite the scale of the challenge that we face, which frankly is huge. Now, the science shows that to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we must limit the rise in average global temperature to 1.5 degrees centigrade.
That if temperatures rise higher, the risk of species extinction and catastrophic impacts on human lives increases dramatically.
And we risk kickstarting feedback loops with the consequences of climate change, like melting permafrost, release even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, making it even harder to wrestle the crisis under control.
Now, to keep 1.5-degree limits alive, we’ve got to halve global emissions by 2030. That’s right, halve.
That is a huge undertaking.
And everywhere I see the same passion and the commitment to act on climate.
Companies in every sector are throwing themselves behind a clean, green future, and rocketing public concern is encouraging governments and businesses to act. And shareholders, they’re forcing companies to change.
And the move to clean technology is accelerating faster than anyone anticipated. I mean, let’s take the sale of clean cars and vans that outstripping predictions. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal and gas in most of the world.
And three times as much solar power was built in 2020 than analysts predicted just back in 2015. In my old industry, finance, climate is now mainstream, too.
And there is a simple reason for that.
Investors try to predict the future.
Because if you can do that, you can make money.
And increasingly, they think the future is green.
More and more financial firms are committing to make their investments consistent with a 1.5-degree world.
And investors are asking for much higher returns from coal power than they are from renewables because they’re worried that coal power stations are going to become worthless.
In February 2020, when I helped launch our COP26 finance campaign here in the Square Mile to get finance moving to climate action, the place was packed to the rafters. You know, when I worked in banking, certainly at the start, the room would have been near empty.
Our challenge is that it’s not going fast enough.
Limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees requires us to move much faster.
And we can only succeed if we act now and we work together to speed up the shift to our green future.
And that’s what COP26 really stands for.
Now, in the run up to the conference and at the conference itself, we need governments to take the lead and get the green transition moving faster to keep 1.5 degrees alive.
We need them to set targets to reduce emissions, to make this the COP that consigns coal power to history where it belongs.
The COP that signals the end of polluting vehicles, the COP that calls time on deforestation.
We need developed countries to deliver the finance they have promised developing countries.
And we need to help protect people and nature from the impact of our changing climate.
And we need to work together as one planet to agree how we’re going to meet the scale of the climate challenge and to get every sector going green.
Now, this isn’t going to be easy.
First, because our understanding of the climate is developing all the time.
And as the science tells us, we need to move faster.
We're going to have to respond.
Second, getting people to agree can be challenging.
And at COP26, we have almost 200 countries.
And although the UK is leading this process, it’s up to all of us to find solutions together.
It’s like hosting a disco, a bop.
And look, I apologize that these terms show my age, but you can get a hall and you can hire a DJ, but to make it work, your friends have to turn up and dance.
And so it will be tough, but we simply cannot afford to fail.
The stakes are just too high.
And when ex-bankers like me lie awake thinking about climate change, when activists and businesses around the world have moved climate to the mainstream, we can all be hopeful.
A green revolution is on the march.
The clean future is within our grasp, but we need to actively pull it forward.
And we need world leaders to take this chance to turn hope into certainty, to mold the future, to come together at COP26, and to continue my disco analogy, dance.

A green industrial revolution is underway, taking us to a clean future, showing that we can create jobs and prosperity without harming the planet.
Our challenge is that it’s not going fast enough.

In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic rocked economies worldwide.
Millions of people lost their jobs, and many businesses struggled to survive or shut down completely.
Governments responded with some of the largest economic relief packages in history— the United States alone spent $2.2 trillion on a first round of relief.
So where did all this money come from?
Most countries have a central bank that manages the money supply and is independent from the government to prevent political interference.
The government can implement many types of economic policy, like decreasing people's taxes and creating jobs through public infrastructure projects, but it actually can’t just increase the money supply.
The central bank determines how much money is in circulation at a time.
So why can’t central banks authorize the printing of unlimited money to help an economy in crisis?
They could, but that’s a short-term solution that doesn’t necessarily boost economic growth in the long-term, and can actually hurt the economy.
Why?
With more money in circulation, manufacturers of goods like food, clothing, and cars could respond to demand simply by raising prices, rather than manufacturing more of these goods and creating new jobs in the process.
This would mean you could no longer buy as much with the same amount of money— a situation known as inflation.
A little bit of inflation, about 2% a year, is considered a sign of economic health, but more can quickly derail an economy.
In recent decades, central banks have tried an approach called quantitative easing to infuse the economy with cash while maintaining a low risk of severe inflation.
In this approach, a central bank increases cash flow by purchasing another entity’s bonds.
Anyone can buy bonds from corporations or governments.
When you buy a bond, you’re essentially loaning money to the company— or government— with the promise that they’ll pay it back later with interest.
This is why buying bonds is sometimes referred to as buying debt.
Both during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and again in 2020, the United States’ central bank, the Federal Reserve, bought bonds from the US government called treasury bonds.
Historically, many people have purchased these bonds as a safe form of investment, knowing the US government will pay them back with interest.
In early 2020, the Federal Reserve pledged to buy unlimited treasury bonds, loaning the U. S. government an unprecedented amount of money— cash that the government used to fund relief efforts like stimulus checks and unemployment benefits.
This isn’t equivalent to simply printing money, though it may sound similar.
Because of the way bonds are priced, by buying so many, the Federal Reserve effectively lowered the return on them, which incentivizes other investors to lend to riskier entities— like small and midsize companies— in order to get a decent return.
Encouraging lending this way should help companies of all sizes borrow money to funnel into projects and hires, boosting the economy over time in addition to helping the government supply people with urgently needed cash in the short term.
The Federal Reserve’s pledge to buy unlimited government debt has raised some questions— and eyebrows.
In theory, this means the government could issue more bonds, which the central bank would purchase.
The government could then use the money from the new bonds to pay off the old bonds, effectively meaning the government never pays back its debt to the central bank.
Citing this and other theoretical scenarios, some economists have raised concerns that a central bank buying government debt is a subversion of a system designed to protect the economy.
Others have insisted these measures are necessary, and have so far helped stabilize economies.
Though quantitative easing has become a lot more common in recent years, it’s still relatively new, and potential consequences are still unfolding.
We live in a culture that doesn't take mental health issues seriously.
It's Dr.Jen, and I've noticed something with my patients.They often describe to me some classic symptoms of an anxiety disorder.
Constant worry, trouble sleeping, tense muscles and struggle with concentrating.
But they aren't getting treatment.
There's a lot of issues with mental-health care in this country.
Some people don't have insurance that would cover it.
Some have been dismissed or minimized in the past, and don't think seeking help will do any good.
Some worry about the stigma and whether it could affect future jobs or relationships.
But severe anxiety isn't a moral or personal failing.
It's a health problem, just like strep throat or diabetes.
It needs to be treated with the same kind of seriousness.
Before we can talk about anxiety disorders, let's talk about anxiety itself. Anxiety is the very real and normal emotion we feel in a stressful situation.
It's related to fear.
But while fear is a response to an immediate threat that quickly subsides, anxiety is a response to more uncertain threats that tends to last much longer.
It's all part of the threat detection system, which all animals have to some degree, to help protect us from predators.
Anxiety starts in the brain's amygdala, a pair of almond-sized nerve bundles that alert other areas of the brain to be ready for defensive action.
Next, the hypothalamus relays the signal, setting off what we call the stress response in our body.
Our muscles tense, our breathing and heart rate increase and our blood pressure rises.
Areas in the brain stem kick in and put you in a state of high alertness.
This is the fight-or-flight response.
There are ways the fight-or-flight response is kept somewhat in check, with an area of higher-level thinking called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
It works like this. If a person sees something they think is dangerous, like a tiger, that sends a signal to the amygdala, saying "it's time to run.
" The ventromedial prefrontal cortex can say to the amygdala, "Hey, look.
They can't escape from a cage.
It's OK to calm down. " It's a feedback loop that can help keep the response in check. The hippocampus is also involved.
It provides context, saying things like, "Hey, we've seen tigers in cages before.
We're in a zoo.
You are extra safe.
" With anxiety, these threat-detection systems and mechanisms that reduce or inhibit them are functioning incorrectly and cause us to worry about the future and our safety in it.
But for many people, it goes into overdrive.
They experience persistent pervasive anxiety that disrupts work, school and relationships and leads them to avoid situations that may trigger symptoms. Anxiety disorders are not at all uncommon.
Based on data from the World Mental Health Survey, researchers estimate that about 16 percent of individuals currently have or have had an anxiety disorder.
These include social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia and phobias.
Studies have shown that people with anxiety disorders don't just have a different way of reacting to stress.
There may be actual differences in how their brain is working.
One model describes possible mix-ups in the connections between the amygdala and other parts of the brain.
The pathways that signal anxiety become stronger.
And the more anxiety you have, the stronger the pathways become, and it becomes a vicious cycle.
The good news is there's treatment for anxiety, and that you don't have to suffer.
Remember, this isn't about weakness.
It's about changing brain patterns, and research shows that our brains have the ability to reorganize and form new connections all throughout our lives. A good first step is to do the basics.
Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly and get plenty of sleep, as your mind is part of your body.
It might also help to try meditation.
Instead of our heart rate rising and our body tensing, with mindfulness and breathing, we can slow down the fight-or-flight response and improve how we feel in the moment.
Cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of talk therapy, can also be fantastic.
In it, you learn to identify upsetting thoughts and determine whether they're realistic.
Over time, cognitive behavioral therapy can rebuild those neural pathways that tamp down the anxiety response.
Medication can also give relief, in both the short-term and the long-term.
In the short-term, anti-anxiety drugs can down-regulate the threat-detection mechanisms that are going into overdrive.
Studies have shown that both long-term medications and cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce that overreactivity of the amygdala we see an anxiety disorders.
High blood pressure and diabetes, they can be treated or managed over time.
And the same is true for an anxiety disorder too.
In Warsaw, late October 1943, Irena Sendler and Janina Grabowska were enjoying a rare moment of peace in their war-torn city.
But their laughter froze when they heard the Gestapo pounding on Sendler’s door.
Sendler rushed to the window to dispose of incriminating evidence— only to see more police patrolling below.
Knowing she was minutes from arrest, she tossed Janina her most dangerous possession: a glass jar containing the names of over 2,000 Jewish children she’d smuggled to safety.
This arrest wasn’t the first consequence Sendler had faced in her lifelong crusade against anti-Semitism.
Born to Catholic parents in 1910, she grew up in a predominantly Jewish town where her father treated poor Jewish patients other doctors refused to help.
Irena was furious at the constant discrimination against her Jewish friends.
As a graduate student in social welfare at the University of Warsaw, Sendler publicly denounced the segregation of classrooms and defaced her non-Jewish identity card— earning her a suspension and a reputation for troublemaking.
Buoyed by her socialist ideals and inspired by her fellow social workers, Sendler assisted vulnerable Jewish families across Warsaw, pushing back on the waves of anti-Semitism surging through Europe.
But in September 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, bringing laws that further eroded Jewish rights.
In 1940, Hitler announced that hundreds of thousands of Jews in Warsaw were to be forced into just over one square mile of land.
Appalled, Sendler and her colleagues secured passes to the ghetto on the pretense of checking for typhus outbreaks.
In June 1947, the British viceroy announced that India would gain independence by August, and be partitioned into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan— but gave little explanation of how exactly this would happen.
Using outdated maps, inaccurate census numbers and minimal knowledge of the land, in a mere five weeks, the Boundary Committee drew a border dividing three provinces under direct British rule: Bengal, Punjab, and Assam.
The border took into account where Hindus and Muslims were majorities, but also factors like location and population percentages.
So if a Hindu majority area bordered another Hindu majority area, it would be included in India— but if a Hindu majority area bordered Muslim majority areas, it might become part of Pakistan.
Princely states on the border had to choose which of the new nations to join, losing their sovereignty in the process.
While the Boundary Committee worked on the new map, Hindus and Muslims began moving to areas where they thought they’d be a part of the religious majority— but they couldn’t be sure.
Families divided themselves.
Fearing sexual violence, parents sent young daughters and wives to regions they perceived to be safe.
The new map wasn’t revealed until August 17th, 1947— two days after independence.
The provinces of Punjab and Bengal became the geographically separated East and West Pakistan.
The rest became Hindu-majority India.
In a period of two years, millions of Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan left for India, while Muslims living in India fled villages where their families had lived for centuries.
The cities of Lahore, Delhi, Calcutta, Dhaka, and Karachi emptied of old residents and filled with refugees.
In the power vacuum British forces left behind, radicalized militias and local groups massacred migrants.
Much of the violence occurred in Punjab, and women bore the brunt of it, suffering rape and mutilation.
Around 100,000 women were kidnapped and forced to marry their captors.
The problems created by Partition went far beyond this immediate deadly aftermath.
Many families who made temporary moves became permanently displaced, and borders continue to be disputed.
[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE] Society has a set of stories it tells itself about who refugees are and what they look like. But let me tell you a different story. My story.
A samurai is found dead in a quiet bamboo grove.
One by one, the crime’s only known witnesses recount their version of the events that transpired.
But as they each tell their tale, it becomes clear that every testimony is plausible, yet different.
And each witness implicates themselves.
This is the premise of “In a Grove,” a short story published in the early 1920s by Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa.
Though many know this tale of warring perspectives by a different name: “Rashomon.
” In 1950, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa adapted two of Akutagawa’s stories into one film.
This movie introduced the world to an enduring cultural metaphor that has transformed our understanding of truth, justice and human memory.
The Rashomon effect describes a situation in which individuals give significantly different but equally conceivable accounts of the same event.
Often used to highlight the unreliability of eyewitnesses, the Rashomon effect usually occurs under two specific conditions.
The first: there’s no evidence to verify what really happened. And the second: there’s pressure to achieve closure, often provided by an authority figure trying to identify the definitive truth.
But the Rashomon effect undermines the very idea of a singular, objective truth.
In the source material, Akutagawa and Kurosawa use the tools of their media to give each character’s testimony equal weight, transforming each witness into an unreliable narrator.
Without any hints on who’s sharing the most accurate account, the audience can’t tell which character to trust.
Instead, each testimony takes on a truthful quality, and the audience is left doubting their convictions as they guess who ended the samurai’s life.
Some might find this frustrating because the plot subverts expectations of how mysteries usually end.
But by refusing to provide a clear answer, these two artists capture the messiness and complexity of truth and human memory.
Neuroscientists have found that when we form a memory, our interpretation of visual information is influenced by our previous experiences and internal biases.
Some of these biases are unique to individuals, but others are more universal.
For example, egocentric bias can influence people to subconsciously reshape their memories in ways that cast a positive light on their actions.
Even if we were able to encode a memory accurately, recalling it incorporates new information that changes the memory.
And when we later recall that event, we typically remember the embellished memory instead of the original experience.
These underlying psychological phenomena mean that the Rashomon effect can pop up anywhere.
In biology, scientists starting from the same dataset and applying the same analytical methods, frequently publish different results.
In one famous case, two anthropologists visited the Mexican village of Tepoztlan.
Experts aside, the Rashomon effect can also impact the general public, particularly when it comes to the perception of complicated world events.
Some stated that it had gone smoothly, while others called it a complete failure.
Are there situations when an “objective truth” doesn’t exist?
What can different versions of the same event tell us about the time, place and people involved?
And how can we make group decisions if we’re all working with different information, backgrounds, and biases?
But the enduring importance of Akutagawa’s story suggests there may be value in embracing the ambiguity.
(Music) [Body Stuff with Dr. Jen Gunter] When we focus on milk, we lose the bigger picture of bone health.
One estimate is enough bone is removed and replaced that a new skeleton is made every 10 years.
When we think of calcium and vitamin D, many of us picture a frosty glass of milk.
But scientists have developed some working hypotheses.
It seems that, millions of years ago in Africa, early hominins first transitioned out of trees and adopted a more active lifestyle.
Keeping cool became increasingly important.
Eventually, they developed more sweat glands, which helped them lose heat by evaporating moisture through the skin.
In fact, humans have 10 times more sweat glands than chimpanzees, for instance.
But efficiently losing heat by sweating is harder to do when you’re covered in fur.
Scientists believe that early humans lost much of their coat around this time to help their sweat evaporate faster.
However, if losing our hair was so advantageous, why do we have any left at all?
It seems that there are unique uses for hair in different parts of our bodies. When it comes to the tops of our heads, temperature regulation likely played a part again.
Since early humans began venturing into the open, their heads would’ve been exposed to the scorching sun.
Thicker, longer-growing hair protects our sensitive scalps and keeps our brains from overheating.
Dark tightly curled hair is most effective at keeping solar radiation off of skin.
Other kinds of head hair evolved as humans moved to different places.
Meanwhile, researchers think eyebrows are especially useful for communication because they sit atop active facial muscles that convey our feelings.
Eyelashes have been shown to minimize airflow over our eyeballs, preventing them from drying out and catching debris.
And maybe facial hair proved helpful in distinguishing identity from a distance, but we really don’t know.
Evidence is stubbly at best.
Why we have hair in other regions is. . . more pungent.
Our armpits, nipples, and pubic areas are dotted with apocrine glands.
They produce oily, smelly secretions which the thick, curly hair that often grows in these spots helps disperse.
The secretions that waft off these hairy patches may be useful for identification.
For example, several studies have shown that people are able to identify their own armpit odors as well as those of people they’re close with.
The final type of notable human hair is the vellus hair that covers our bodies.
We don't know if these hairs serve any purpose themselves, but the follicles vellus hair grows from are essential banks of stem cells that repair damaged skin after injury.
They’re also important sites of nerve endings that convey signals of gentle touch to the brain.
In fact, although it’s much finer, humans have roughly the same density of body hair as apes of comparable sizes.
So despite all this talk of human nakedness, we're not actually as hairless as we look.
The Trojan War has been raging for 10 years, with neither Greeks nor Trojans prevailing. Gods and humans alike are desperate for a break, so when a divine omen races across the sky, the two sides agree to a 10 day truce.
From high up on Olympus you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to bring this bloody war to its conclusion.
When you go to consult the Fates, they advise: should the peace last for a full 10 days, all will end soon.
However, if the truce is broken, the ensuing battle will lead to 10 more devastating years of war.
The Fates’ loom has shown them the exact conditions that will keep the truce intact.
Anyone can move to a horizontally or vertically adjacent camp, but never diagonally.
The problem is, they’re currently arranged like this.
Tonight, you can use your powers to swap up to six pairs of camps that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first insight here is to divide this into two sub-problems.
There’s the matter of connecting 4 clumps of Greeks without putting holes in the Trojan line.
And then there’s dealing with the thorny center space.
Let’s consider the Greeks first.
To connect any Greek clumps, you’ll have to mess with the nice, straight Trojan lines.
If you try to do that anywhere in the center of these arms, you'll create new isolated clusters of Trojans.
So the only option is to go to the perimeter of the field and move some Trojans diagonally, say here, here, and here. Now for the center.
there’s no way to connect the Trojan arms without swapping a Trojan in.
But continuing to shift that arm of Trojans inward would require moving the same Greek camp multiple times.
However, you could shift the whole Trojan arm up and to the right, closing this gap. There are several solutions with slight variants, but as long as you perform this maneuver on the short arm of Trojans, you can achieve peace in exactly 6 moves.
You make the swaps and all is well until the fifth night.
One of your rival gods wants to see the bloodshed continue, and has taken advantage of a forgotten prophecy.
He’s convinced one Trojan camp to make a swap with their horizontal, vertical, or diagonal Greek neighbors that will break up the Greek connectivity.
Once again, you consult the Fates, who prophesize the following: the meddling Trojan camp is somewhere within four grid spaces of the perimeter of the battlefield.
They won’t go through with a swap if it only breaks up Trojan connectivity.
And finally, you can make at most two swaps with the same rules as before to thwart them.
Which swaps do you make to block the troublesome Trojan camp?
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You won't be able to identify the scheming camp precisely, but there’s a lot you can do to at least narrow down the options.
They have to be somewhere in this area.
And they have to be able to block Greek camps from each other in a single swap.
That doesn’t leave many options; the only possible blockages are at the end of these two arms, where a Trojan camp could plug a hole without opening a new one.
So they must be in one of these four camps.
Let’s look at the right arm first.
There’s a threat here because this column has two Trojan camps.
If one moves to the right, the other will still be in place, blocking Greeks from crossing.
so we can thwart them by moving either one a column left into this square.
and the same principle applies to the bottom arm.
Your effort maintains the peace for the final 5 days.
From high up on Olympus you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to bring this bloody war to its conclusion.

What would the world look like if extreme climate change becomes reality?
Well, here's just one example.
If temperatures were to rise by three more degrees Celsius, Shanghai, a city of 24 million people in China, will be wiped off the map.
In June 2019, temperatures in Churu, India, exceeded 120 degrees Fahrenheit, to the point that the government warned citizens to avoid drinking coffee, tea and alcohol out of fear of overheating.
Heat waves are becoming more severe and commonplace due to climate change, projected to lead to deaths at the same rate as all infectious diseases combined.
This map here shows the increase in the severity and prevalence of heat waves if the world follows a moderate warming scenario.
By 2050, summertime highs of 95 degrees Fahrenheit, or 35 degrees Celsius, will become the new normal in nearly 1,000 cities, triple the number of cities that currently experience these sweltering temperatures.
" Here in Singapore, downtown neighborhoods can be as much as seven degrees Celsius, or 13 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than the rainforests that were once here.
While it's true that cities are contributing to climate change, they're also key actors in forging low carbon emission pathways.
In dense cities like New York City and Tokyo, for instance, the average resident is responsible for over two tons of carbon dioxide emissions per capita.
We observe these neighborhood-level disparities particularly clearly in these side-by-side images of Los Angeles, comparing income on the left and tree cover on the right.
Green spaces are often public spaces, and they're known to be associated with social and economic well-being.
Take a look at this map of my hometown of Greenville, South Carolina. Unlike the name suggests it is not green for everyone.
To address these inequalities, cities are starting to strategize and develop plans that can ensure that climate benefits are provided to all of their citizens equally.
If temperatures were to rise by three more degrees Celsius, Shanghai, a city of 24 million people in China, will be wiped off the map.
Cities all throughout the world experienced record-setting summer temperatures.
In June 2019, temperatures in Churu, India, exceeded 120 degrees Fahrenheit, to the point that the government warned citizens to avoid drinking coffee, tea and alcohol out of fear of overheating.
Heat waves are becoming more severe and commonplace due to climate change, projected to lead to deaths at the same rate as all infectious diseases combined.
This map here shows the increase in the severity and prevalence of heat waves if the world follows a moderate warming scenario.
By 2050, summertime highs of 95 degrees Fahrenheit, or 35 degrees Celsius, will become the new normal in nearly 1,000 cities, triple the number of cities that currently experience these sweltering temperatures.
But the irony is that cities are not just affected by climate change, they're also causing it.
Cities consume between 60 and 80 percent of global energy resources and account for approximately 70 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions.
As we can see here in this map, the light blue and the yellow areas correspond to those with the highest fossil fuel-based carbon dioxide emissions and also correspond to major urban centers.
Aside from cities' energy consumption, growing urban areas convert the planet's green surfaces to buildings and pavement, and these can absorb more of the sun's energy than the natural grasslands and forests that they've replaced, making urban areas hotter than their surrounding environments.
This phenomenon is called the "urban heat island effect.
" Here in Singapore, downtown neighborhoods can be as much as seven degrees Celsius, or 13 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than the rainforests that were once here.
While it's true that cities are contributing to climate change, they're also key actors in forging low carbon emission pathways.
In dense cities like New York City and Tokyo, for instance, the average resident is responsible for over two tons of carbon dioxide emissions per capita.
This is less than a single passenger car emits in a single year in the United States.
Cities around the world are stepping up to tackle climate change, with ambitious policies that often exceed the requirements of national governments.
Recent analysis shows that just 6,000 cities, combined with regions and companies, are undertaking climate initiatives that can reduce global emissions by up to two gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030. That's roughly four percent of the world's total annual emissions on top of what national governments have pledged.
And this is just the start. Imagine what could happen if 20,000 cities were to band together to curb climate change.
While this potential for cities' climate action sounds really promising, cities must work to make sure that these policies are implemented fairly and equitably.
Where you live in a city, your income, your race -- research is showing that these factors can determine your access to environmental benefits like green space and sustainable transit, and they can also determine your share of environmental burdens like air pollution and climate change.
We observe these neighborhood-level disparities particularly clearly in these side-by-side images of Los Angeles, comparing income on the left and tree cover on the right.
The darkest green neighborhood has an average annual income of over 100,000 US dollars per person.
And over 70 percent of it has tree cover.
The blue neighborhoods towards the bottom of the map only have a third of the income per person and less than five percent tree cover.
Seventy percent versus five.
This disparity has real consequences.
Green spaces are often public spaces, and they're known to be associated with social and economic well-being.
They can also reduce crime and foster social cohesion.
Trees also can help to filter harmful air pollution and provide evaporative cooling and shade and relief for some of these high temperatures.
So not only are those poorer neighborhoods at a greater disadvantage from access to green space, but they're also more vulnerable to air pollution and climate change.
We can observe particularly pronounced disparities in urban heat according to race.
Our latest research shows that 97 percent of major urban areas in the United States are exposing Black populations and people of color to a full degree Celsius higher of urban heat than their white counterparts.
Take a look at this map of my hometown of Greenville, South Carolina. Unlike the name suggests it is not green for everyone.
The hottest areas of the county shown on the map in red correspond with the highest percentages of Black and poor populations.
And we're seeing similar patterns throughout cities all across the United States.
To address these inequalities, cities are starting to strategize and develop plans that can ensure that climate benefits are provided to all of their citizens equally.
Take Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia, for example. It has one of the most extensive bike networks in all of Latin America, connecting people to jobs, education centers and recreational opportunities.
A new bike highway project can allow for around 42,000 daily bicycle trips and potentially avoid 270,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.
In Africa, where many cities lack universal access to electricity, mini-grids are providing approximately 73 million households with clean electricity.
So as we can see from these examples, tackling climate change has to start in cities.
Many cities are starting to flip the script on climate change, proving to be part of the solution and not just the problem, and bringing the kind of innovative solutions that we need for a more just and sustainable world.
Thank you.
Fourteen Greenlands could fit in Africa, but you wouldn’t guess it from most maps of the world.
The fact is, every world map humans have ever made is wrong.
Actually, it’s impossible to make a map of the world 100% right.
No, not you, globe— we know you’re accurate.
Not you, Google Earth, you’re just a digital globe.
We're talking about flat maps, which, let's face it, are way more convenient for a lot of things.
Anyway, as we were saying, it’s impossible to make a 100% accurate flat map of a spherical planet.
They just plonked places down in arbitrary locations without any consistent scale. Then in 150 AD, the Greek mathematician and astronomer Ptolemy systematically mapped the Earth on a grid and placed locations on the grid according to coordinates, so maps could be checked against others and replicated.
In spite of these advances, people kept getting lost.
Part of the problem was a— shall we say— incomplete understanding of the world’s geography.
If we draw this route on a flat map, it passes through every line of longitude at a different angle.
In 1569, Gerardus Mercator fixed this problem.
In fact, it’s still widely used today, including in online maps.
What does that mean?
The map can be land-oriented. . . or ocean-oriented.
Either way, the so-called orange peel map isn’t very easy to read.
The Dymaxion Projection by American architect Buckminster Fuller in the 1940s is even better.
It is better in the sense that there are no visibly evident distortions of the land masses. Though if you wanted to know, say, how far Brazil is from Nigeria, you won’t get any sense of that from this map.
First of all, we learned we're not family.
Everybody has all of these things to figure out and coordinate.
We're now focusing on the results that matter, not the work.
We don't care what some other company is doing.
Nobody's doing it best.
So if we start to think about context, it's really important that we think about how we teach that.
And so then we can start operating relatively independently as a whole organization because we're all moving in the same direction, trying to do the same thing.
And there's a really critically important part of making that work, and that's communication.
And everything about communication has changed.
We tend to think that communication is this waterfall from the top to the bottom.
The executives would tell somebody and the next level would tell somebody and we'd go all the way down to the shop floor and everybody would understand what's going on.
Well, it may not have worked that well then, but it certainly doesn't work that well now.
So now we have to recognize it's a different heartbeat.
What has it been before and what should it be now?
How do we make sure that the messages are clear and consistent?
Because that's how people operate.
That's how those adults who get the freedom and the responsibility to produce great results operate best is when they understand what they need to know in order to make the best decisions.
So that communication, that skill around being a great communicator is something that each of us needs to get better at.
And you don't have to look at it for a month.
But when you look back, over a month, you want to look for, "Wow, that was surprising.
I didn’t really think that would be as effective as it is.
” Or maybe it would be, like, "We keep trying to have this in-person meeting in Zoom, and it turns out that there's 14 people on the call and only two of them are talking.
Maybe it's an email.
" So we have to rethink all of the ways, not just the work we're doing, but the ways we're doing it.
So now I'm starting to hear a lot of nostalgia around the way it used to be.
There are things we aren't doing now that don't matter.
Maybe we don't need to go back for five levels of approval.
Maybe we don't need to go back and do that annual performance review.
Maybe we don't need to do a whole bunch of things that were part of the way we do business that just aren't making a difference.
You know what?
The way we used to do it not only is not the way of the future, but we're discovering so many wonderful things right now.
Let's not lose it.
We want to create a new organization, new workforce, that's excited about taking all of the things that we've learned using that muscle, going forward.
One of the most important things that we can do is realize the things that we aren't doing now.
The stuff that we've stopped doing and not go back and do it again.
What if we don't go back?
What if we go forward and rethink the way we work?
Furthermore, in order to be able to do all that, we have to recognize that we're all adults.
And here's the deal about adults. Adults have responsibilities, adults have obligations. Adults have things that they have to commit to.
And do you know that every single person that works for you, from the shop floor to the executive suite, is a grown-up?
But we have been operating as if they aren't.
We operate as if only the smart adults are the people who are at the C Suite.
And as we move through the organization, everybody sort of gets a little dumbed down and the rules get a lot stricter and we have to have more control. And the truth is, everybody's a grown-up, we can see it now.
Everybody has all of these things to figure out and coordinate.
And so now we're expecting from people adult behavior.
We're now focusing on the results that matter, not the work.
And the way we track it now is we don't walk by and see who's working.
We pay attention to what people are doing.
And I think that that's always been the best metric.
And you know what?
For the first time in my life, the concept of best practices is out the window.
And you know what?
We don't care what Google's doing because we're not Google.
We don't care what some other company is doing.
Nobody's doing it best.
So if we start to think about context, it's really important that we think about how we teach that.
And so then we can start operating relatively independently as a whole organization because we're all moving in the same direction, trying to do the same thing.
And there's a really critically important part of making that work, and that's communication.
And everything about communication has changed.
We tend to think that communication is this waterfall from the top to the bottom.
The executives would tell somebody and the next level would tell somebody and we'd go all the way down to the shop floor and everybody would understand what's going on.
Well, it may not have worked that well then, but it certainly doesn't work that well now.
So now we have to recognize it's a different heartbeat.
What has it been before and what should it be now?
How do we make sure that the messages are clear and consistent?
Because that's how people operate.
That's how those adults who get the freedom and the responsibility to produce great results operate best is when they understand what they need to know in order to make the best decisions.
So that communication, that skill around being a great communicator is something that each of us needs to get better at.
But when you look back, over a month, you want to look for, "Wow, that was surprising.
I didn’t really think that would be as effective as it is.
” Or maybe it would be, like, "We keep trying to have this in-person meeting in Zoom, and it turns out that there's 14 people on the call and only two of them are talking.

Al Gore: Hello everyone, I'm Al Gore, founder and chairman of the Climate Reality Project.
This extraordinary moment of great challenge and great loss is obviously also a moment of great awakening and a great opportunity.
The Climate Reality Project trains thousands of climate leaders around the world, in all 195 nations, to advocate for a future humanity deserves.
You're about to hear from four very different people who've gone through this week-long training and hear how they've been inspired to act.
I want to let them speak for themselves, beginning with Ximena Loría.
Ximena Loría: My name is Ximena Loría. I'm from Costa Rica, and I attended the 2016 training in Houston, Texas.
After the training, my life changed completely.
I founded an NGO called Misión 2 Grados.
My job has been focused on four main important topics: people's sensitization on climate change, supporting the B Corp movement, incidence in public policy and development of young leaders in environmental matters.
I'm proud of having more than 150 presentations on the climate crisis and solutions, reaching personally more than 7,500 people.
And I am also proud of being part of the Costa Rica delegation to COP25 in Spain last December.
AG: Nana Firman, born in Indonesia, is a climate advocate extraordinaire and calls herself a daughter of the rain forest.
Nana is the Muslim Coordinator for GreenFaith and cofounder of the Global Muslim Climate Network.
Nana Firman: My name is Nana Firman, and I am a Climate Reality Leader.
In my life journey, I realized that our behavior and consumption habits have contributed in environmental degradation and have resulted in global warming.
However, I believe that people grow spiritually through a strong relationship with the earth.
Being born in the rain forest region of Sumatra, I believe in the power of our forests as the natural solution to our climate crisis by giving indigenous peoples and traditional communities more rights to protect and manage the forests where they live.
Now, more than ever, it is time for us to put climate justice at the forefront and center of our struggles.
AG: In the Kaduna region of Northern Nigeria, they call Gloria Kasang Bulus the queen of the climate crisis.
Gloria has also founded a Kaduna-based NGO that is focused on education, empowerment and climate.
Gloria Kasang Bulus: My name is Gloria Kasang Bulus.
I came across the Climate Reality training and I applied for it in 2017, and that helped me to be able to build my capacity afterwards.
And then it [sprung] up my passion in climate action.
I'm really very proud of some of my achievements.
And one of my achievements is reaching out to children.
Another achievement I'm proud of is bringing the media together to talk about climate change, to have quarterly discussions of climate change.
Some works that I have done around climate change, they really, really make me proud of being a Climate Reality Leader and a climate activist.
AG: Tim Guinee is a firefighter in New York and is also the chairperson of the Climate Reality Project's Hudson Valley, Catskills chapter.
He and his chapter have secured commitments from over 100 businesses, schools and cities to adopt 100 percent renewable energy.
Tim Guinee: My name's Tim Guinee.
And they went up the stairs, and none of them ever came back.
But what I do know is they stepped forward into their destiny.
I think the climate crisis has some things in common with that moment.
None of us would have asked for the climate crisis to have been put on our doorstep, but it is; it's here.
This is our historical reality.
And we have a choice to make.
Our destiny is to decide whether we're going to respond to the climate crisis or whether we're going to pretend that it's not happening, deny it.
I think this is our moment of destiny, and I hope you'll decide to take part, to fight against the climate crisis, because we need you.
AG: Four people, four stories of success and change.
Immediately after this Countdown event, "24 Hours of Reality" will begin around the world at 4pm Eastern Standard Time in the US, featuring thousands of presentations from climate leaders just like the ones you've just seen.
Use your voice, find your power, find your passion.
Don't let this extraordinary moment pass.
Together, we can ensure that this will mark the beginning of a healthy, just and sustainable future for all.Al Gore: Hello everyone, I'm Al Gore, founder and chairman of the Climate Reality Project.

After a three-hour concert by her favorite Norwegian metal band, Anja finds it difficult to hear her friend rave about the show. It sounds like he's speaking from across the room, and it’s tough to make out his muted voice over the ringing in her ears.
By the next morning, the effect has mostly worn off, but Anja still has questions.
What caused the symptoms?
Is her hearing going to fully recover?
And can she still go to concerts without damaging her ears?
To answer these questions, we first need to understand what sound is and how we hear it.
Like a pebble creating ripples in water, sound is created when displaced molecules vibrate through space.
While sound vibrations can travel through solids and liquids, our ears have evolved to process vibrations in the air.
These waves of air pressure enter our ear canals and bounce off the eardrum.
A trio of bones called the ossicular chain then carries those vibrations into the cochlea, transforming waves of air pressure into waves of cochlear fluid.
Here, our perception of sound begins to take form.
The waves of fluid move the basilar membrane, a tissue lined with tens of thousands of hair cells.
The specific vibration of these hair cells and the stereocilia on top of each one determine the auditory signal our brain perceives.
Unfortunately, these essential cells are also quite vulnerable.
There are two properties of sound that can damage these cells.
The first is volume.
The louder a sound is, the greater the pressure of its vibrations.
While the ear’s upper limits vary from person to person, close range exposure to sound exceeding 120 decibels can instantly bend or blow out hair cells, resulting in permanent hearing damage.
The pressure of more powerful sounds can even dislocate the ossicular chain or burst an eardrum.
The other side of this equation is the sound’s duration.
While dangerously loud sounds can injure ears almost instantly, hair cells can also be damaged by exposure to lower sound pressure for long periods.
For example, hearing a hand dryer is safe for the 20 seconds you’re using it. But if you listened for 8 consecutive hours, this relatively low-pressure sound would overwork the stereocilia and swell the hair cell’s supporting tissue.
Swollen hair cells are unable to vibrate with the appropriate speed and accuracy, making hearing muffled.
This kind of hearing loss is known as a temporary threshold shift, and many people will experience it at least once in their lifetime.
In Anja’s case, the loud sounds of the concert only took three hours to cause this condition.
Fortunately, it's a temporary ailment that usually resolves as swelling decreases over time.
In most cases, simply avoiding hazardous sounds gives hair cells all they need to recover.
One temporary threshold shift isn’t likely to cause permanent hearing loss.
But frequent exposure to dangerous sound levels can lead to a wide range of hearing disorders, such as the constant buzz of tinnitus or difficulty understanding speech in loud environments.
Overworked hair cells can also generate dangerous molecules called reactive oxygen species.
These molecules have unpaired electrons, driving them to steal electrons from nearby cells and cause permanent damage to the inner ear.
There are numerous strategies you can adopt for preventing hearing loss.
Current research around earbud headphone use suggests keeping your volume at 80% or less if you’ll be listening for more than 90 minutes throughout the day.
Noise-isolating headphones can also help you listen at lower volumes.
Getting a baseline understanding of your hearing is essential to protecting your auditory system.
Just like our eyes and teeth, our ears also need annual check-ups.
Not all communities have access to audiologists, but organizations around the world are developing portable hearing tests and easy-to-use apps to bring these vital resources to remote regions.
Finally, wear earplugs when you’re knowingly exposing yourself to loud sounds for extended periods.
An earplug’s effectiveness depends on how well you’ve inserted it, so be careful to read the instructions.
But when worn correctly, they can ensure you'll be able to hear your favorite band for many nights to come.
Don Cheadle: Home.
It's where we celebrate our triumphs, make our memories and confront our challenges.
And these days there are plenty of those.
An historic pandemic, wildfires, floods and hurricanes all threaten our basic safety.
These challenges hit even harder in communities that have been cut out of equal opportunities.
In the US, unfair and racist housing policies, called redlining, have for decades forced Black, brown, Indigenous and poor white families into areas rife with toxic chemicals that make people sick.
They are surrounded by concrete that traps heat.
Imagine all we can do when we realize the solutions are too.
At the Solutions Project, we've seen that some of the people most impacted by COVID-19, least likely to have a steady place to call home and most affected by the damage to our climate are already working on effective and scalable solutions.
Take Buffalo and Miami, where affordable housing has become a community solution to the climate crisis.
Rahwa Ghirmatzion: Buffalo, New York, is the third poorest city in the United States and sixth most segregated, but our people power is strong.
Over the last 15 years, my organization, PUSH Buffalo, has been working with residents to build green affordable housing, deploy renewable energy and to grow the resilience and power in our communities.
When we saw heating bills soar over the last decade, we organized to pass state policy, help small businesses and to put our people to work weatherizing homes.
We responded with eco-landscaping and green infrastructure.
When record rainfalls flooded our neighborhoods, we replaced the concrete that overwhelmed and made heat waves unbearable.
Let us visit School 77, an 80,000-square-foot public school building that was closed and abandoned for nearly a decade.
But PUSH Buffalo and the community transformed it into solar-powered, affordable senior apartments and a community center.
This is what the community wanted.
When private developers were eyeing that school building for high-end loft apartments, 800 residents mobilized and came up with the plan.
We became New York State's first community solar project and during the coronavirus pandemic, a volunteer-run Mutual Aid Hub.
Zelalem Adefris: At Catalyst Miami and the Miami Climate Alliance, we work with dozens of other organizations to enact policies that provide safe housing and protect the climate.
Here in Miami, we've seen a 400-percent increase in tidal flooding between 2006 and 2016 and have seen 49 additional 90-degree days per year since 1970. We fought for the Miami Forever Bond to fund 400 million dollars for affordable housing and climate solutions.
Yet every day, we continue to see luxury high-rise condos being built in our neighborhoods, adding more concrete and heat on the ground.
Some of our members are taking matters into their own hands, literally.
Conscious Contractors is a Grassroots Collective that formed during Hurricane Irma to protect, rebuild and beautify our communities, all while increasing energy efficiency.
They don't think that anyone should have to choose between paying a high AC bill and living in a hot and moldy house that will worsen respiratory illnesses such as asthma or coronavirus.
They fix problems at the source.
Advocates across the country are holding their governments accountable to climate solutions that keep their communities in place.
We need to push for more affordable housing, green infrastructure and flood protections because these are the solutions that solve many problems at once.
DC: Climate change is the epic challenge of our lives, but we're confident we can solve it.
Community leaders like Rahwa and Zelalem are already doing it.
We can create the future we want, but getting there is going to take everyone contributing around the world, wherever we call home.
Everyone's heard of the tired old adage of paying yourself first.
But that saying lacks a lot of useful details.
How do you actually pay yourself first?
So today, I'll lead you through some changes you can make to improve your saving strategy.
[Your Money and Your Mind with Wendy De La Rosa] First and foremost, you should focus on only one goal at a time.
Typically, we think about having multiple savings goals for multiple things.
We have an emergency savings fund, a vacation fund, a wedding fund, a car fund . . . But one great study compared people's savings progress when they had one savings goal compared to five savings goals.
And it turns out that when participants had just one savings goal, they saved more than when they had five.
The research showed that if you made progress in just one of your savings accounts, you'd think you've made progress across all of them.
Like multitasking at work, splitting your attention across multiple savings goals just isn't efficient.
Now, that's not to say that this will be your only savings goal; you'll have many more throughout your life.
But I want you to think about the one thing that you want to focus on over the next six months to a year.
Start with your emergency savings fund, even if it’s 500 dollars or 600 dollars, the average cost of a car repair, and then go from there.
Now, some people advise saving 10, 15 or 20 percent of your income, but that's not important.
You know your financial situation.
You know how much you can manage to save.
The real trick is to find a provider that lets you set up an automatic savings plan and not to have to think about it ever again.
The "set it and forget it" approach is shown to help you save more.
Researchers believe that passive systems like this are successful, because they work with our tendency towards inertia.
You don't have to manually initiate each subsequent transfer, and you won't be tempted to hold back a bit every time you make a savings transfer.
I want you to take the time right now to find a provider.
Go to your app store, download the app and set up your automatic savings plan.
If you make these two small changes -- focus on just one savings goal at a time and automate your savings -- you should find success, even if you don't think you're saving that much money.
And it's easier than it may seem.
So there you have it.
We have demystified the old adage of paying yourself first.
Concrete is the second most used substance on earth after water, and for this reason, it has a significant environmental impact.
If it were a country, it would rank third for emissions after China and USA.
But in fact, concrete is an intrinsically low-impact material with much lower emissions of CO2 and energy per ton than other materials like iron and steel, even things like bricks.
But because of the enormous volumes we use overall, it contributes to about eight percent of man-made CO2 emissions.
Concrete is an essential material.
We need it to house people, to build roads, bridges and dams.
So we can't do without it, but we can significantly reduce its carbon footprint.
Concrete is held together by cement.
And cement we use today, called Portland cement, is made by heating together a combination of limestone and clay at a temperature of 1,450 degrees Celsius.
But in fact, most of the CO2 emissions come not from the heating, but from the breakdown of limestone, which is calcium carbonate, into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, or CO2. Now we can't do without this component altogether, because nothing else is so efficient at holding stuff together.
But we can replace a large proportion of it with other materials with lighter carbon footprints.
Many colleagues are looking for solutions.
And here in Switzerland, we have found that clays produce very reactive materials when they're calcined, that's to say heated to around 800 degrees Celsius, significantly lower than the 1,450 needed to produce cement.
But more importantly, there's no CO2 emissions from the decomposition of limestone.
We then take this calcined clay, and we add a bit of limestone -- but this time not heated, so no CO2 emissions -- and some cement, and this combination of limestone, calcined clay and cement, we call LC3. Now this LC3 here has the same properties as Portland cement.
It can be produced with the same equipment and processes and used in the same way, but has up to 40 percent lower CO2 emissions.
And this was demonstrated in this house we built near Jhansi in India, where we could save more than 15 tons of CO2, which was 30 to 40 percent compared to existing materials.
So why isn't everybody already using LC3? Well, cement is a local material.
The reason Portland cement is so pervasive is that it's produced from the most abundant materials on Earth and can be produced in India, in the United States, in Ethiopia, almost anywhere.
And we have to work with people locally to find the best combination of materials to make LC3. We have already done full-scale trials in India and Cuba.
In Colombia, a product based on this technology was commercialized a few months ago, and in the Ivory Coast, the full-scale plant is being commissioned to calcine clays.
And many of the world's largest cement companies are looking to introduce this in some of their plants soon.
On the dusty roads of a small village, a travelling salesman was having difficulty selling his wares.
He’d recently traversed the region just a few weeks ago, and most of the villagers had already seen his supply.
So he wandered the outskirts of the town in the hopes of finding some new customers.
Unfortunately, the road was largely deserted, and the salesman was about to turn back, when he heard a high-pitched yelp coming from the edge of the forest.
Following the screams to their source, he discovered a trapped tanuki.
While these racoon-like creatures were known for their wily ways, this one appeared terrified and powerless.
The salesman freed the struggling creature, but before he could tend to its wounds, it bolted into the undergrowth.
The next day, he set off on his usual route.
As he trudged along, he spotted a discarded tea kettle.
It was rusty and old— but perhaps he could sell it to the local monks.
The salesman polished it until it sparkled and shone. He carried the kettle to Morin-ji Temple and presented it to the solemn monks.
His timing was perfect— they were in need of a large kettle for an important service, and purchased his pot for a handsome price.
To open the ceremony, they began to pour cups of tea for each monk— but the kettle cooled too quickly.
It had to be reheated often throughout the long service, and when it was hot, it seemed to squirm in the pourer’s hand.
By the end of the ceremony, the monks felt cheated by their purchase, and called for the salesman to return and explain himself.
The following morning, the salesman examined the pot, but he couldn’t find anything unusual about it. Hoping a cup of tea would help them think, they set the kettle on the fire.
Within moments, the metal began to sweat.
Suddenly, it sprouted a scrubby tail, furry paws and pointed nose.
With a yelp, the salesman recognized the tanuki he’d freed.
The salesman was shocked.
He’d heard tales of shape-shifting tanuki who transformed by pulling on their testicles. But they were usually troublesome tricksters, who played embarrassing pranks on travellers, or made it rain money that later dissolved into leaves.
Some people even placed tanuki statues outside their homes and businesses to trick potential pranksters into taking their antics elsewhere.
However, this tanuki only smiled sweetly.
Why had he chosen this unsuspecting form?
The tanuki explained that he wanted to repay the salesman’s kindness.
However, he’d grown too hot as a tea kettle, and didn’t like being burned, scrubbed, or polished.
The monk and salesman laughed, both impressed by this honourable trickster.
From that day on, the tanuki became an esteemed guest of the temple.
He could frequently be found telling tales and performing tricks that amused even the most serious monks.
Villagers came from far away to see the temple tanuki, and the salesman visited often to share tea made from an entirely normal kettle.On the dusty roads of a small village, a travelling salesman was having difficulty selling his wares.

For too long, those of us who live in cities big and small have accepted the unacceptable.
We accept that in cities our sense of time is warped, because we have to waste so much of it just adapting to the absurd organization and long distances of most of today's cities.
Why is it we who have to adapt and to degrade our potential quality of life?
Why is it not the city that responds to our needs?
I call it "the 15-minute city.
Have you ever stopped to ask yourself: Why does a noisy and polluted street need to be a noisy and polluted street?
Just because it is?
Our acceptance of the dysfunctions and indignities of modern cities has reached a peak.
First, we need to start asking questions that we have forgotten.
For instance, we need to look hard at how we use our square meters.
What is that space for?
Who's using it and how?
We need to understand what resources we have and how they are used.
Then we need to ask what services are available in the vicinity -- not only in the city center, in every vicinity.
Health providers, shops, artisans, markets, sports, cultural life, schools, parks.
Are there green areas?
Are there water fountains placed to cool off during the frequent heat waves?
We also have to ask ourselves: How do we work?
Why is the place I live here, and work is far away?
We need to rethink cities around the four guiding principles that are the key building blocks of the 15-minute city.
First, ecology: for a green and sustainable city.
Second, proximity: to live with reduced distance to other activities.
Third, solidarity: to create links between people.
Finally, participation should actively involve citizens in the transformation of their neighborhood.
Don't get me wrong -- I'm not angling for cities to become rural hamlets.
Urban life is vibrant and creative.
Cities are places of economic dynamism and innovation.
But we need to make urban life more pleasant, agile, healthy and flexible.
To do so, we need to make sure everyone -- and I mean everyone, those living downtown and those living at the fringes -- has access to all key services within proximity.
How do we get this done?
The first city to adopt the 15-minute city idea is Paris, France.
That's actually a golden rule of the 15-minute city: every square meter that’s already built should be used for different things.
The 15-minute city is an attempt to reconcile the city with the humans that live in it.
The 15-minute city should have three key features.
First, the rhythm of the city should follow humans, not cars.
Second, each square meter should serve many different purposes.
Finally, neighborhoods should be designed so that we can live, work and thrive in them without having to constantly commute elsewhere.
It's funny if you think of it: the way many modern cities are designed is often determined by the imperative to save time, and yet so much time is lost to commuting, sitting in traffic jams, driving to a mall, in a bubble of illusory acceleration.
The 15-minute city idea answers the question of saving time by turning it on its head, by suggesting a different pace of life.
A 15-minute pace.
Thank you.
Princess Savitri of the Madra Kingdom was as benevolent, brilliant, and bright as the Sun God she was named for.
Her grace was known throughout the land, and many powerful princes and wealthy merchants flocked to her family’s palace to seek her hand in marriage.
But upon witnessing her blinding splendor in person, the men lost their nerve.
Unimpressed with these suitors, the princess determined to find a husband herself.
Mounting her golden chariot, she travelled through rolling deserts, glittering cities and snow-capped mountains— rejecting many men along the way.
Eventually, Savitri ventured deep into the jungle, where she met a young man chopping wood.
His name was Satyavan, and like her, he loved the tranquil forest— but the princess saw he was not at peace.
After talking for hours, Satyavan told her of his plight.
His parents had once been wealthy rulers, until his father was blinded and overthrown in a violent coup.
Now Satyavan worked tirelessly to support their meager new life.
His determination and devotion moved the princess.
As they gazed into each other’s eyes, she knew she’d finally found an equal.
Savitri rushed home to tell her father the good news, only to find him conversing with Narada a traveling sage and wisest messenger of the Gods.
At first her father was thrilled to learn of Satyavan, but Narada revealed a tragic prophecy: her betrothed had only a year to live.
Savitri’s blood ran cold.
She’d waited so long to find her partner— was she already doomed to lose him?
The princess would not accept these terms. She swore before Narada, her family, and Savitr himself that she would never marry another.
This was Yamraj, the God of Death, come to escort Satyavan’s soul to the afterlife.
But Savitri was not giving up yet.
She followed the god for hours in the beating sun.
Yamraj thundered at the princess to leave him in peace.
But even as her feet bled and throat burned, Savitri would not turn back.
Eventually, Yamraj paused.
He would grant her one wish as reward for her persistence, but she couldn’t ask for her husband’s life.
Without hesitating, Savitri asked the God to restore her father in-law’s sight.
The wish was granted, and Yamraj rode on.
This time, she asked for Satyavan’s kingdom to be restored.
Again the wish was granted, and Yamraj began his descent into his subterranean kingdom.
But when he glanced back, he was astounded to see the bedraggled princess stumbling along. He’d never seen such devotion to the dead, and he honored her dedication with one final wish.
Savitri wished to be the mother of many children.
The God agreed, and waved to dismiss her.
But the princess only repeated the vow she’d made one year earlier: her fate was forever entwined with Satyavan.
How could she bear many children, if Yamraj would not return her husband?
A mirror that shatters without warning.
Everyone at 124 Bluestone Road knows their house is haunted— but there’s no mystery about the spirit tormenting them.
So begins "Beloved," Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the suffering wrought by slavery and the wounds that persist in its wake.
When the novel opens, Sethe has been living free for over a decade.
When a visitor from Sethe’s old life returns and threatens the ghost away, it seems like the start of a new beginning for her family.
Morrison writes about black identities in a variety of contexts, but her characters are united by their desire to find love and be loved— even when it’s painful.
In "Sula," one character realizes that it’s not her marriage, but rather, one of her friendships that embodies the great love of her life.
Perhaps Morrison’s most famous exploration of the difficulty of love takes place in "Beloved.
” Their coping mechanisms are different; Sethe remains mired in her past, while Paul D. dissociates himself completely.
As she delves into the psyche of townspeople, enslavers, and previously enslaved people, she exposes conflicting viewpoints on reality.
For buildings, roads, and bridges, we pour what's called ready-mix concrete into a mold on the job site and wait for it to cure over time.
Now, for over 50 years, scientists believed that if they cured concrete with CO2 instead of water, it would be more durable, but they were hamstrung by Portland cement's chemistry.
You see, it likes to react with both water and CO2, and those conflicting chemistries just don't make for very good concrete.
So we came up with a new cement chemistry.
We use the same equipment and raw materials, but we use less limestone, and we fire the kiln at a lower temperature, resulting in up to a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions.
Our cement doesn't react with water.
We cure our concrete with CO2, and we get that CO2 by capturing waste gas from industrial facilities like ammonia plants or ethanol plants that otherwise would've been released into the atmosphere.
During curing, the chemical reaction with our cement breaks apart the CO2, capturing the carbon to make limestone, and that limestone's used to bind the concrete together.
Now, if a bridge made out of our concrete were ever demolished, there's no fear of the CO2 being emitted because it doesn't exist any longer.
When you combine the emissions reduction during cement production with the CO2 consumption during concrete curing, we reduce cement's carbon footprint by up to 70 percent.
And because we don't consume water, we also save trillions of liters of water.
Now, convincing a 2,000-year-old industry that hasn't evolved much over the last 200 years, is not easy; but there are lots of new and existing industry players that are attacking that challenge. Our strategy is to ease adoption by seeking solutions that go beyond just sustainability.
We use the same processes, raw material, and equipment that's used to make traditional concrete, but our new cement makes concrete cured with CO2 that is stronger, more durable, lighter in color, and it cures in 24 hours instead of 28 days.
Our new technology for ready-mix is in testing and infrastructure applications, and we've pushed our research even further to develop a concrete that may become a carbon sink.
That means that we will consume more CO2 than is emitted during cement production.
Since we can't use CO2 gas at a construction site, we knew we had to deliver it to our concrete in either a solid or liquid form.
So we've been partnering with companies that are taking waste CO2 and transforming it into a useful family of chemicals like oxalic acid or citric acid, the same one you use in orange juice.
When that acid reacts with our cement, we can pack in as much as four times more carbon into the concrete, making it carbon negative.
That means that for a one-kilometer road section, we would consume more CO2 than almost a 100,000 trees do during one year.
So thanks to chemistry and waste CO2, we're trying to convert the concrete industry, the second-most-used material on the planet, into a carbon sink for the planet.
Thank you.
In 1942, a mother-daughter duo Katherine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers developed a questionnaire that classified people’s personalities into 16 types.
Called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or MBTI, it would go on to become one of the world’s most widely-used personality tests.
Today, personality testing is a multi-billion dollar industry used by individuals, schools, and companies.
But none of these tests, including the MBTI, the Big Five, the DiSC assessment, the Process Communication Model, and the Enneagram, actually reveal truths about personality.
In fact, it’s up for debate whether personality is a stable, measurable feature of an individual at all.
Part of the problem is the way the tests are constructed.
Each is based on a different set of metrics to define personality: the Myers-Briggs, for instance, focuses on features like introversion and extroversion to classify people into personality "types," while the Big Five scores participants on five different traits.
Most are self-reported, meaning the results are based on questions participants answer about themselves.
So it’s easy to lie, but even with the best intentions, objective self-evaluation is tricky.
Take this question from the Big Five: How would you rate the accuracy of the statement "I am always prepared"?
There’s a clear favorable answer here, which makes it difficult to be objective.
People subconsciously aim to please: when asked to agree or disagree, we show a bias toward answering however we believe the person or institution asking the question wants us to answer. Here’s another question— what do you value more, justice or fairness?
What about harmony or forgiveness?
You may well value both sides of each pair, but the MBTI would force you to choose one.
And while it’s tempting to assume the results of that forced choice must somehow reveal a true preference, they don’t: When faced with the same forced choice question multiple times, the same person will sometimes change their answer.
Given these design flaws, it’s no surprise that test results can be inconsistent.
One study found that nearly half of people who take the Myers-Briggs a second time only five weeks after the first get assigned a different type.
And other studies on the Myers-Briggs have found that people with very similar scores end up being placed in different categories, suggesting that the strict divisions between personality types don’t reflect real-life nuances.
Complicating matters further, the definitions of personality traits are constantly shifting.
The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who popularized the terms introvert and extrovert, defined an introvert as someone who sticks to their principles regardless of situation, and an extrovert as someone who molds their self according to circumstance.
Introversion later came to mean shyness, while an extrovert was someone outgoing.
Today, an introvert is someone who finds alone time restorative, an extrovert draws energy from social interaction, and an ambivert falls somewhere between these two extremes.
The notion of an innate, unchanging personality forms the basis of all these tests.
But research increasingly suggests that personality shifts during key periods— like our school years, or when we start working.
Though certain features of a person’s behavior may remain relatively stable over time, others are malleable, moulded by our upbringing, life experiences, and age.
All of this matters more or less depending on how a personality test is used.
Though anyone using them should take the results with a grain of salt, there isn’t much harm in individual use— and users may even learn some new terms and concepts in the process.
But the use of personality tests extends far beyond self discovery.
Schools use them to advise students what to study and what jobs to pursue.
Companies use them decide who to hire and for what positions.
Yet the results don’t predict how a person will perform in a specific role.
So by using personality tests this way, institutions can deprive people of opportunities they’d excel at, or discourage them from considering certain paths.
Take a ride in Emily Dickinson's chariot.

But beware. . . there's no turning back.

So here's a thought.
The fossil fuel industry knows how to stop causing global warming, but they're waiting for somebody else to pay, and no one is calling them out on it.
I was one of the authors of the 2018 IPCC report on 1.5 degrees Celsius.
And after the report was published, I gave a lot of talks, including one to a meeting of young engineers of one of the world's major oil and gas companies.
And at the end of the talk, I got the inevitable question, "Do you personally believe there's any chance of us limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees?
" "Would the same rules apply to everybody?
" somebody asked, meaning, of course, their competition.
I said, "OK, yeah, maybe they would.
" Now, the management just looked at their shoes; they didn't want to answer the question. But the young engineers just shrugged and said, "Yes, of course we would, like it's even a question.
" So I want to talk to you about what those young engineers know how to do: decarbonize fossil fuels. Not decarbonize the economy, or even decarbonize their own company, but decarbonize the fuels themselves, and this matters because it turns out to be essential to stopping global warming.
At a global level, climate change turns out to be surprisingly simple: To stop global warming we need to stop dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
And since about 85 percent of the carbon dioxide we currently emit comes from fossil fuels and industry, we need to stop fossil fuels from causing further global warming.
So how do we do that?
Well, it turns out there's really only two options.
The first option is, in effect, to ban fossil fuels. That's what "absolute zero" means.
No one allowed to extract, sell, or use fossil fuels anywhere in the world on pain of a massive fine.
If that sounds unlikely, it's because it is.
And even if a global ban were possible, do you or I in wealthy countries in 2020 have any right to tell the citizens of poor and emerging economies in the 2060s not to touch their fossil fuels?
Some people argue that if we work hard enough we can drive down the cost of renewable energy so far that we won't need to ban fossil fuels, the people will stop using them of their own accord.
This kind of thinking is dangerously optimistic.
For one thing, renewable energy costs might not go down as fast as they hope.
I mean, remember, nuclear energy was meant to be too cheap to meter in the 1970s, but even more importantly, we've no idea how low fossil fuel prices might fall in response to that competition.
There are so many uses of fossil carbon, from aviation fuel to cement production, it's not enough for carbon-free alternatives to outcompete the big ones, to stop fossil fuels from causing further global warming, carbon-free alternatives would need to outcompete them all.
So the only real alternative to stop fossil fuels causing global warming is to decarbonize them.
I know that sounds odd, decarbonize fossil fuels.
What it means is, one ton of carbon dioxide has to be safely and permanently disposed of for every ton generated by the continued use of fossil fuels.
Now, consumers can't do this, so the responsibility has to lie with the companies that are producing and selling the fossil fuels themselves.
Their engineers know how to do it. In fact, they've known for decades.
To stop further global warming, permanent storage has to mean tens of thousands of years at least, which is why trying to mop up our fossil carbon emissions by planting trees can help, but it can only be a temporary stopgap.
For some applications like aviation fuel, for example, we can't capture the carbon dioxide at source, so we have to recapture it, take it back out of the atmosphere.
That can be done; there's companies already doing it, but it's more expensive.
But the good news is, we don't need to dispose of 100 percent of the carbon dioxide we generate from burning fossil fuels right away.
So don't get me wrong, decarbonizing fossil fuels is not going to be easy.
It's going to mean building a carbon dioxide disposal industry comparable in size to today's oil and gas industry.
The only entities in the world that have the engineering capability and the deep pockets to do this are the companies that produce the fossil fuels themselves.
We can all help by slowing down our use of fossil carbon to buy them time to decarbonize it, but they still have to get on with it.
But, unlike a tax, that money is clearly being spent on solving the problem, and of course, consumers will respond, perhaps by switching to electric cars, for example, but they won't need to be told to do so.
And if we do decarbonize fossil fuels, as well as getting things like deforestation under control, we will stop global warming. And if we don't, we won't. It's as simple as that. But it's going to take a movement to make this happen.
Well, it depends on who you are.
You own this problem. You need to fix it.
It's time to call on the fossil fuel industry to help solve the problem their product has created.
I was one of the authors of the 2018 IPCC report on 1.5 degrees Celsius.
" somebody asked, meaning, of course, their competition.
" Now, the management just looked at their shoes; they didn't want to answer the question. But the young engineers just shrugged and said, "Yes, of course we would, like it's even a question.
" So I want to talk to you about what those young engineers know how to do: decarbonize fossil fuels. Not decarbonize the economy, or even decarbonize their own company, but decarbonize the fuels themselves, and this matters because it turns out to be essential to stopping global warming.
At a global level, climate change turns out to be surprisingly simple: To stop global warming we need to stop dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
And since about 85 percent of the carbon dioxide we currently emit comes from fossil fuels and industry, we need to stop fossil fuels from causing further global warming.
So how do we do that?
The first option is, in effect, to ban fossil fuels. That's what "absolute zero" means.

I mean, remember, nuclear energy was meant to be too cheap to meter in the 1970s, but even more importantly, we've no idea how low fossil fuel prices might fall in response to that competition.
And this points to the single most important reason why recapturing and safe disposal of carbon dioxide is not already standard practice: cost. It's infinitely cheaper just to dump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it is to capture it and dispose of it safely back underground.
So don't get me wrong, decarbonizing fossil fuels is not going to be easy.
The only entities in the world that have the engineering capability and the deep pockets to do this are the companies that produce the fossil fuels themselves.
So how can you help?
You own this problem. You need to fix it.
How is it helping to increase the fraction of carbon dioxide we generate from fossil fuels that is safely and permanently disposed of?
Thank you.
" So the end is this absurd slow-motion game of chase with the lights on and the dome just spinning around and around.It must have looked completely ridiculous.When I tell people about using photographic plates to study the universe, it does sound ridiculous.
It's a little absurd to take what seems like a primitive tool for studying the universe and say, well, we're going to dunk this in lemon juice, lick it, stick it in the telescope, shiver next to it for a few hours and solve the mysteries of the cosmos.
In reality, though, that's exactly what we did.
I showed you this picture before of an astronomer perched at the top of a telescope.
What I didn't tell you is who this astronomer is.
This is Edwin Hubble, and Hubble used photographic plates to completely change our entire understanding of how big the universe is and how it works.
This is a plate that Hubble took back in 1923 of an object known at the time as the Andromeda Nebula.
You can see in the upper right of that image that Hubble has labeled a star with this bright red word, "Var!
" He's even put an exclamation point next to it.
"Var" here stands for "variable.
" Hubble had found a variable star in the Andromeda Nebula.
Its brightness changed, getting brighter and dimmer as a function of time.
Hubble knew that if he studied how that star changed with time, he could measure the distance to the Andromeda Nebula, and when he did, the results were astonishing.
He discovered that this was not, in fact, a nebula.
This was the Andromeda Galaxy, an entire separate galaxy two and a half million light years beyond our own Milky Way.
This was the first evidence of other galaxies existing in the universe beyond our own, and it totally changed our understanding of how big the universe was and what it contained.
So now we can look at what telescopes can do today.
This is a modern-day picture of the Andromeda Galaxy, and it looks just like the telescope photos that we all love to enjoy and look at: it's colorful and detailed and beautiful.
We now store data like this digitally, and we take it using telescopes like these.
So this is me standing underneath a telescope with a mirror that's 26 feet across.
Bigger telescope mirrors let us take sharper and clearer images, and they also make it easier for us to gather light from faint and faraway objects.
So a bigger telescope literally gives us a farther reach into the universe, looking at things that we couldn't have seen before.
We're also no longer strapped to the telescope when we do our observations.
This is me during my very first observing trip at a telescope in Arizona.
I'm opening the dome of the telescope, but I'm not on top of the telescope to do it.
"Afar" can get pretty extreme.
" It's true that when you hear the description of what a supernova is it sounds really epic.
This was still unbelievably exciting.
We photograph the galaxy multiple times, and we look for something that's changed.
We don't want to count on happening to look up at the right time or pointing our telescope at the right galaxy.
What we ideally want is a telescope that can systematically and computationally do what Oscar did with his mind.
Oscar was able to discover this supernova because he had that galaxy memorized.
With digital data, we can effectively memorize every piece of the sky that we look at, compare old and new observations and look for anything that's changed.
This is the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile.
Now, when I visited it back in March, it was still under construction.
But this telescope will begin observations next year, and when it does, it will carry out a simple but spectacular observing program.
This telescope will photograph the entire southern sky every few days over and over, following a preset pattern for 10 years.
Computers and algorithms affiliated with the observatory will then compare every pair of images taken of the same patch of sky, looking for anything that's gotten brighter or dimmer, like a variable star, or looking for anything that's appeared, like a supernova.
Right now, we discover about a thousand supernovae every year.
The Rubin Observatory will be capable of discovering a thousand supernovae every night.
It's going to dramatically change the face of astronomy and of how we study things that change in the sky, and it will do all of this largely without much human intervention at all.
It will follow that preset pattern and computationally find anything that's changed or appeared.
This might sound a little sad at first, this idea that we're removing people from stargazing.
But in reality, our role as astronomers isn't disappearing, it's just moving.
We've already seen how we do our jobs change.
We've gone from perching atop telescopes to sitting next to them to not even needing to go to them or send them commands at all.
Where astronomers still shine is in asking questions and working with the data.
Gathering data is only the first step.
Analyzing it is where we can really apply what we know about the universe.
Human curiosity is what makes us ask questions like: How big is the universe?
How did it begin?
How's it going to end?
And are we alone?
So this is the power that humans are still able to bring to astronomy.
So compare the capabilities of a telescope like this with the observations that we were able to take like this.
We discovered amazing things with glass plates, but discovery looks different today.
The way we do astronomy looks different today.
What hasn't changed is that seed of human curiosity.
If we can harness the power of tomorrow's technology and combine it with this drive that we all have to look up and to ask questions about what we see there, we'll be ready to learn some incredible new things about the universe.
Thank you.

They're these brilliant, explosive deaths of enormous, massive stars, and they shoot energy out into the universe, and they spew material out into space, and they sound, like, noticeable.
We would be able to see that supernova at night as bright as the Moon.
It would be on headlines all over the world.
It would for sure get a hashtag.
It would be impossible to miss that a supernova had happened so nearby.
But the supernova that Oscar observed didn't happen a few hundred light years away.
This supernova happened 170,000 light years away, which is why instead of an epic explosion, it appears as a little dot.
This was still unbelievably exciting.
It was still visible with the naked eye, and the most spectacular supernova that we've seen since the invention of the telescope.
But it gives you a better sense of what most supernovae look like.
We still discover and study supernovae all the time today, but we do it in distant galaxies using powerful telescopes.
We photograph the galaxy multiple times, and we look for something that's changed.
We look for that little pinprick of light appearing that tells us that a star has died.
We can learn a great deal about the universe and about stars from supernovae, but we don't want to leave studying them up to chance.
We don't want to count on happening to look up at the right time or pointing our telescope at the right galaxy.

It was December 2015, a month since the end of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, and I was driving along the Grafton Road on the outskirts of our capital city, Freetown.
I'd driven along that road so many times over the past 18 months, but honestly, I'd been so preoccupied, I didn't notice my surroundings.
But that afternoon, I wasn't distracted, and I took it all in.
I was shocked.
So much of the once-lush green forest cover had simply disappeared.
I felt physically sick as I parked my car and looked at the barren hills around me.
I wasn't just witnessing and mourning the loss of beauty, crushing though that was. I was witnessing and mourning the very real impact of climate change, which is felt in ways both large and small in my city, my country and on my continent.
Sierra Leone now regularly experiences extreme weather patterns, particularly abnormally heavy rainfall or delayed rains, both of which can lead to crop failures and in turn fuel the migration of people from rural areas to cities.
In Freetown, a city of 1.2 million people, the pressure for housing and the absence of development control has led to the establishment of over 70 informal settlements in the past 20 years.
This, combined with the sale of forested land to house builders, has resulted in the deforestation which came into such sharp focus for me that afternoon.
Less than two years later, in August 2017, a massive landslide near that area led to the loss of about 1,000 lives in less than five minutes.
This is not an abstract crisis.
The loss of our forests is not just about the loss of some shade.
It's about the loss of our ability to live.
Wanting to do something about this was one of the factors that led to my decision to run for mayor of Freetown, a position I've held since 2018. And one of my favorite initiatives is to make Freetown a tree town once again.
Our goal: to increase vegetation cover by 50 percent in Freetown by the end of my term in 2022. That means we will plant a million trees within the next two years.
And we start by planting the first 500,000 seedlings this rainy season.
For this to work, we need to involve everyone.
We need to make our city collectively proud of what we can do together to protect ourselves and our homes.
For nearly a year now, 15 different species of trees have been nursed on 11 sites across the city.
And now each tree will be planted in a home, a school, an office, a public space, on a hillside or in a mangrove by a tree steward.
Anyone in Freetown can opt to be a tree steward.
And the growth of the trees will be tracked by our community-based growing teams using our custom-made Treetracker app.
This isn't just about planting trees, it's about growing trees, and it's about ensuring that each one of us is part of the process.
A million trees will not fix climate change. But they will reduce the risk of landslides and flooding, and they will reintroduce biodiversity -- I've already seen the butterflies back in the park.
And they will protect our water catchments.
A million trees is our city's small contribution to increasing the much-needed global carbon sink.
Perhaps you should plant some trees, too.

You’ve filled up your cart and made it to the front of the grocery line when you’re confronted with yet another choice: what kind of bag should you use?
If you’ve seen the images of plastic bags strewn across the ocean, it might seem obvious that plastic is bad for the environment.
Surely a paper bag or a cotton tote would be the better option.
But is that really true?
Each of these three materials has a unique environmental impact that’s determined by its carbon footprint, its potential to be reused and recycled, and its degradability.
So, to get the full story on these grocery bags we need to look at how they’re made, how they’re used, and where they ultimately go.
Let’s start with plastic.
The typical thin and flimsy plastic bag is made of high-density polyethylene, commonly known as HDPE.
Producing this material requires extracting petroleum from the ground and applying extreme heat.
Here, coal powered machines melt the materials down and spin them into sheets of plastic, which are then folded into bags.
Paper is made from wood pulp, and when you account for the carbon cost of removing trees from their ecosystems, a single paper bag can be responsible for about 5.5 kg of carbon dioxide.
The production of a single cotton tote emits an estimated 272 kg of carbon dioxide. When we compare carbon footprints, plastic bags are the clear winner.
But environmental impact is also determined by how the bag is used.
But even when they’re made to avoid tearing, their widespread availability makes it easy to treat them as single-use items.
Whenever these bags aren’t recycled, the third factor in calculating environmental impact comes into play: degradability.
So, which bag should you use?
These sturdy shopping bags consist of polyester, vinyl and other tough plastics, and are already used worldwide.
Surely a paper bag or a cotton tote would be the better option.
But the alternatives actually possess a much larger carbon footprint.
Meanwhile, growing cotton is an extremely energy and water intensive process.
For example, if a typical paper bag is reused three times, it has a lower net impact than a single-use plastic bag.
The carbon footprint of a cotton tote can similarly be lowered, if it’s reused 131 times.
Of these three options, durable cloth totes are most likely to be reused.
Evidence shows paper bags are quickly discarded due to their tendency to tear.
This issue plagues HDPE plastic bags as well.
But even when they’re made to avoid tearing, their widespread availability makes it easy to treat them as single-use items.
Fortunately, researchers estimate that 40% of HDPE bags are reused at least once for throwing out waste.
Recycling these bags also offsets their carbon footprint, but it’s not universally possible for each material.
Many countries lack the infrastructure to efficiently recycle plastic bags.
Cotton totes are perhaps even more difficult to breakdown and process, but since they’re often reused for long periods, they’re still least likely to end up in landfills.
Whenever these bags aren’t recycled, the third factor in calculating environmental impact comes into play: degradability.
Since HDPE bags are heat-resistant and insoluble, they stick around long after we’re done with them.
Partially broken down plastic can circulate in ecosystems for centuries.
Cotton on the other hand degrades substantially in a matter of months, and paper bags break down completely in just 90 days.
So, which bag should you use?
It turns out the most environmentally friendly bags have features of several materials we've discussed.
They’re durable and reusable, like cotton, but made of plastic, which has a lower carbon footprint than cotton or paper.
These sturdy shopping bags consist of polyester, vinyl and other tough plastics, and are already used worldwide.
Most importantly, they should last a lifetime— making them the best option for the planet, and your groceries.
The air smelled smoky and sulfurous.
I just stepped off a rickety train to Korba, deep in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, and home to a dozen coal power plants and India's largest open-pit coal mine. There it is, a literal hellscape, complete with infernal fires that burn 24/7. But, in Korba, coal is life.
Most people I talked to accepted that the coal economy powers their livelihoods, but it is slowly killing them.
Here's a community next door to a coal plant.
They wake every morning to homes coated in a fresh layer of ash from the smoke that the plant belches.
Korba is one of the most critically polluted places on the planet. And it's not just coal country that's hurting, all of India has a deadly addiction to fossil fuels.
India's home to 22 of the world's 30 most polluted places on the planet.
In Delhi, the capital, residents lose 9.4 years off their life expectancy on average.
In 2020, the skies briefly cleared during the coronavirus lockdown, as cars stayed off the roads, factories shuttered and power plants ramped down. But the economic dislocation has put 400 million Indians at risk of falling deeper into poverty.
India should not have to sacrifice development for breathable air.
There is a better way.
For India has a historic opportunity to industrialize using clean energy.
That opportunity is why I moved halfway around the world from the US to India to join ReNew Power, India's largest renewable energy company, as CTO.
After two years of crisscrossing the country, I've seen green shoots everywhere, of a budding clean energy boom, daring me to hope that India can pull off the world's most important energy transition.
Its choices will make or break the world's fight against climate change, for if India chooses fossil fuels to power its growing economy, its carbon emissions could explode, making it the world's number one emitter later this century.
Still, for most Indians fossil fuels are a luxury.
Most live in rural areas, and wood, cow dung and bioenergy sources account for two-thirds of household energy use.
Just six percent of Indians own cars, and two percent have air conditioning.
Indians will need far more energy to escape poverty and live modern, dignified lifestyles.
By 2050 most will live in cities, and they'll want to drive to work and cool their homes.
Along the way, India will become the world's most populous country, home to 1.6 billion people by mid-century.
Its economy could multiply tenfold; its energy needs could quadruple.
Today, coal, oil and gas supply three-quarters of India's energy, producing electricity, fueling vehicles and powering India's factories.
If, by 2050, India still gets the same proportion from fossil fuels, it'll be a disaster for everyone, not least local populations, vulnerable to pollution, climate change or rapacious new coal mining.
Instead, India can make renewable energy the beating heart of a reimagined economy by achieving three audacious goals all at the same time.
It's a route no country in history has ever taken, but it is possible, and this moment demands it.
Fortunately, India is blessed with abundant sunshine.
In theory, you could supply all of its energy needs by tapping the sunlight that shines on less than 10 percent of India's wastelands.
This is the critical decade to invest in solar and wind power and avoid locking in new, long-lived coal power plants.
India's road vehicle fleet can also go electric.
Now, to be clear, we're mostly not talking about these electric vehicles, but these.
That presents a huge opportunity to enact stringent efficiency standards and design energy-efficient buildings and cities.
Finally, coal isn't going away without a fight. It's big business in India.
Near Korba, India's coal capital, private companies are pushing ahead to expand coal mining, even deforesting an elephant preserve to dig out the coal underneath.
I witnessed the destruction firsthand. But for every Korba there is a Kutch.
In this wind-swept region of Gujarat, I gaped as construction crews hoisted 70-ton nacelles atop towers taller than a football field is long.
The wind turbine blades are manufactured in India, and the electricity they'll go on to generate will help power economic growth.
Renewable energy offers India a cleaner and more prosperous future than coal ever can. Unless we hasten the transition, air pollution and climate change will continue to ravage the country and endanger the planet.
So, let's get to work.
Thank you.The air smelled smoky and sulfurous.

If, by 2050, India still gets the same proportion from fossil fuels, it'll be a disaster for everyone, not least local populations, vulnerable to pollution, climate change or rapacious new coal mining.
Instead, India can make renewable energy the beating heart of a reimagined economy by achieving three audacious goals all at the same time.
It's a route no country in history has ever taken, but it is possible, and this moment demands it.
First, India will need to build solar and wind power at an unprecedented scale and speed, replacing coal-fired power plants.
Second, India will need to extend the reach of that renewable energy to power sectors of the economy like industry and transportation that haven't traditionally used electricity. And third, India must become radically more energy-efficient.
Here's my plan to achieve all three goals.
First, India must build thousands of gigawatts of solar and wind power.
To put this in context, it will be more than enough renewable energy to power all of America.
Fortunately, India is blessed with abundant sunshine.
In theory, you could supply all of its energy needs by tapping the sunlight that shines on less than 10 percent of India's wastelands.
India also has substantial untapped wind potential on land and offshore.
Wind and solar complement each other because the wind often blows harder when it's less sunny, like during the monsoon rains.
Here's some even more exciting news: Wind and solar power are now cheaper than coal power, and it costs less to build a solar farm in India than anywhere else in the world.
Batteries have also become dramatically cheaper, making it possible to store and deliver energy on demand.
Thanks to falling costs, renewable energy has risen rapidly, but it will need to grow even more explosively through mid-century.
This is the critical decade to invest in solar and wind power and avoid locking in new, long-lived coal power plants.
India must also urgently expand its grid to deliver power for massive solar and wind plants in the sun-soaked deserts of Rajasthan or the windy coast of Gujarat, to energy-hungry cities like Mumbai.
Not all renewables should be built at massive scale. Distributed solar, on the rooftops of warehouses or the outskirts of sprawling cities, can produce power close to where it's needed.
Now, to be sure, nuclear and hydropower will be essential to energy transitions around the world.
But India simply lacks the state capacity needed to build complex pricey projects at a breakneck pace, and all that push to build renewable wind and solar power best plays to India's strengths.
The second audacious goal is to use renewable energy across the economy, including in sectors like industry and transportation that don't use electricity today.
As rising renewable energy makes the power grid cleaner, India should make all of its trains run on electricity and move more heavy freight from heavy trucks to rail.
India's road vehicle fleet can also go electric.
Now, to be clear, we're mostly not talking about these electric vehicles, but these.
Two- and three-wheelers make up more than 80 percent of India's vehicle fleet.
To accelerate the adoption of electric scooters and rickshaws, India should build out charging stations and beef up local power grids to handle the influx of electricity demand.
Still, electrification won't work everywhere.
It may not be possible to use electricity to power some heavy industrial processes in the fast-growing steel, cement, fertilizer and petrochemical sectors.
Plants may need to add equipment to capture carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.
Another solution could be clean hydrogen.
Surplus renewable electricity can run machines called electrolyzers that can split water into oxygen and green hydrogen fuel. That hydrogen can then power applications in transportation and industry, such as making steel or chemicals.
Hydrogen can also act as a sort of battery, storing surplus wind and solar power to be used later.
Finally, the third goal is to radically improve energy efficiency. If there's any country in the world where efficiency is all-important, it's India.
Even if India builds a massive supply of renewable energy and extends the reach of that energy by stitching together its economy, it won't be enough without energy efficiency.
Because if India's voracious demand for energy rises too quickly, it'll have to fill the gap with polluting fossil fuels.
But far more efficient air conditioners could make it possible to power the aspirations of a rising middle class with renewable energy.
India's big advantage is that it's largely a clean slate. An incredible 70 percent of India's infrastructure in 2030 hasn't been built yet.
That presents a huge opportunity to enact stringent efficiency standards and design energy-efficient buildings and cities.
Still, there are warning signs that India's energy transition could sputter out.
COVID-19 sharply slowed the building of new renewable energy plants. Even larger challenges loom.
First, India's electricity distribution utilities are mismanaged, economically fragile and forced by many states to subsidize power to farmers and residential customers.
India needs reforms to more efficiently combat energy poverty while overhauling unprofitable utilities so they can pay for clean energy on time.
Doing so will make it possible to raise trillions of dollars at home and abroad to finance India's clean energy transition.
Second, that transition will stall without new and improved technologies.
Countries like the United States should help fund public procurement of advanced air conditioners and partner to build projects on the ground in India that demonstrate critical technologies, such as long-duration energy storage and carbon capture.
Finally, coal isn't going away without a fight. It's big business in India.
So, let's get to work.
On August 12, 2020, two groups of girls went out to protest in Minsk, the capital city of Belarus.
They put on white clothes and went barefoot out into the street.
In the morning, some went to Komarovskiy Market in the center of town.
Later that day, the other group gathered with flowers at the eternal flame under the victory monument.
And yet they did it anyway.
Fearlessness takes two.
It only works if and when we show up for each other.
I was threatened and forced to believe that I'm alone in this fight.
And yet the more cities I visited, the more people showed up for the rallies, the less fear I had.
When there are two of you, you are daring.
They stood together holding hands, and they started to sing the Belarusian lullaby, waiting for the police cars to arrive.
Within just a few days, a few hundred thousand people took to the streets and demonstrations have continued ever since, the likes of which Belarus has never seen before.
All this despite the fact that the president proclaimed himself reelected and that more than 10,000 people have been detained, hundreds tortured and at least six killed.
Many people wonder why the people of Belarus are speaking up now.
What makes them keep taking to the streets despite unprecedented police violence, despite state lawlessness?
The answer I hear the most is that people have become fearless, and it's something we have become together.
Because fear is the province of one.
It feeds on isolation.
It doesn't discriminate: men, women, children, elderly -- all of us can feel fear, but only as long as we are on our own.
Fearlessness takes two.
It only works if and when we show up for each other.
Show up so that your neighbor, your colleague, your friend has courage.
And they will do the same for you.
But there were many moments when I was frightened, and I wanted to step down.
I was threatened and forced to believe that I'm alone in this fight.
And yet the more cities I visited, the more people showed up for the rallies, the less fear I had.
And then in the days before the election in Minsk, 60,000 people came to show their support for me, and I was no longer afraid.
I never wanted to do any of this.
I was never overly political, and I never planned to run for office.
I wanted to be a mom and a wife.
But by fate and the will of my people, I was elevated to this position.
And I accept this with a sense of duty and pride.
I will not give up.
And I will show up for people, because they show up for me.
Our courage is born from unity.
Our solidarity is our strength.
I also now understand that being fearless is a commitment.
It is a decision you make every single day.
It is a responsibility you take -- responsibility for one another.
In this regard, I'm no different from my fellow Belarusians.
Their support is tangible.
Their solidarity grows in progression.
When there are two of you, you are daring.
When you're 100, you are brave.
When there are thousands of you, you are fearless.
And once you are tens of thousands, you become invincible.
Thank you.
I am a tree hugger.
I spent much of my childhood on the great lower limb of a massive copper beech, alternately reading and looking up at the sky through its branches.
I felt safe and cared for and connected to something infinitely larger than myself.
I thought the trees were immortal, that they would always be here.
But I was wrong.
The trees are dying.
Climate change is killing the cedars of Lebanon and the forests of the American West.
And it's not just the trees.
Since 1998, extreme heat has killed more than 160,000 people, and unchecked climate change could kill millions more.
How did we get here?
There are many reasons, of course, but one of the most important is that we let capitalism morph into something monstrous.
I'm a huge fan of capitalism at its best.
After all, I'm an economist and a business school professor.
I think genuinely free and fair markets are one of the great inventions of the human race.
But here's the catch: markets only work their magic when prices reflect real costs.
And right now, prices are badly out of whack.
We're letting the firms who sell fossil fuels, and indeed anyone who emits greenhouse gases, cause enormous damage for which they do not have to pay. And that is hardly fair.
Imagine for a moment that my hands are filled with a cloud of electrons, 10 dollars' worth of coal-fired electricity that could power your cell phone for more than 10 years.
That probably sounds like a pretty good deal.
But it's only so cheap because you're not paying for the harm that it causes.
Burning coal sends poisons like mercury and lead into the air, increasing healthcare costs by billions of dollars and causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people every year.
It also emits huge quantities of carbon dioxide.
So another part of the real cost of coal is the climate damage it will cause and is already causing. More than a million acres burned in California this summer, and massive floods put a third of Bangladesh under water.
Hundreds of studies have tried to put a number on these costs.
So the true cost of this handful of electrons? It's not 10 dollars.
It's something more like 26. The hidden costs of doing things like burning oil and gas and eating beef are similarly enormous and just as unfair.
Everyone who's trying to build a clean economy has to compete with firms that are heavily subsidized by the destruction of our health and the degradation of our climate.
This is not the capitalism I signed up for.
This is not a market that is either free or fair.
So . . . What do we do?
The "easy" answer is that governments should insist that anyone who emits greenhouse gases pay for the damage that they cause.
However, at the moment, there's not much sign that governments are up for this, partly because the fossil fuel companies have spent the last 20 years using their heavily subsidized profits to deny the reality of climate change and to shower the politicians, who should be regulating them, with money.
So here's my crazy idea.
I think business should step up.
I think business should fix capitalism.
I know. (Laughs) Some of you are probably thinking, "Fat chance.
" Didn't I just say that companies are the ones denying the science, distorting the market and lobbying the politicians?
I did.
But fixing this is squarely in the private sector's interest.
The truth is business is screwed if we don't fix climate change.
So let me tell you what this looks like on the ground.
My friend Erik Osmundsen left a cushy job in private equity to become the CEO of a garbage company.
That sounds like a slightly odd idea. But Erik wanted to make a difference, and changing the way that trash is handled could reduce emissions by billions of tons.
Right away, he ran into a massive problem: the industry was thoroughly corrupt.
Firms were cutting costs by dumping waste illegally, the regulations were poorly enforced and the fines for violation were tiny.
Erik announced he was going to run clean and to raise prices to cover the costs of doing so.
Many of his senior team thought he was crazy.
Half of them quit.
So did many of his customers.
His competitors denounced him for bringing the industry into disrepute, and he started to receive personal threats.
But corruption works best when it's hidden.
As soon as Erik went public, people started to step up.
A few customers were willing to pay more.
His investors agreed that taking the high road could pay off.
Those of his employees who remained loved the idea of taking a stand and found all kinds of legal ways to cut costs.
Erik persuaded several of his competitors to join him in refusing to dispose of garbage illegally, and it got much tougher for regulators to stay on the sidelines.
Today, Erik's company, Norsk Gjenvinning, is one of the largest recycling companies in Scandinavia.
Let me generalize.
These are the four pillars of change: Build a business that can set the right price and still be profitable.
Persuade your competitors to do the same thing.
Make sure that investors understand there's money to be made.
And push governments to put the right price into law so that bottom-feeders can't survive.
I'm not telling you we've got this nailed.
Things are pretty desperate.
But there are thousands of businesspeople like Erik, and there are millions of people like us. And we are customers, employees, investors and citizens.
Instead of giving up on capitalism, let's fix it by making sure that markets are truly fair and truly free, and that no one can dump garbage on us and walk away without paying for it.
We have the resources and the technology to solve climate change.
Together, we can save the trees and each other.
Thank you.I am a tree hugger.

Essentially, what the company was doing was creating a medical device where you would be able to run your entire blood panel on a finger-stick of blood.
So you wouldn't have to get a big needle stuck in your arm in order to get your blood test done.
If you had a device that allowed for more frequent and continuous diagnosis, potentially, you could diagnose disease before someone got sick.
" Before I went to university, I had grown up in a one-bedroom trailer with my six family members, and when I told people I wanted to go to Berkeley, they would say, "Well, I want to be an astronaut, so good luck.
I was robbed at gunpoint, I was sexually assaulted, and I was sexually assaulted a third time, spurring on very severe panic attacks, where I was failing my classes, and I dropped out of school.
" And I told myself, "You know what? If I don't make the cut, I don't make the cut, but I cannot give up on myself, and I'm going to go for this, and even if I'm not the best for it, I'm going to try and make it happen.
" So because we were seeing so many issues with the Theranos device that was actively being used to test on patients, what we had done is we had taken the sample and we had run it through an FDA-approved machine and we had run it through the Theranos device.
And guess what happened?
We got two very, very different results.
So what do you think they did in this scenario?
You would anticipate that you would tell the regulators, like, "We have some discrepancies here with this new technology.
" But instead, Theranos had sent the result of the FDA-approved machine.
So what does this signal to you?
This signals to you that even within your own organization, you don't trust the results that your technology is producing.
So how do we have any business running patient samples on this particular machine?
So of course, you know, I am a recent grad, I have, at this point, run all these different experiments, I've compiled all this evidence, and I'd gone into the office of the COO and I was raising my concerns.
"Within the lab, we're seeing a lot of variability.
The accuracy rate doesn't seem right.
I don't feel right about testing on patients.
These things, I'm just not comfortable with.
" And the response I got back is, "You don't know what you're talking about.
" What you need to do is what I'm paying you to do, and you need to process patient samples.
" So that night, I called up a colleague of mine who I had befriended within the organization, Tyler Shultz, who also happened to have a grandfather who was on the Board of Directors.
And so we had decided to go to his grandfather's house and tell him, at dinner, what the company was telling him was going on was actually not what was happening behind closed doors.
So you can imagine me as a 20-something-year-old just shaking, like, "What are you getting yourself into?
" And he says to us, "I know Tyler's very smart, you seem very smart, but the fact of the matter is I've brought in a wealth of intelligent people, and they tell me that this device is going to revolutionize health care.
And so maybe you should consider doing something else.
" So this had gone through a period of about seven months, and I decided to quit that very next day.
And this -- (Applause and cheers) But this was a moment that I had to sit with myself and do a bit of a mental health check.
I'd raised concerns in the lab. I'd raised concerns with the COO. I had raised concerns with a board member.
And meanwhile, Elizabeth is on the cover of every major magazine across America.
So there's one common thread here, and that's me. Maybe I'm the problem?
Maybe there's something that I'm not seeing?
Maybe I'm the crazy one.
And this is the part in my story where I really get lucky.
I was approached by a very talented journalist, John Carreyrou from the Wall Street Journal, and he -- And he had basically said that he also had heard concerns about the company from other people in the industry and working for the company.
And in that moment, it clicked in my head: "Erika, you are not crazy.
You're not the crazy one.
In fact, there are other people out there just like you that are just as scared of coming forward, but see the same problems and the same concerns that you do.
And the scary thing, really, for me in this instance was the fact that it triggered, and I realized that they were following me once I received this letter, but it was also, in a way, a bit of a blessing, because it forced me to call a lawyer.
And I was lucky enough -- I called a free lawyer, but he had suggested, "Why don't you report to a regulatory agency?
" And this was something that didn't even click in my head, probably because I was so inexperienced, but once that happened, that's exactly what I did.
I had decided to write a letter, and a complaint letter, to regulators, illustrating all the deficiencies and the problems that I had seen in the laboratory.
And as endearingly as my dad kind of notes this as being my, like, dragon-slayer moment, where I had risen up and fought this behemoth and it caused this domino effect, I can tell you right now, I felt anything but courageous.
I was scared, I was terrified, I was anxious, I was ashamed, slightly, that it took me a month to write the letter.
There was a glimmer of hope in there that maybe somehow no one would ever figure out that it was me.
But despite all that emotion and all that volatility, I still did it, and luckily, it triggered an investigation that shown to light that there were huge deficiencies in the lab, and it stopped Theranos from processing patient samples.
(Applause) So you would hope, going through a very challenging and crazy situation like this, that I would be able to sort of culminate some how-tos or recipe for success for other people that are in this situation.
But frankly, when it comes to situations like this, the only quote that kind of gets it right is this Mike Tyson quote that says, "Everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth.
" (Laughter) And that's exactly how this is.
But today, you know, we're here to kind of convene on moon shots, and moon shots are these highly innovative projects that are very ambitious, that everyone wants to believe in.
But what happens when the vision is so compelling and the desire to believe is so strong that it starts to cloud your judgment about what reality is?
And particularly when these innovative projects start to be a detriment to society, what are the mechanisms in place in which we can prevent these potential consequences?
And really, in my mind, the simplest way to do that is to foster stronger cultures of people who speak up and listening to those who speak up.
So now the big question is, how do we make speaking up the norm and not the exception?
(Applause and cheers) So luckily, in my own experience, I realized that when it comes to speaking up, the action tends to be pretty straightforward in most cases, but the hard part is really deciding whether to act or not.
So how do we frame our decisions in a way that makes it easier for us to act and produce more ethical outcomes?
So UC San Diego came up with this excellent framework called the "Three Cs," and it's called commitment, consciousness and competency.
And commitment is the desire to do the right thing regardless of the cost.
In my case at Theranos, if I was wrong, I was going to have to pay the consequences.
But if I was right, the fact that I could have been a person that knew what was going on and didn't say something, that was purgatory.
Being silent was purgatory.
And competency is the ability to collect and evaluate information and foresee potential consequences and risk.
And the reason I could trust my competency was because I was acting in service of others.
And at the time, there wasn't really that much information about the company, but the little that was there was really impressive.
Essentially, what the company was doing was creating a medical device where you would be able to run your entire blood panel on a finger-stick of blood.
If you had a device that allowed for more frequent and continuous diagnosis, potentially, you could diagnose disease before someone got sick.
And this was confirmed in an interview that the founder, Elizabeth Holmes, had said in the Wall Street Journal.
"The reality within our health-care system today is that when someone you care about gets really sick, by the time you find out it's [most often] too late to do anything about it, It's heartbreaking.
" This was a moon shot that I really wanted to be a part of and I really wanted to help build.
So there was a time that someone had said to me, "Erika, there are two types of people.
" Before I went to university, I had grown up in a one-bedroom trailer with my six family members, and when I told people I wanted to go to Berkeley, they would say, "Well, I want to be an astronaut, so good luck.
I was robbed at gunpoint, I was sexually assaulted, and I was sexually assaulted a third time, spurring on very severe panic attacks, where I was failing my classes, and I dropped out of school.
" And luckily, I stuck with it, and I got the degree, and I graduated.
And this was something, for me, personally, that I had to believe in my life, because it was one of the few anchors that I had had that got me through the day.
And deleting a data point is really violating one of the things that I found so beautiful about the scientific process -- it really allows the data to reveal the truth to you.
So this, to me, was almost immediately a red flag, and it kind of folded in to the next experience and the next red flag that I started to see within the clinical laboratory.
And guess what happened?
So what does this signal to you?
This signals to you that even within your own organization, you don't trust the results that your technology is producing.
So how do we have any business running patient samples on this particular machine?
So of course, you know, I am a recent grad, I have, at this point, run all these different experiments, I've compiled all this evidence, and I'd gone into the office of the COO and I was raising my concerns.
"Within the lab, we're seeing a lot of variability.
The accuracy rate doesn't seem right.
I don't feel right about testing on patients.
These things, I'm just not comfortable with.
" And the response I got back is, "You don't know what you're talking about.
" What you need to do is what I'm paying you to do, and you need to process patient samples.
" So that night, I called up a colleague of mine who I had befriended within the organization, Tyler Shultz, who also happened to have a grandfather who was on the Board of Directors.
And so we had decided to go to his grandfather's house and tell him, at dinner, what the company was telling him was going on was actually not what was happening behind closed doors.
And not to mention, Tyler's grandfather was George Schultz, the ex-secretary of state of the United States.
So you can imagine me as a 20-something-year-old just shaking, like, "What are you getting yourself into?
" And he says to us, "I know Tyler's very smart, you seem very smart, but the fact of the matter is I've brought in a wealth of intelligent people, and they tell me that this device is going to revolutionize health care.
And so maybe you should consider doing something else.
" So this had gone through a period of about seven months, and I decided to quit that very next day.
And this -- (Applause and cheers) But this was a moment that I had to sit with myself and do a bit of a mental health check.
I'd raised concerns in the lab. I'd raised concerns with the COO. I had raised concerns with a board member.
And meanwhile, Elizabeth is on the cover of every major magazine across America.
So there's one common thread here, and that's me. Maybe I'm the problem?
Maybe there's something that I'm not seeing?
Maybe I'm the crazy one.
And this is the part in my story where I really get lucky.
I was approached by a very talented journalist, John Carreyrou from the Wall Street Journal, and he -- And he had basically said that he also had heard concerns about the company from other people in the industry and working for the company.
And in that moment, it clicked in my head: "Erika, you are not crazy.
You're not the crazy one.
In fact, there are other people out there just like you that are just as scared of coming forward, but see the same problems and the same concerns that you do.
And the scary thing, really, for me in this instance was the fact that it triggered, and I realized that they were following me once I received this letter, but it was also, in a way, a bit of a blessing, because it forced me to call a lawyer.
And I was lucky enough -- I called a free lawyer, but he had suggested, "Why don't you report to a regulatory agency?
" And this was something that didn't even click in my head, probably because I was so inexperienced, but once that happened, that's exactly what I did.
I had decided to write a letter, and a complaint letter, to regulators, illustrating all the deficiencies and the problems that I had seen in the laboratory.
And as endearingly as my dad kind of notes this as being my, like, dragon-slayer moment, where I had risen up and fought this behemoth and it caused this domino effect, I can tell you right now, I felt anything but courageous.
I was scared, I was terrified, I was anxious, I was ashamed, slightly, that it took me a month to write the letter.
There was a glimmer of hope in there that maybe somehow no one would ever figure out that it was me.
But despite all that emotion and all that volatility, I still did it, and luckily, it triggered an investigation that shown to light that there were huge deficiencies in the lab, and it stopped Theranos from processing patient samples.
(Applause) So you would hope, going through a very challenging and crazy situation like this, that I would be able to sort of culminate some how-tos or recipe for success for other people that are in this situation.
But frankly, when it comes to situations like this, the only quote that kind of gets it right is this Mike Tyson quote that says, "Everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth.
" (Laughter) And that's exactly how this is.
But today, you know, we're here to kind of convene on moon shots, and moon shots are these highly innovative projects that are very ambitious, that everyone wants to believe in.
But what happens when the vision is so compelling and the desire to believe is so strong that it starts to cloud your judgment about what reality is?
And particularly when these innovative projects start to be a detriment to society, what are the mechanisms in place in which we can prevent these potential consequences?
And really, in my mind, the simplest way to do that is to foster stronger cultures of people who speak up and listening to those who speak up.
So now the big question is, how do we make speaking up the norm and not the exception?
So how do we frame our decisions in a way that makes it easier for us to act and produce more ethical outcomes?
So UC San Diego came up with this excellent framework called the "Three Cs," and it's called commitment, consciousness and competency.
And commitment is the desire to do the right thing regardless of the cost.
And the third aspect is competency.
Think about this.
Rich countries have that kind of energy, whereas most countries in Africa, and many elsewhere simply don't.
That's what I want to talk about today.
That's non-negotiable.
In other words, Africa must be allowed to, yes, produce more carbon in the short term so we can grow, while the rich world needs to drastically cut their emissions.
We also understand very well that the entire world needs to get to a zero-carbon future.
This might sound contradictory, but consider these three points.
First, Africa isn't the culprit of climate change.
It's a victim.
Africa and its more than one billion people are among the most vulnerable to climate change on the planet, facing the worst impacts of extreme weather, drought and heat.
And yet, if you look at the carbon footprint of the entire African continent, 48 African countries combined are responsible for less than one percent of accumulative carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Even if every one of the one billion people in sub-Saharan Africa tripled their electricity consumption overnight, and if all of that new power came from natural gas-fired plants, we estimate that the additional CO2 that Africa would add would equal to just one percent of total global emissions.
Second, Africa needs more energy to fight climate change, not less.
Because of its climate vulnerability, Africa's climate fight is about adaptation and resilience, and climate adaptation is energy-intensive.
To respond to extreme weather, Africans will need more resilient infrastructure.
We're talking seawalls, highways, safe buildings and more.
To cope with drought, Africans will need pumped irrigation for their agriculture, and many will need desalination for fresh water.
And to survive soaring temperatures, Africans will need cold storage and ACs in hundreds of millions of homes, offices, warehouses, factories, data centers and the like.
These are all energy-intensive activities.
If we fail at mitigation, the rich countries' plan B for climate change is to simply adapt.
Africans need and deserve that same capacity for adaptation.
Third, imposing mitigation on the world's poor is widening economic inequality.
" That viewpoint is worse than patronizing.
It's a form of racism, and it's creating a two-tier, global energy system with energy abundance for the rich and tiny solar lamps for Africans.
The global market for natural gas is a great example of this.
Large Western companies are actively developing gas fields in African countries to run industry and generate electricity in Asia or in Europe.
And yet, when these same African countries want to build power plants at home to use gas for their own people, the Western development and finance communities say, "No, we won't fund that.
" And here's the irony.
Many poor countries are already far ahead of the West when it comes to transitioning to a low-carbon energy system.
In Kenya, where I'm from, we generate most of our electricity carbon-free.
Renewable sources such as geothermal, hydro and wind provide nearly 80 percent of our electricity.
In the US, that figure is only 17 percent.
So let me repeat my points.
Everyone must get to a zero-carbon future.
In the transition, Africa and other poor nations deserve to get the balance of what's remaining in the world's carbon budget.
For economic competitiveness, for climate adaptation, for global stability and for economic justice, rich and high-emitting countries must uphold their responsibility to lead on decarbonization, starting in their own economies.
We all have a collective responsibility to turn the tide on climate change.
If we fail, it won't be because Senegal or Kenya or Benin or Mali decided to build a handful of natural gas power plants to provide economic opportunity for their people.
Thank you.Think about this.
Californians use more electricity playing video games than the entire country of Senegal uses overall.
Also, before gyms were shut down due to COVID, New Yorkers could work out in a 10-degree-Celsius gym because the cold apparently burns more calories.
And yet only three percent of Nigerians have air conditioners.
As you can see, there's a mind-blowing gap between the energy haves and the energy have-nots.
And across the globe, we have incredible energy inequality.
Rich countries have that kind of energy, whereas most countries in Africa, and many elsewhere simply don't.
And those billions of people are falling further and further behind the rest of the world.
In addition to taking their energy abundance for granted, the wealthy take something else for granted: that everyone should fight climate change exactly the same way.
Tackling climate change will require an accelerated transition to low-carbon energy sources.
And yet, emissions continue to climb year after year, threatening to blow our tight carbon budget.
That's what I want to talk about today.
The carbon budget is an estimation of the total emissions that our planet's atmosphere can safely absorb.
Faced with an imperative to not explode this carbon budget, the world is looking at Africa in a completely contradictory way.
On one side, it wants us to grow, to emerge from abject poverty, to build a middle class, to own cars and air conditioners and other modern amenities because after all, Africa is the next global market.
On the other side, because they are anxious to demonstrate action on climate change, rich countries in the West are increasingly restricting their funding to only renewable energy sources, effectively telling Africa and other poor nations to either develop with no carbon or to limit their development ambitions altogether.
Africa obviously needs to develop.
That's non-negotiable.
And I want to make the case today that Africa must be prioritized when it comes to what's left in the carbon budget.
In other words, Africa must be allowed to, yes, produce more carbon in the short term so we can grow, while the rich world needs to drastically cut their emissions.
Africans have a right to aspire to the same prosperity that everyone else enjoys.
And we deserve the same chance at a job, at an education, at dignity and opportunity.
We also understand very well that the entire world needs to get to a zero-carbon future.
This might sound contradictory, but consider these three points.
First, Africa isn't the culprit of climate change.
It's a victim.

If we fail at mitigation, the rich countries' plan B for climate change is to simply adapt.
Africans need and deserve that same capacity for adaptation.
Third, imposing mitigation on the world's poor is widening economic inequality.
We're creating energy apartheid.
Working in global energy and development, I often hear people say, "Because of climate, we just can't afford for everyone to live our lifestyles.
" That viewpoint is worse than patronizing.
It's a form of racism, and it's creating a two-tier, global energy system with energy abundance for the rich and tiny solar lamps for Africans.

Thank you.
Wales is a small but progressive country, the only country in the world to have legislated to protect the interests of future generations, the only country to have appointed someone independent to oversee this.
Across the world, our systems of government, of politics, of economics have tended to act in the short term.
And often, the decisions that are taken discount the interests of future generations and the planet.
But in Wales, we're trying to change that by passing a law which requires not just our government but all of our main public institutions to demonstrate how they're acting for the long-term and how the decisions they take don't harm the interests of those yet to be born.
And so as a mum of five and the world's only future generations commissioner, I want to share with you today some of the lessons we've learned about how we're trying to leave the world better than we found it.
First of all, you must involve people in setting long-term goals.
Ask them: What's the Wales or the world you want to leave behind to your children and your grandchildren?
We held a national conversation -- the Wales We Want -- and people told us, "We want a low-carbon economy.
We want you to help us keep people well rather than just treat them when they're ill.
We want connected communities and a more equal Wales. " And our government legislated to set seven national well-being goals to achieve that.
Each institution has to demonstrate how they're meeting those goals, and they're held to account by me.
You have to focus on the interconnections between different aspects of well-being.
You need to talk often about why it's just as important to public health as it is to the environment to tackle high levels of air pollution, why diversity in the workforce is just as important to economic prosperity as it is to addressing inequality.
Our institutions have a legal duty to act beyond their immediate remit to recognize those connections, work with unusual suspects.
And so we're seeing hospitals in Wales working with the National Botanic Gardens to create spaces for nature on their sites.
We're seeing offices in our environmental agency helping to find solutions to tackle childhood adversity.
Make well-being your metrics.
Test everything you do across the four pillars of well-being: social, economic, environmental and cultural.
Because for too long, governments have tested their success on the measures of economic growth and increases in GVA.
But in Wales, our measures of success are around our seven well-being goals.
And so that's what they're doing.
Make it your mission to maximize your contribution to well-being.
So when we're seeing plans for economic stimulus in green jobs and energy efficiency measures in homes post-COVID, they're really good ideas.
But make sure you target those jobs towards those furthest from the labor market, because otherwise, you'll be missing opportunities to address inequality, too.
Think about your projects holistically.
Don't save carbon by putting solar panels on your new hospital and then spend it in another area by failing to consider how patients are going to travel there sustainably.
Well, in Cardiff, our capital city, like many others across the world, we're blighted by high levels of air pollution, long commutes, congested roads and big differences in life expectancy between the richest and the poorest.
So what is our act doing to make a difference?
Well, first of all, it requires our public institutions to work together.
And so, as a result, the public health consultant was seconded from the health board to the local council to lead on the transportation strategy.
And when you apply a public health lens to a transport problem, you get a different set of solutions.
The public institutions realized that between them, they were employing 30,000 people in Cardiff, so they're now incentivizing their employees to travel sustainably.
We've seen a tenfold increase in investment in safe routes to cycle and to walk, and we've targeted that cycling and walking infrastructure towards those neighborhoods who have the highest level of air pollution and the lowest life expectancy.
And in Cardiff, doctors can issue prescriptions, not just for statins, but for free bike hire for those who would benefit from increasing their physical activity.
And when we've constructed our cycling infrastructure, we've also built in sustainable drainage, taking away over 40,000 cubic meters of water from an unsustainable drainage system through nature-based solutions.
And in doing that, we've created sites for nature, we've cleaned and greened communities, and we've transformed concrete jungles.
And when you travel from this area to our city center, you'll be met with areas which are closed off to traffic, where people can meet and businesses can trade outside the splendor of our medieval castle.
So this is how we're embedding well-being in what we do in Wales.
This is how we're protecting the interests of future generations.
This is how we're acting today for a better tomorrow.Wales is a small but progressive country, the only country in the world to have legislated to protect the interests of future generations, the only country to have appointed someone independent to oversee this.

Nature reveals itself to us in unique ways, if we stop and look at the world through a window of time.
Over the last decade, I've observed endangered species and habitats around the world, using a photographic technique that captures the passage of time, literally from day to night, all within a single image.
It has allowed me to witness the fleeting moments between wildlife and the natural habitat as time changes over the course of a single day.
In the Serengeti, during a five-week drought, I discovered a watering hole and watched, for 26 hours, diverse and competitive wildlife calmly share our planet's most precious resource: water.
On Lake Bogoria in Kenya, I photographed the great migration of flamingos.
This happens normally during the peak of dry season, but climate change has created evening thunderstorms, turning normally dry hills green and creating freshwater streams in which the flamingos joyously bathe.
Our planet is changing before our eyes.
But to witness that change is also to witness the remarkable relationships between all of nature, to see the infinite beauty of it, to learn how much bigger than us it is and why it is worth fighting for.
In 2019, the Greenland ice sheet was experiencing its largest melt in recorded history: 200 billion tons of ice liquified into the ocean.
When glacial ice melts, caving icebergs release sediments and particles into the seawater, initiating our ocean's food chain.
Plankton feed on the sediment, krill eat plankton, and the humpback whales feed on the krill.
This photograph is the result of witnessing with my camera a 36-hour feast by humpback whales.
We assume that the greatest threat of glacial melt will be sea level rise, which will certainly have major impacts on coastlines and populations around the world.
But within this image, we discover that perhaps the greatest threat from glacial melt might be our ocean's ability to feed itself.
Without ice, the ocean food chain may break.
Creating this photograph opened my consciousness.
I hope through your willingness to look and see, it may open yours.
John Doerr: Hello, Hal!
Hal Harvey: John, nice to see you.
JD: Nice to see you too.
HH: So John, we've got a big challenge.
We need to get carbon out of the atmosphere.
We need to stop emitting carbon, drive it to zero by 2050. And we need to be halfway there by 2030. Where are we now?
JD: As you know, we're dumping 55 billion tons of carbon pollution in our precious atmosphere every year, as if it's some kind of free and open sewer.
To get halfway to zero by 2030, we're going to have to reduce annual emissions by about 10 percent a year.
And we've never reduced annual emissions in any year in the history of the planet.
So let's break this down.
Seventy-five percent of the emissions come from the 20 largest emitting countries.
And from four sectors of their economy.
The first is grid.
Second, transportation.
The third from the buildings.
And the fourth from industrial activities.
We've got to fix all those, at speed and at scale.
HH: We do.
And matters are in some ways worse than we think and some ways better.
Let me start with the worse.
Climate change is a wicked problem.
And what do I mean by wicked problem?
It means it's a problem that transcends geographic boundaries.
The sources are everywhere, and the impacts are everywhere.
Although obviously some nations have contributed much more than others.
In fact, one of the terrible things about climate change is those who contributed least to it will be hurt the most.
It's a great inequity machine.
So here we have a problem that you cannot solve within the national boundaries of one country, and yet international institutions are notoriously weak.
So that's part of the wicked problem.
The second element of the wicked problem is it transcends normal timescales. We're used to news day by day, or quarterly reports for business enterprises, or an election cycle -- that's about the longest we think anymore of.
Climate change essentially lasts forever.
When you put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it's there, or its impacts are there, for 1,000 years.
It's a gift we keep on giving for our children, our grandchildren and dozens and dozens of generations beyond there.
JD: It sounds like a tax we keep on paying.
HH: Yeah, it is.
It is.
You sin once, you pay forever.
And then the third element of it being a wicked problem is that carbon dioxide is embedded in every aspect of our industrial economy.
Every car, and every truck, and every airplane, and every house, and every electrical socket, and every industrial processes now emits carbon dioxide.
JD: So what's the recipe?
HH: Well, here's the shortcut.
If you decarbonize the grid, the electrical grid, and then run everything on electricity -- decarbonize the grid and electrify everything -- if you do those two things, you have a zero carbon economy.
Now, that would seem like a pipe dream just a few years ago because it was expensive to create a zero-carbon grid.
But the prices of solar and wind have plummeted.
Solar's now the cheapest form of electricity on planet earth and wind is second.
It means now that you can convert the grid to zero-carbon rapidly and save consumers money along the way.
So there's leverage.
JD: Well, I think a key question, Hal, is do we have the technology that we need to replace fossil fuels to get this job done?
And my answer is no.
I think we're about 70, maybe 80 percent of the way there.
For example, we urgently need a breakthrough in batteries.
Our batteries need to be higher energy density.
They need to have enhanced safety, faster charging.
They need to take less space and less weight, and above all else, they need to cost a lot less.
In fact, we need new chemistries that don't rely on scarce cobalt.
And we're going to need lots of these batteries.
We desperately need much more research in clean energy technology.
The US invests about 2.5 billion dollars a year.
Do you know how much Americans spend on potato chips?
HH: No.
JD: The answer is 4 billion dollars.
Now, what do you think of that?
HH: Upside down.
But let me press a little further on a question that's fascinated me about the Silicon Valley.
So the Silicon Valley is governed by Moore's law, where performance doubles every 18 months.
It's not really a law, it's an observation, but be that as it may.
The energy world is governed by much more mundane laws, the laws of thermodynamics, right?
It's physical stuff in the economy.
Cement, trucks, factories, power plants.
JD: Atoms, not bits.
HH: Atoms, not bits. Perfect. And the transformation of big physical things is slower, and the margins are worse, and often the commodities are generic.
How do we stimulate the kind of innovation in those worlds that we actually need in order to save this planet earth?
JD: Well, that's a really great question.
The innovation starts with basic science in research and development.
And the American commitment to that, while advanced on a global sense, is still paltry.
It needs to be 10 times higher than the, say, 2.5 billion per year that we spend on clean energy R and D. But we need to go beyond R and D as well.
There needs to be a kind of development, a kind of pre-commercialization, which in the US is done by a group called ARPA-E.
Then there's the matter of forming new companies.
HH: Yes.
JD: And I think entrepreneurial energy is shifting back into that field.
It's clear that it takes longer and more capital, but you can build a really substantial and valuable enterprise or company.
HH: Yes.
JD: Tesla's a prime example.
Beyond Meat is another one.
And that's inspiring entrepreneurs globally.
But that's not enough.
I think you need also a demand signal, in the form of policies and purchases, from nations, like Germany did with solar, to go make these markets happen.
And so I'm, at heart, a capitalist.
I think this energy crisis is the mother of all markets.
And it will take longer.
But the market for electric vehicle batteries -- 500 billion dollars a year.
It's probably another 500 billion dollars if you go to stationary batteries.
I want to tell you another story that involves policy, but importantly, plans.
Now, Shenzhen is a city of 15 million people, an innovative city, in China.
And they decided that they were going to move to electric buses.
And so they required all buses be electric.
In fact, they required parking spots have chargers associated with them.
So today, Shenzhen has 18,000 electric buses.
It has 21,000 electric taxis.
And this goodness didn't just happen.
It was the result of a thoughtful, written, five-year plan that isn't just a kind of campaign promise.
Executing against these plans is how mayors get promoted, or fired.
And so it's really deadly serious.
It has to do with carbon, and it has to do with health, with jobs, and with overall economic strength.
The bottom line is that China today has 420,000 electric buses.
America has less than 1,000. So what other national projects are there that you'd like to see?
HH: So this is a global effort, but not everybody's going to do the same thing, or should do the same thing.
Let me start with Norway.
A country that happens to be brilliant at offshore oil, but also understands the consequences of burning more oil.
They realized they could deploy their skills from their offshore oil development into offshore wind.
It's a big deal to put wind turbines out in the ocean.
The ocean, the winds are much stronger, and the winds are much more constant, not only stronger.
So it balances the grid beautifully.
But it's really hard to build things in the deep ocean.
Norway's good at it.
So let them take that on.
JD: Are they taking it on?
HH: They are actually. Yeah. It's pretty brilliant.
Another example: India.
There are hundreds of millions of people in India that don’t have access to electricity.
With the advances in solar and advances in batteries, there's no reason they have to build the grid to all those villages that don't have a grid.
Skip the steps.
Skip the dirty steps.
Leapfrog to clean.
But this all comes together, in my opinion, in the realm of policy.
We need dramatic accelerants, is what you're saying.
Accelerants in R and D, but also accelerants in deployment.
Deployment is innovation because deployment drives prices down.
The right policy can turn things around, and we've seen it happen already in the electricity sector.
So electricity regulators have asked for ever cleaner sources of electricity: more renewables, less coal, less natural gas.
But it's not enough.
So the German government recognized the possibility of driving down the price of clean energy.
And so they put in orders on the books.
They agreed to pay an extra price for early phases of solar energy, presuming the price would drop.
They created the demand signal using policy.
The Chinese created a supply signal, also using policy.
They decided that solar was a strategic part of their future economy.
So you had this unwritten agreement between the two countries, one buying a lot, the other producing a lot, that helped drive the price down 80 percent.
We should be doing that with 10 technologies, or a dozen, around the world.
We need policy as the magic sauce to go through those four sectors in the biggest countries, in all countries.
And one of the things that animates me is that this requires people who are concerned about climate change, which should be everybody, those folks have to apply their energies on the policies that matter with the decision-makers who matter.
If you don't know who the decision-maker is to decarbonize the grid, or to produce electric vehicles in the policy world, you're really not in the game.
JD: Hal, you're an expert in policy.
I know this because I've read your book -- HH: Thanks, John.
JD: Designing Climate Solutions.
What makes for good policy?
HH: There are some secrets here, and they're really important if we want to solve climate change.
Let me give you two of the secrets.
First, you have to go where the tons are.
JD: Follow the tons.
HH: Follow the tons.
And this is such an obvious idea, but it's amazing how many policies tinker around the edges.
I call it green paint.
We don't need green paint.
We need green substance.
The second thing is when you set a policy, insist on continuous improvement.
So what does that mean?
Back in 1978, Jerry Brown was the youngest governor in California's history, and he implemented a thermal building code, which means when you build a building, it has to have insulation in it.
Pretty simple idea.
But he put a trick into that law.
He said every three years, the code gets tighter, and tighter, and tighter.
And how do you know how much tighter?
Anything that pays for itself in energy savings gets thrown into the code.
So in the intervening years, we got better insulation, better windows, better furnaces, better roofing.
Today, a new California building uses 80 percent less energy than a pre-code building.
And Jerry Brown used his legislative bandwidth once to draft that policy that produces fruits forever.
JD: He got the words right.
HH: He got the words right.
Continuous improvement.
There's a counterexample, which should be instructive as well.
So you and I are both of an age where we remember the first oil embargo and the energy crisis that caused with stagnation and inflation at the same time.
Gerald Ford was president.
And he realized that if we could double the fuel efficiency of new vehicles, we could cut in half their energy use.
So he signed a law to double the fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in America, from 13 miles per gallon, absolutely pathetic, to 26 miles per gallon.
JD: That's big.
HH: It’s pathetic by today’s standards, but it was a big deal then, right?
It was doubling.
But by setting a number as the goal, we created a 25-year plateau.
So imagine if instead he said fuel efficiency will increase at four percent a year forever.
JD: So Hal, goals are great things.
How do you find the policymakers that set these goals?
And then how do you influence them?
HH: Well, so that's maybe the most important question of all.
If we have a lot of concern about climate change, and not it's properly aimed, it just dissipates.
It's a one-day headline about a march.
And that's not going to get the job done.
They're the ones that get to decide whether we get cleaner and cleaner energy, more and more efficient buildings, more and more efficient cars, and so forth.
These commissions typically have five members.
So that’s about 250 people in America who control the future of our grid.
HH: You're now down to 150 individuals.
They have a quasi-judicial process.
Because they're uneconomic.
We analyzed every coal plant in America, the economics of every one, and 75 percent of them, it's cheaper to shut them down and replace them with a brand new wind or solar farm than just pay the operating costs of that coal plant.
This is an important question.
I think natural gas is next.
JD: Well, one exciting development comes from my friend and hero Al Gore, who has the vision and is working with entrepreneurs, that by integrating data can produce, for every place on the planet, a new real-time estimate of what their carbon emissions are.
You know, I come from the school of measuring what matters.
HH: Yes you do.
JD: If we had a real-time kind of Google Earth, where we could zoom in to individual factories, or oil fields, or Walmart stores, I think that could really change the game.
I'm also a believer in carbon accounting.
And so I've seen entrepreneurs who are making systems that will allow not just the owners but all the employees of an enterprise or organization to see what's in their carbon supply chain.
HH: Yup. Yup. JD: I'd love to see legislation that required the OMB score every piece of legislation for its carbon impact.
HH: Yes.
JD: If we're serious about this, we're going to measure what matters, measure what really matters.
HH: Yup. Yup. JD: So let's talk about Paris and the Paris Accord because some people say that some nations are ahead of their plans, but others are not, and that the agenda is not aggressive enough.
It’s not going to get us where we need to go.
What is your view of the Paris Accords?
HH: The Paris Accords are quite interesting animals.
It’s not a national commitment and it’s not an international commitment.
JD: They're not binding.
HH: They're not binding.
They're individually determined national contributions.
That’s the term of art that they use in the Paris Accord.
JD: So what does that mean?
HH: So that means Europe says: We're going to do 40 percent less carbon in 2030 than we did in 1990, for example.
If they fail to hit that number, there’s no consequences.
If they go past that number, there’s no consequences.
That, however, does that mean the Paris Accords are not important.
They're really important.
Because they set up, I would call it, a race to the top instead of a race to the bottom.
They set up a dynamic where people were sort of bidding to do better and better.
They created transparency in how people are doing in terms of their carbon emissions.
And there are some countries that take these commitments very seriously, and including the European Union and China on that list.
JD: So I'm going to push on this, and what we really need HH: Yup.
is we need a plan.
HH: So elaborate.
JD: Well, I think what we have today are goals, not a plan.
And I think a plan would be a set of 20 focused precision policy efforts, each of whom's targeted at the right decision-maker or makers, in the right venues, for these 20 largest nations, in the four sectors of their economy.
And these precision campaigns would be well-funded, they'd be well-focused, they'd have an awesome founder/CEO/leader, an amazing staff of people, an accountable set of objectives and key results, and be on a timeline.
We would measure their progress, quarter by quarter.
That would give me hope that we'll get where we need to go by 2030. How about you?
And that is you need to have a deep understanding of who the decision-maker is, ideally by person, certainly by position, and understand exactly what motivates them or hinders them in making this decision so that you can put all your forces on the decision-maker at point of decision.
It's one thing to have a general concern about the environment or about climate.
It's quite another to focus that concern on the most important decisions on the planet.
I love this idea.
JD: Okay, so focus on the decision-makers.
I think there's other individual action that we can and must take.
We've got to amplify your voice so that you organize, activate, proselytize, your company, your neighbors, youth, I think are an incredibly powerful voice, and friends.
HH: Yup.
JD: You need to vote.
What's the takeaway?
HH: I'm an optimist, John.
I've seen this possible.
I've seen when nations decide to do great things, they can do great things.
Think of America’s rural electrification or the interstate highway system we built.
Those are huge projects that transformed the country.
What we did prepping for World War II: we built 300,000 airplanes in four years.
So if we decide to do something, or when the Germans or the Chinese or the Indians decide to do something, other countries, they can get it done.
But if this is sort of piffling around the edges, we won't get there.
What do you think?
Are you optimistic?
JD: My take on this is, I may not be optimistic, but I'm hopeful.
I really think the crucial question is: Can we do what we must, at speed and at scale?
The bad news is, we are fast running out of time.
Any reality we are given is not set in stone, it can be changed.
I come from Costa Rica, a country known for our deep commitment to peace, our high level of education and our far-sighted stewardship of nature.
But it wasn't always like that.
My father could have been indifferent, but he chose to do what was necessary to restore democracy, surviving the burning of his home and his farm.
From here, he launched a revolutionary army of a few courageous men and women, who against all odds, defeated the government forces.
Then he disbanded his army, outlawed the national army, and redirected the military budget to establish the basis of the unique country Costa Rica is today.
From my father, I learned stubborn optimism, the mindset that is necessary to transform the reality we're given into the reality we want.
Today, at the global level, we face a rapidly accelerating climate emergency, daunting because we have procrastinated way too long.
We now have one last chance to truly change our course.
This is the decisive decade in the history of humankind.
That may sound like an exaggeration, but it's not.
If we continue on the current path, we condemn our children and their descendants to a world that is increasingly uninhabitable, with exponentially growing levels of disease, famine, and conflict, and irreversible ecosystem failures.
Our world will be safer and healthier, more stable and more just than what we have now.
This decade is a moment of choice unlike any we have ever lived.
All of us alive right now share that responsibility and that opportunity.
There are many changes to make over the next 10 years, and each of us will take different steps along the way.
But all of us start the transformation in one place, our mindset.
Faced with today's facts, we can be indifferent, do nothing and hope the problem goes away.
We can despair and plunge into paralysis, or we can become stubborn optimists with a fierce conviction that no matter how difficult, we must and we can rise to the challenge.
Optimism is not about blindly ignoring the realities that surround us, that's foolishness.
It's also not a naive faith that everything will take care of itself, even if we do nothing.
That is irresponsibility.
The optimism I'm speaking of is not the result of an achievement, it is the necessary input to meeting a challenge.
It is, in fact, the only way to increase our chance of success.
What we started in utter gloom when I assumed leadership of the international climate change negotiations in 2010, six months after the failed Copenhagen meetings, the world was in a very dark place on climate change.
No one believed we would ever agree on global decarbonization.
Not even I believed it was possible. But then I realized, a shared vision and a globally agreed route toward that vision was indispensable.
It took a deliberate change of mindset, first in me, and then in all other participants, who gradually but courageously moved from despair to determination, from confrontation to collaboration, until we collectively delivered the global agreement.
I say, we don't have the right to give up or let up.
Optimism opens the field of possibility, it drives your desire to contribute, to make a difference, it makes you jump out of bed in the morning because you feel challenged and hopeful at the same time.
It has to be gritty, determined, relentless.
Like our fathers and mothers before us, we are the farmers of the future.
I invite each of you to ask yourself: What is the future you want, and what are you doing to make that future a reality?
You will each have a different answer, but you can all start by joining the growing family of stubborn optimists around the world.
Welcome to the family.Any reality we are given is not set in stone, it can be changed.
I come from Costa Rica, a country known for our deep commitment to peace, our high level of education and our far-sighted stewardship of nature.
But it wasn't always like that.
Way back in the '40s, my father, José Figueres Ferrer, was a young farmer, tilling the soil of these mountains, and cultivating his vision of a country grounded in social justice and guided by the rule of law.
His vision was tested, when in 1948, the government refused to accept the result of democratic elections and brought in the military.
My father could have been indifferent, but he chose to do what was necessary to restore democracy, surviving the burning of his home and his farm.
From here, he launched a revolutionary army of a few courageous men and women, who against all odds, defeated the government forces.
Then he disbanded his army, outlawed the national army, and redirected the military budget to establish the basis of the unique country Costa Rica is today.

The optimism I'm speaking of is not the result of an achievement, it is the necessary input to meeting a challenge.
It is, in fact, the only way to increase our chance of success.
Think of the impact of a positive mindset on a personal goal you have set yourself. Running a marathon, learning a new language, creating a new country, like my father, or like me, reaching a global agreement on climate change.
The Paris Agreement of 2015 is hailed as a historical breakthrough.
What we started in utter gloom when I assumed leadership of the international climate change negotiations in 2010, six months after the failed Copenhagen meetings, the world was in a very dark place on climate change.
No one believed we would ever agree on global decarbonization.
Not even I believed it was possible. But then I realized, a shared vision and a globally agreed route toward that vision was indispensable.
It took a deliberate change of mindset, first in me, and then in all other participants, who gradually but courageously moved from despair to determination, from confrontation to collaboration, until we collectively delivered the global agreement.
But we have not moved fast enough.
Many now believe it is impossible to cut global emissions in half in this decade.
I say, we don't have the right to give up or let up.
Optimism means envisioning our desired future and then actively pulling it closer.
Optimism opens the field of possibility, it drives your desire to contribute, to make a difference, it makes you jump out of bed in the morning because you feel challenged and hopeful at the same time.
But it isn't going to be easy.
We will stumble along the way.
Many other global urgencies could temper our hope for rapid progress, and our current geopolitical reality could easily dampen our optimism.
That's where stubbornness comes in.
Our optimism cannot be a sunny day attitude.
It has to be gritty, determined, relentless.
It is a choice we have to make every single day.
Every barrier must be an indication to try a different way.
In radical collaboration with each other, we can do this.
For years, I had a recurring nightmare in which I saw seven pairs of children's eyes, the eyes of seven generations, staring back at me, asking, "What did you do?
" Now, we have millions of children in the streets, asking us adults the same question, "What are you doing?
" And we have to respond.
Like our fathers and mothers before us, we are the farmers of the future.
I invite each of you to ask yourself: What is the future you want, and what are you doing to make that future a reality?
You will each have a different answer, but you can all start by joining the growing family of stubborn optimists around the world.
Welcome to the family.
So the gods sent a message to an old king. "We will disguise you so that you can enter the enemy camp, find your son's killer and then you can try and ransom your dead son's body back off him.
" When the king tells his queen, she is terrified.
"Don't go!
Man-slaying Achilles will kill you too.
" Doesn't the old man know that the bodies of the dead are worthless?
His quest pointless.
Who would risk their life for a corpse?
The story comes from Book 24 of "The Iliad," a foundation work of Western civilization written by Homer in 700 BC about a war that took place in 1300 BC.
The siege of Troy.
One?
Or two?
Or none?
Will your corpse count make it to the fingers of your left hand?
And how could that be, in a world where everyone is mortal?
The terminally ill are often ashamed of their sickening and hide from sight.We are embarrassed about what to say to a colleague who's lost someone they love. Embarrassed by our mortality. Worried that if we say anything, we will make them more sad. And sad, of course, is bad.
Taking lessons off an instructor.
Going on little laps around your local neighborhood, sitting a whole series of tests, which even if you failed, you'd get to resit again. A common social experience, a rite of passage. It doesn't sound hard, does it?
Like, "That's just a shell, forget about it," you know? The being that you loved in life never existed outside that body and if you loved that person in life, how should you not revere and respect their body in death?
The Romans, the Kelts, the Greeks revered their dead. Like a newborn child, the dead were never to be left alone, and always had someone to watch over them until they were laid to rest. Sad was good too. There was no shame in sorrow at the gates of Troy.

And in the next 200 years, we expect all our glaciers to follow the same path.
We need to start connecting to the future in an intimate and urgent way.
But I asked my grandmother, "Are 100 years a long time or short time?
Thank you.Hi, my name is Andri Snær Magnason, talking from Iceland.
And I'm quite sure that we want them to look at our time with pride and gratitude, because we knew what was happening and we know what needs to be done, and we actually, eventually, did the right thing.
Well, that gap, that 10x gap, is partially because for many years, decades in fact, Black Americans were left off of that ladder and didn't really have access to it.
Well, why are we talking about this now?
I guess the question that I'd been asking myself is, how do we make sure that in this moment, this results in action and progress that starts to close that wealth gap for Black versus white Americans?
So who am I?
My name is Kedra Newsom Reeves.
I am a consultant for banking institutions, hedge funds, asset managers.
But before any of that, I am a Black American who is the descendant of slaves. And when we talk about the wealth gap, it's really important to understand the history, so I thought I'd tell a little story about a family, my family, and how policy intersects with wealth.
So we'll start with my great-great-grandfather.
He was a man named Silas Newsom, and Silas was born a slave outside Nashville, Tennessee, on Newsom Station, where he and his family worked on a quarry.
He didn't own anything.
He didn't own his home. He didn't own property.
He didn't really even own his own body, his own labor, his children.
Any of those things, all of those things, were here to create wealth for someone else.
So we believe that he was a servant during the Civil War for a Confederate general who was actually fighting to keep him enslaved, so he really had no wealth, he had no control over his life.
Well, at the end of slavery, there was a policy opportunity.
There was a question: what do we do for the hundreds of years of slavery now that we are ending slavery and the country is coming together?
And there was a choice.
We could make a settlement with the slaves, or we could make a settlement with the slave owners.
Well, the slaves had no power to advocate for themselves in that moment, and the country had to be united, so the federal government decided to give that settlement to slave owners, essentially giving them money for the property that they had lost at the end of the war.
And not their physical property, not their homes, but people, the slaves that had provided free labor for years and decades. So Silas, at the end of the Civil War, had no wealth.
He was free but had no wealth. He became a sharecropper.
My great-grandfather Silas was born a number of years after the end of slavery, and he was drafted to serve in World War I along with 350,000 other Black American soldiers in segregated units.
He served in the war.
When he came back to the United States, at the end of the war, there was very anti-Black sentiment.
The economy was compressing, there were a lot of stressors, and Black people could not get land, they could not get loans for homes, they really could not acquire any credit to build wealth over time, so he also became a farmer.
And he had a son, also named Silas -- there are a lot of Silases in my family -- my grandfather.
My grandfather Silas was also a soldier and fought in World War II.
After World War II, the US Federal Government passed the GI Bill, which provided support for veterans.
And the bill provided for building of hospitals, student loans and, most importantly for wealth-building, low-interest home mortgages for veterans.
In the years following the war, the GI Bill accounted for four billion dollars of funding to nine million veterans.
But Black veterans largely did not benefit.
So Silas, my grandfather, came back to Nashville, Tennessee, and he married my grandmother, whose name is Cinderella.
Yes, my grandmother's name was Cinderella.
And they had eight children.
But they never bought a home.
And the highlight of their housing journey was moving into a new public housing project with their children and paying rent for that housing project, which in terms of the quality of housing was fantastic for them and a step up, but did not allow them to build wealth.
My father, another soldier, a 20-year veteran of the United States Marines, bought his first home in his early 50s, but it took four generations for our family to move into homeownership and begin to build ownership and equity in a home.
There's a lot of history there, but that story tells you a bit about how we get to this 10x gap where we are today.
Now, certainly, as we think about the size of that gap, it is critical for the Federal Government to take a number of actions.
That said, financial institutions play a really important role in providing access to credit, access to capital, to build communities and allow Black communities to thrive.
We have to be clear; managing 17,000 dollars better does not get us there.
Better education does not get us there.
Access to credit and capital are critical.
So I want to talk about four solutions today that financial institutions can contribute to start to close the wealth gap.
Number one is getting more people on the ladder, getting more people banked.
We know today that about half of Black Americans are un- or underbanked.
Unbanked means that you don't have a banking account. Underbanked means that you have a bank account but you use alternative services for check-cashing or payday lending or paying bills.
And that's not just expensive from a transaction perspective in terms of the fees that you pay, it's also expensive in terms of the time that you commit to paying a bill.
Think about how you pay your utility bill today.
It probably comes out of your checking account.
You don't even think about it.
You set it up in advance, and it's automatic.
About 40 percent of people who are unbanked say they are unbanked because they think they don't have the minimum amount to really maintain a checking account.
Lastly, we've got to talk about business, and not just small businesses.
Take all of the new tech companies, and I say "new" because now they're not so new, but take Facebook, Google, Amazon.
At some point, all of those companies were sole proprietorships with one employee or a few employees that were building a technology that was not yet proven.
Those are just four solutions.
This gap is not new.
It's important to our families, it's important to our communities and it's important to our economy.
He was a man named Silas Newsom, and Silas was born a slave outside Nashville, Tennessee, on Newsom Station, where he and his family worked on a quarry.
He didn't own anything.
He didn't own his home. He didn't own property.
Well, at the end of slavery, there was a policy opportunity.
There was a question: what do we do for the hundreds of years of slavery now that we are ending slavery and the country is coming together?
And there was a choice.
We could make a settlement with the slaves, or we could make a settlement with the slave owners.

And not their physical property, not their homes, but people, the slaves that had provided free labor for years and decades. So Silas, at the end of the Civil War, had no wealth.
He was free but had no wealth. He became a sharecropper.

Yes, my grandmother's name was Cinderella.
And they had eight children.
But they never bought a home.
And the highlight of their housing journey was moving into a new public housing project with their children and paying rent for that housing project, which in terms of the quality of housing was fantastic for them and a step up, but did not allow them to build wealth.
My father, another soldier, a 20-year veteran of the United States Marines, bought his first home in his early 50s, but it took four generations for our family to move into homeownership and begin to build ownership and equity in a home.
There's a lot of history there, but that story tells you a bit about how we get to this 10x gap where we are today.
Now, certainly, as we think about the size of that gap, it is critical for the Federal Government to take a number of actions.
That said, financial institutions play a really important role in providing access to credit, access to capital, to build communities and allow Black communities to thrive.
We have to be clear; managing 17,000 dollars better does not get us there.
Better education does not get us there.
Access to credit and capital are critical.
So I want to talk about four solutions today that financial institutions can contribute to start to close the wealth gap.
Number one is getting more people on the ladder, getting more people banked.
We know today that about half of Black Americans are un- or underbanked.
Unbanked means that you don't have a banking account. Underbanked means that you have a bank account but you use alternative services for check-cashing or payday lending or paying bills.
And that's not just expensive from a transaction perspective in terms of the fees that you pay, it's also expensive in terms of the time that you commit to paying a bill.
Think about how you pay your utility bill today.
It probably comes out of your checking account.
You don't even think about it.
You set it up in advance, and it's automatic.
Well, if you're unbanked, you are probably going to get a money order somewhere, physically, a piece of paper. You then travel to City Hall or your DMV to pay that bill.
About 40 percent of people who are unbanked say they are unbanked because they think they don't have the minimum amount to really maintain a checking account.
Well, that's just not true.
In the last several years, credit unions, community banks and major banking institutions have created low-cost, no-minimum checking and savings account products specifically made for this population.
So we have an issue with awareness.
Banks, community partners and others have to work together to increase the awareness of these products in communities that need them, so that we can start to reduce the number of people who are un- and underbanked and get them on the ladder that we talked about earlier.
What we need to see is, from the Federal Government and the banking industry, to come together to create innovation sandboxes to start to use alternative data to expand to marginalized groups.
Well, what about communities?
Without community wealth, individual wealth, in a way, is on an island.
And if you go into most major cities in the United States to most communities of color, what you'll find is underinvested communities.
For every economic crisis, these communities have suffered severely.
For every economic boom, they have not benefited.
Lastly, we've got to talk about business, and not just small businesses.
Now, when you have individual stability and a banking institution, and you have access to credit, and when you have community wealth, those are all fantastic things, but we need also job creation.
What those companies received early on was venture capital money.
And when you look at venture capital today, only one percent of venture capital funds go to Black founders.
Financial institutions play a really critical role at the individual level, at the community level and at the business level.
This movement is still fragmented and as yet has no name.
They can be found at work in Japan's visionary Future Design movement, which aims to overcome the short-term cycles that dominate politics by drawing on the principle of seventh generation decision making practiced by many Native Americans communities.
The other half are given ceremonial robes to wear and told to imagine themselves as residents from the year 2060. Well, it turns out that the residents from 2060 systematically advocate far more transformative city plans, from healthcare investments to climate change action.
And this innovative form of future citizens assembly is now spreading throughout Japan from small towns like Yahaba to major cities like Kyoto.
What if Future Design was adopted by towns and cities worldwide to revitalize democratic decision making and extend their vision far beyond the now?
Now, time rebels have also taken to courts of law to secure the rights of future people.
The organization Our Children's Trust has filed a landmark case against the US Government on behalf of 21 young people campaigning for the legal right to a safe climate and healthy atmosphere for both current and future generations.
Their David versus Goliath struggle has already inspired groundbreaking lawsuits worldwide from Colombia and Pakistan to Uganda and the Netherlands.
And this wave of activism is growing alongside the movement to grant legal personhood to nature, from the Whanganui River in Aotearoa, New Zealand to the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers in India.
Time rebels are taking action at the ballot box too.
In 2019, teenagers across Europe began lobbying their parents and grandparents to give them their votes in the European parliamentary elections of that year.
The hashtag #givethekidsyourvote went viral on social media and was spread by climate campaigners as far as Australia.
My partner and I heard about it and decided to give our votes in the last UK general election to our 11-year-old twins.
So we all sat around the kitchen table and debated the party manifestos, and they then each told us where to put the X on the ballot sheet.
And in case you're wondering, no, they didn't simply mirror their parents' political opinions.
So the time rebellion has begun.
The rebels are rising to decolonize the future founding a global movement for long-term thinking and intergenerational justice that may turn out to be one of the most powerful political movements of this century.
They're helping us escape the short-term cycles that digital distraction and consumer culture trap us in, with the lure of the Buy Now button and 24/7 news.
They inspire us to extend our time horizons from seconds and minutes to decades and far beyond.
The artist Katie Paterson's project, Future Library, will be a century in the making.
But how can we really think and plan on the scale of millennia?
Well, the answer is perhaps the ultimate secret to being a time rebel, and it comes from the biomimicry designer Janine Benyus, who suggests we learn from nature's 3.8 billion years of evolution.
How is it that other species have learned to survive and thrive for 10,000 generations or more?
So a profound starting point for time rebels everywhere is to focus not simply on lengthening time but on regenerating place.
We must restore and repair and care for the planetary home that will take care of our offspring.
For our children, and our children's children, and all those yet to come, we must fall in love with rivers and mountains, with ice sheets and savannas, and reconnect with the long and life-giving cycles of nature.
Let us all become time rebels and be inspired by the beautiful Mohawk blessing spoken when a child is born: "Thank you, Earth.
You know the way.It's time for humankind to recognize a disturbing truth: we have colonized the future.
In wealthy countries, especially, we treat it like a distant colonial outpost where we can freely dump ecological damage and technological risk as if there was nobody there.
The tragedy is that tomorrow's generations aren't here to challenge this pillaging of their inheritance.
They can't leap in front of the king's horse like a suffragette or stage a sit-in like a civil rights activist or go on a Salt March to defy their colonial oppressors like Mahatma Gandhi.
They're granted no political rights or representation; they have no influence in the marketplace.
The great silent majority of future generations is rendered powerless.
It could be hard to grasp the scale of this injustice, so look at it this way: There are 7.7 billion people alive today.
That's just a tiny fraction of the estimated 100 billion people who have lived and died over the past 50,000 years.
But both of these are vastly outnumbered by the nearly seven trillion people who will be born over the next 50,000 years, assuming current birth rates stabilize.
In the next two centuries alone, tens of billions of people will be born, amongst them, all your grandchildren, and their grandchildren and the friends and communities on whom they'll depend.
How will all these future generations look back on us and the legacy we're leaving for them?
We've clearly inherited extraordinary legacies from our common ancestors: the gift of the agricultural revolution, medical discoveries and the cities we still live in.
But we've certainly inherited destructive legacies too.
Well, over the past decade, a global movement has started to emerge of people committed to decolonizing the future and extending our time horizons towards a longer now.
I think of its pioneers as time rebels.
Future Design gathers together residents to draw up and discuss plans for the towns and cities where they live.
What if Future Design was adopted by towns and cities worldwide to revitalize democratic decision making and extend their vision far beyond the now?

How is it that other species have learned to survive and thrive for 10,000 generations or more?
If you go to the store in search of milk, there are a dizzying number of products to choose from.
There’s dairy milk, but also plant-based products.
To turn a plant into something resembling milk, it must be either soaked, drained, rinsed, and milled into a thick paste, or dried, and milled into flour.
The plant paste or flour is then fortified with vitamins and minerals, flavoured, and diluted with water.
The result is a barrage of options that share many of the qualities of animal milk.
So which milk is actually best for you?
Let’s dive into some of the most popular milks: dairy, almond, soy, or oat?
A 250 ml glass of cow’s milk contains 8 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, and 2 to 8 grams of fat depending on if it’s skim, reduced fat, or whole.
That’s approximately 15% the daily protein an average adult needs, roughly 10% the carbohydrates and 2 to 15% the fat.
Most plant-based milks have less carbohydrates than dairy milk.
They also have less fat, but more of what’s often called “good fats.
” Meanwhile, the healthy nutrients vitamin D and calcium found in dairy milk don’t occur naturally in most plant-based milks.
Looking more closely at our plant-based milks, both almond and oat are low in protein compared to dairy.
But while almond milk has the least nutrients of the four, oat milk is full of beta-glucans, a healthy type of fibre.
It also has a lot of carbohydrates compared to other plant milks— sometimes as much as dairy milk.
Soy milk, meanwhile, has as much protein as cow’s milk and is also a great source of potassium.
Soybeans contain isoflavone, which people used to think might trigger hormonal imbalances by mimicking the function of estrogen.
But ultimately, soy milk contains very small amounts of isoflavones, which have a much weaker effect on our bodies than estrogen.
Depending on individual circumstances, one of these milks may be the clear winner: if you’re lactose intolerant, then the plant-based milks pull ahead, while if you’re allergic to nuts, almond milk is out.
For people who don’t have access to a wide and varied diet, dairy milk can be the most efficient way to get these nutrients.
But all else being equal, any one of these four milks is nutritious enough to be part of a balanced diet.
That’s why for many people, the milk that’s best for you is actually the milk that’s best for the planet.
So which uses the fewest resources and produces the least pollution?
It takes almost 4 square kilometers to produce just one glass of cow’s milk, land use that drives deforestation and habitat destruction.
Most of that is land the cows live on, and some is used to grow their feed.
Many cows eat soy beans and oats.
It takes much less land to grow the oats or soybeans for milk than it does to feed a dairy cow— only about a quarter square kilometer per glass.
Almond milk has similar land use. But where that land is also matters— soybean farms are a major driver of deforestation, while oat and almond farms aren’t.
Making milk uses water every step of the way, but it’s the farming stage where big differences emerge.
Most of that water is used to grow almond trees, which take years of watering before they start producing almonds.
The trees must be watered consistently, or they die, while many other crops can be left fallow and still produce later.
All told, soy and oats require less water to grow: only about 5 to 10 liters per glass of milk.
Milk production generates some greenhouse gas emissions— about 0.1 to 0.2 kilograms per glass for the plant-based milks.
But for dairy milk, the cows themselves also produce emissions by burping and farting out large quantities of the gas methane.
Overall, each glass of dairy milk contributes over half a kilogram of greenhouse gas emissions.

So while depending on your dietary needs, any one of these milks may be a good fit, in terms of the health of our planet there’s a strong case for choosing plant-based milks, particularly oat or soy milk.
Liz Ogbu: So Lisa, Apple is on target to become carbon neutral across its entire business and manufacturing supply chain by 2030. Can you explain exactly what that means?
Lisa Jackson: Sure.
So today Apple is carbon neutral for all of our own operations.
And we're running on 100 percent renewable energy for our corporate campuses, for our stores and for our data centers.
So we know how to do this work.
The challenge for 2030 is to convert our supply chain, and that work has already begun.
We already have 70 suppliers, over eight gigawatts of energy coming online in our supply chain, and then our last piece will be to convert the energy that our customers use to charge our devices to clean energy.
LO: What are some of the biggest changes that Apple's going to need to make in its business operations in order to be able to achieve those goals?
LJ: So imagine if instead of mining material to go into Apple products, we actually started with recycled material.
So we're not going all the way back to the mine through smelting, transportation, processing.
Instead, we're really talking about reprocessing to some degree and putting that material right back into products -- super important with things like conflict metals or rare earths.
So Apple has been doing that work now for several years.
We've actually promised that we want to make all of our products out of recycled and renewable materials.
And so that investment also means we get to take away all the carbon emissions associated with everything up until the point of the recycled material.
LO: So it strikes me that you actually hold a really interesting perspective.
You know, you're now at Apple and, like, deep in the business world around these things, but formerly, you actually led the US Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama administration, so you've seen the government side as well.
What, in your mind, is the right way to look at the respective roles of the state and the market in fighting the climate crisis?
LJ: I don't think there's anything that business can do that replaces the role of government and leadership.
Yes, I ran the EPA, but the other part of my history is I worked there almost 20 years before I became the head of the EPA.
And you see firsthand, right, that only government is really charged with protecting its citizens.
Now, business is a different story. I think business has an incredibly important role to play in leading, especially at this time.
So when Apple said its goal is 2030 carbon neutral -- obviously the UN is saying 2050 carbon neutral -- we decided to challenge ourselves to go as fast as we could possibly do it so that other businesses wouldn't have an excuse to say, "I need longer.
I need much, much longer.
" I think it's great to see this moment where suddenly there seems to be a realization that climate change policy cannot be foisted on others, but that, in fact, it has to be organic, you know, for lack of a better word.
And it's not an either-or.
It's always been this weird, you know, belief that we're taught from little that you can either be successful or you can do the right thing.
There is no climate justice without real justice. There is no climate change remedy that is going to be made and stick that doesn't involve justice.
So thank you.Liz Ogbu: So Lisa, Apple is on target to become carbon neutral across its entire business and manufacturing supply chain by 2030. Can you explain exactly what that means?

And it's not an either-or.
It's always been this weird, you know, belief that we're taught from little that you can either be successful or you can do the right thing.
There's no difference between the two; it's a false choice.
LO: Although a lot of us have been talking about justice for some time, it is only recently that I think this idea of justice as it relates to the environment and climate is making appearance in a forum such as this.
You've personally described systemic racism and climate change as interconnected issues, and I think it would be great to hear more.
LJ: To me, they're just the same thing.
There is no climate justice without real justice. There is no climate change remedy that is going to be made and stick that doesn't involve justice.
And sometimes, more and more, I'm starting to think that we shouldn't attack climate change, we should attack justice and injustice, and if we did, climate change would take care of itself.
For me, it's always come down to restoring people to the center of the discussion of solutions and restoring representation for the communities most impacted by climate change at the table of solution-making.
LO: Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
It's been a real pleasure to speak with you today, and I look forward to seeing how you advanced the efforts you talked about.
LJ: And thank you for the voice you've been.
I think it's super important that leadership look like us, but also sound like you.
So thank you.
Lindsay Levin: So Dave, in just a few months, you transition into a new role as CEO of consumer retail at Amazon.
That's a big role.
How will climate sit as a priority for you, given all the other things you'll have on your plate?
Dave Clark: We've spent much of our end of the summer in smoke-filled Seattle, unable to enjoy the majestic Pacific Northwest due to all the fires that encompassed the West Coast of the US this summer.
Climate is a very real challenge for all of us, not just at Amazon, but in our daily lives at this point.
And I've been focused on this with the team and with Kara for years now.
In fact, we've embedded the sustainability teams inside of our operations team, as opposed to being a separate part of the company, because we wanted those teams connected with the groups that can actually make change.
LL: Kara, can you describe a couple of the biggest hurdles you face as you work to reduce the carbon footprint of a company like Amazon?
And we're committed to reaching net zero emissions.
I think our size and our scale can actually be a tremendous advantage.
It forces us to think about our carbon footprint throughout all of our businesses, our operations, our technologies, our services, our products.
And at one end, we want to power our operations by 100 percent renewable energy by 2025, but we're also making sure that when you receive a shipment, we're at net zero carbon all the way through those operations.
And we want to do this in a very Amazonian way.
So we took a number of years to build what we call "a carbon system of record.
" These are tools that allow us to think about this holistically across the company.
LL: Dave, Amazon has made a pledge, you call it "the Climate Pledge," to be net zero across your business by 2040. That's 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.
Give us a sense of the scale of transformation that that calls for across your operations.
DC: It's very daunting.
When we started this process, we started from a position of science, of digging in and understanding all the inputs of our business, what parts of our business create and put carbon into the environment, what are the elements, each piece of that process, and how do we improve them.
And as we started looking at that, we said, well, how are we going to meet these objectives?
And it really requires innovation across almost every aspect of the business, whether it be in our renewable space, whether it be in electrification of our vehicles, whether it be in our packaging and processes, whether it be working with manufacturers.
Essentially, the entire span of our supply chain is required to modify to meet the objectives of this over time, which is why the Climate Pledge was so important.
LL: Kara, the Climate Pledge is not just about Amazon. You're inviting other companies to join you.
KH: We know with the Climate Pledge we cannot do this alone.
It's going to take companies, but partnership also with governments and communities and individuals who will come up with solutions and new technologies.
We want to engage our full supply chain as well as other companies, and we're really excited that already 11 major organizations have signed on to the Climate Pledge with us.
We want to accelerate innovation, and we've established a two-billion-dollar Climate Pledge Fund to invest in these companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.
So we know this is a very ambitious challenge, but we want to make the greatest impact in the shortest possible timeline, and it's exciting to share the complexity about how we think about this at Amazon with other companies and invite them to come along with us.
LL: Dave, when a company like Amazon moves, it can have a huge impact across supply chains.
Give us an example or two of how a decision that you've made is catalyzing innovation across the sector.
DC: I can tell you, just the example of Rivian.
Rivian is the electric vehicle manufacturer that is going to build 100,000 electric delivery vehicles for our delivery fleet.
When we went out and made this investment, the number of new companies that started to spawn relative to supporting Rivian, to new electric delivery vehicles, to even alternative fuels -- we started getting calls about alternative jet fuel the day we put out that announcement on Rivian.
There was just example after example of those.
LL: Dave, Kara, thank you so much for being with us.
We wish you every success with the Climate Pledge and really can't wait to see the progress you guys are going to make.
DC: Thank you, it's an honor to be here and be part of such an amazing event.
KH: Thank you.
I used to be really bad at earning money.
Early on, I was a junior financial planner, and my job was to help people manage their wealth.
But my salary was so low that I started riding my bike to work to save money on gas, and I started a garden to save money on food.
Now I run a bookkeeping agency that specifically serves creative businesses.
[TED: The Way We Work] [Made possible with the support of Dropbox] This might sound strange coming from a former financial planner, but I'm not a fan of capitalism.
Almost everyone I work with and know and love is an artist, including me.
So I know, the way the system is set up, freelancers and artists are too often way underpaid.
They often feel like focusing on money will corrupt their creativity, or they think they're just not that good at making money anyway.
But the truth is, we can be good at it, and in fact, we have to be, because our freedom is at stake: our freedom to create, to influence and to use the power of money to change the very exploitation that keeps artists broke to begin with.
I'm not struggling anymore, and I've learned a lot since being a financial planner, and I just wanted to share that knowledge.
So here's what I've learned and done.
One: what you do. When it comes to your offer, you have to be able to answer the following question: Why would anyone hire you over your competition?
Two: who you do it for.
After you determine what sets you apart, position yourself for your ideal customer.
In order for this to be effective, you must narrow your focus.
Without focus, you try to be everything for everyone, and you end up being nothing for nobody.
Then, use the kind of language that appeals to your target customer.
Create the kind of marketing materials or the kind of portfolio that attracts them.
Then be in the real-life and virtual places they are.
For example, if you're a videographer and you want to work with mission-driven companies that bring clean water to places where it's scarce, create a video trailer that shows exactly how the power of film moves people to act.
Three: when it's time to talk money, understand the real value that you create.
You're not just being compensated for the time that you work on a project.
You're being compensated for everything you've learned and everything you've done over the years that make you excellent at what you do.
Ask yourself questions like: How does your service impact a customer's bottom line?
How do you create efficiencies that generate cost savings?
How much money can your customer make from a product that you helped them create?
For example, if you're a freelancer that helps YouTube creators develop merch like T-shirts and dad hats, mention how much money you've helped your clients generate.
Or, if you've created a diversity and inclusion training program for corporations, talk about how much time and money a company saves purchasing your product instead of developing their own.
Four: make sure your price includes your taxes, your overhead and your profit.
When you're a freelancer, you are your own business, so you're responsible for marketing, accounting, taxes, legal, insurance, overhead and profit. If you price too low, you've already negotiated against yourself.
Just say that you're running a business and you can't afford to do the work for less.
Because when you earn enough working with clients that value your work, you don't have to compromise by working with clients who don't.
Science tells us we must limit to global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We are on track for three degrees at least.
Climate disruption, due to our outdated addiction to fossil fuels, is causing unprecedented wildfires, more intense and frequent cyclones, floods, droughts, and other weather extremes.
History shows that when we grab such moments, we can succeed.
Science tells us we must limit to global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We are on track for three degrees at least.
No country's immune from the climate crisis.
History shows that when we grab such moments, we can succeed.
But it is still necessary for governments to create the tax and regulatory frameworks that will further stimulate climate action by the private sector.
Also from financial institutions and private investors.
On the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement in December, leaders from government, business, and civil society will gather online to do just that.
The calm, tranquil feeling we all get is not a coincidence.
The problem is clear.
If we could stop the losses of forests around the world, we could directly help to cut our annual emissions.
So we began building a new network.
The more people we contacted, the more data we received, and the more clearly patterns began to emerge.
With data from over 1.2 million forests, we were able to build new machine learning models to predict forest structure around the world.
For the first time, we could see that our earth is home to just over three trillion trees, almost half of what existed before human civilization.
We could see where the different species are distributed and how carbon is stored in this massive system.
But this approach could also show us something more transformative.
Using the same models, we could begin to see where trees might naturally grow under the existing climate.
And this suggested that outside of urban and agricultural areas, there's 0.9 billion hectares where trees would naturally exist.
And this is room for just over one trillion new trees.
We estimated that if we could protect these areas in the long term, then the soils and vegetation might capture up to 30 percent of the excess carbon in the atmosphere, capturing decades of human emissions.
We now have a wealth of ongoing research to refine these initial estimates.
But the scale of this potential suggests that along with all the other benefits these ecosystems provide, they might also represent a valuable role in our fight against climate change.
When our research was accepted to be published in the journal Science, nothing could have prepared us for the media explosion that followed.
Suddenly, it seemed like the whole world was talking about the potential of trees.
Under the umbrella of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the World Economic Forum launched their Trillion Trees Campaign to go alongside similar efforts from the WWF and United Nations.
Suddenly, governments and companies all around the world were pledging their commitment to the restoration of earth's forests.
And with the job creation that would result, the idea of a global restoration movement was becoming a reality.
But in the excitement of it all, and with the chance to make that positive impact I'd always dreamed of, I made some naive and stupid mistakes in communication that threatened the entire message.
The simplicity of our message was its strength, but it came at the expense of nuance that is so important.
And as the headlines began to emerge, I desperately just wanted to pull them back in. Because to some, it seemed like we were proposing restoration as the single solution to climate change.
And this is the opposite of what this movement needs.
When viewed through this lens, restoration just seems like an easy way out, a chance for us to "offset our emissions" by planting a few trees and ignore the very real and urgent challenges of cutting emissions and protecting the ecosystems that we currently have.
Restoration is not a silver bullet.
There is no silver bullet.
It is just one of a huge portfolio of solutions that we so desperately need.
And this view of trees as an easy way out is such a tempting perspective, but it is a real threat to the climate change movement and to the ecosystems that still remain.
(Faint sounds) This is also the sound of trees.
It's a eucalyptus plantation that exists just a couple of miles away from where we began.
Notice how there were no sounds of birds or insects.
The songs of biodiversity are gone.
That's because what you're hearing is not an ecosystem.
It's a monoculture of one single tree species planted for rapid tree growth.
Along with the biodiversity that used to live here, this local community has now lost the benefits those ecosystems provided, like clean water, soil fertility, and most urgently, protection from the intense fires that now threaten the region every summer.
The UN suggests that almost half of reforested areas around the world are monocultures just like this, planted for rapid timber production or carbon capture.
Just like a farm, these plantations may be valuable for timber, but they are not the restoration of nature.
And monocultures are just one of the many ways we can damage ecosystems when we offset our emissions without considering the local ecology or the people that depend on it.
Following these mistakes, a second wave of articles flooded in, warning of the risks of restoration done wrong.
And this criticism was so painful because it was entirely correct.
But most of all, I was terrified that we would squander this incredible opportunity, because restoration has such enormous potential for positive impact.
But just like every good idea, it only works if we get it right.
But as the dust settled, we realized that this was actually a time when the entire movement gained real momentum.
More people than ever were interested in global restoration, and with messages flooding in about the successes and failures of restoration projects around the world, we had access to the lessons that can help us to get it right.
Every new criticism offered incredible opportunities to learn and grow. Every failed restoration example was a lesson on how to improve future projects.
These learnings were an entirely new source of data -- data from the real heroes of this movement, from the people on the ground who were conserving and managing ecosystems around the world.
Historically, these are questions that have been addressed through years of rigorous trial and error.
But we started wondering: What if we fed this deep on-the-ground knowledge back into our machine-learning models to learn from the thousands of successes and failures?
Could this help us to identify which strategies are working and failing around the world?
And about a year ago, we started working with Google to help build and scale this idea into a functioning online ecosystem, where projects from around the world can learn and grow together.
By pairing Google's technology and our models, this ever-growing network of scientists, restoration projects, and NGOs could now build the platform that could serve the restoration movement.
And I am so excited to give you a first glimpse of what we've been working on.
This is Restor, an open data platform for the restoration movement, providing free ecological insights to show which species of trees, grasses, or shrubs might exist in that region, monitoring of projects so that we can all see the developments happening on the ground.
And most importantly, for the sharing of ecological information so that restoration organizations can learn one another and so that funders can find and track projects to support.
Restor is a digital ecosystem for restoration.
The more data the community uploads, the stronger the predictions get and the more informed action we can all take.
Putting the learnings of thousands of projects into the hands of people everywhere.
And this ecosystem is much bigger than just planting trees.
Trees are just the symbol for entire ecosystem restoration.
Restor is for the protection of land so trees can recover, for the amendment of soil so vegetation can return, and for the thousands of other approaches used to promote the health of grasslands, peatlands, and all other ecosystems that are equally important for life on earth.
The word "restore" is defined as the act of returning something back to its original state, but it's also the act of returning it back to its original owners.
The restoration of nature is for the local biodiversity and the communities that depend on it.
And as that network grows, the collective action benefits everyone.
And these benefits go far beyond the threat of climate change.
Even if climate change stopped right now, the protection and rebuilding of earth's biodiversity would still be a top priority because it underpins all life on earth.
It can help us with all other global threats, including extreme weather events, droughts, food shortages and global pandemics.
But global restoration won't be easy, and it will not be solved by tech solutions alone.
Just like the interdependent species that make up natural ecosystems, we humans are deeply dependent on one another.
The scientists, governments, NGOs, businesses, you, me, we are all needed to keep this movement going.
We need the whole ecology of humanity.
We all evolved in ecosystems like this, where the sounds of birds and insects indicated the possibility of food, medicines and all the resources we need for survival.
For most of my career, I focused on just one of those fascinating connections between insects and fungi in the soil.
And this is where forests can help.
And if we could start to tip the balance in the other direction, we might even help the repair process.
But this approach could also show us something more transformative.
Using the same models, we could begin to see where trees might naturally grow under the existing climate.
Restoration is not a silver bullet.
There is no silver bullet.

These tools can inform us, but ultimately the challenge is one that can only be addressed by us, by all of us.
Just like the interdependent species that make up natural ecosystems, we humans are deeply dependent on one another.
We need the immense network of limitless connections, the farmers and project leaders on the ground who need local markets and industries to make use of sustainable products.
The scientists, governments, NGOs, businesses, you, me, we are all needed to keep this movement going.
We need the whole ecology of humanity.
Thank you.

I am here to speak on behalf of the starving children around the world whose cries go unheard.
I'm here to speak for the countless animals dying across this planet because they have nowhere left to go.
(Video) SCS: I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the holes in our ozone.
I'm afraid to breathe the air, because I don't know what chemicals are in it.
I used to go fishing in Vancouver, my home, with my dad, until just a few years ago, we found the fish full of cancers.
SCS: A generation ago, I was that 12-year-old child.
In 1992, I had five minutes to speak to the UN's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
My friends and I had started an environmental club, and we'd traveled to this huge international meeting about environment and development to tell the adults they had to change their ways.
That same year 1,700 scientists would issue the World Scientists' Warning to Humanity to tell us that humans and the natural world were on a collision course.
Much like Greta Thunberg and her peers today, we believed that decision-makers should be acting on science and facts.
And the facts were telling us that we were headed for ecological collapse.
(Video) SCS: All this is happening before our eyes, and yet we act as if we have all the time we want and all the solutions.
SCS: Back then, climate change had been identified, but we had yet to really feel it.
Today, almost 30 years later, climate change is no longer a prediction.
It is here, and it happened far faster than even the experts predicted.
We did not stop it.
Today the work that we must do is about mitigation, trying to limit how bad it gets.
In 2015, in Paris, the world agreed to limit the planet's warming to one and a half degrees Celsius, as beyond that would pose too great a threat to human life.
To meet this, we will have to cut our global emissions by half in the next 10 years.
(Video) SCS: I'm only a child and I don't have all the solutions, but I want you to realize neither do you.
SCS: Young people are always at the frontlines of any revolution.
And it's young people who ask me, "What did your speech actually do?
Why didn't the delegates actually listen?
" Well, looking back, I think that the delegates of the conference actually did listen, not just to me, but to the thousands of voices calling for change.
If you look at the declarations, the documents that came out of Rio, they are radical.
They include the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change set up to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and prevent dangerous interference with the climate system.
Twenty-three years before the Paris Agreement, 154 countries signed this legally binding international agreement.
(Video) SCS: I'm only a child, yet I know we are all in this together and should act as one single world towards one single goal.
SCS: So, why didn't the world take action?
Instead, governments focused on growing the economy, on business interests and of course, winning the next election.
It shows a crisis in human governance, where our political systems make it impossible to act in long-term interests for the people and future generations.
Today it's 2020. Again we have the momentum.
We have the Paris Agreement to limit the Earth's warming.
We have youth and social justice demands.
We have calls for divestment.
We have calls for climate emergencies.
We have the science, we have the solutions and we all are experiencing climate change.
We are at a moment parallel to Rio.
Now is the time to take action.
(Video) SCS: If you don't know how to fix it, please stop breaking it.
SCS: How do we ensure that this time we act on our words?
History has shown us that in moments of crisis, society can truly transform.
We've seen this in times of war, in times of economic collapse and in times of disease.
Today, we live in the time of COVID-19. We've seen governments and institutions across all sectors working quickly, working together.
Humans like to think that we're in control of everything, but we have been reminded today that the laws of nature are the true bottom line.
We've been reminded that science and expertise are crucial to our survival.
COVID-19 has shone a light on inequity and revealed our prejudiced infrastructures.
It is a warning. If we don't listen, if we don't change, next time could be far worse.
(Video) SCS: My dad always says, "You are what you do, not what you say.
" Well, what you do makes me cry at night.
You grown-ups say you love us, but I challenge you, please, make your actions reflect your words.
SCS: That last sentence summarizes my entire speech at Rio.
Please, make your actions reflect your words.
Our generation is determining the lives of our children.
We have 10 years where we can still make a difference.
We have 10 years to cut our emissions by half.
The way to truly love our children is to make our actions reflect our words.
Now it's time to get to work.

History’s first empire rose out of a hot, dry landscape, without rainfall to nourish crops, without trees or stones for building.
In spite of all this, its inhabitants built the world’s first cities, with monumental architecture and large populations— and they built them entirely out of mud.
Sumer occupied the southern part of modern Iraq in the region called Mesopotamia.
Mesopotamia means “between two rivers”— the Tigris and the Euphrates. Around 5000 BCE, early Sumerians used irrigation channels, dams, and reservoirs to redirect river water and farm large areas of previously bone-dry land. Agricultural communities like this were slowly springing up around the world.
But Sumerians were the first to take the next step. Using clay bricks made from river mud, they began to build multi-storied homes and temples.
They invented the wheel— a potter’s wheel, for turning mud into household goods and tools.
Those clay bricks gave rise to the world’s first cities, probably around 4500 BCE.
At the top of the city’s social ladder were priests and priestesses, who were considered nobility, then merchants, craftspeople, farmers, and enslaved people. The Sumerian empire consisted of distinct city-states that operated like small nations.
They were loosely linked by language and spiritual belief but lacked centralized control.
The earliest cities were Uruk, Ur, and Eridu, and eventually there were a dozen cities. Each had a king who served a role somewhere between a priest and a ruler.
(Beeps) [Countdown] (Clapboard claps) Ten years is a long time for us humans on earth.
Ten turns around the sun.
When I was on the TED stage a decade ago, I talked about planetary boundaries that keep our planet in a state that allowed humanity to prosper.
The main point is that once you transgress one, the risks start multiplying.
The planetary boundaries are all deeply connected, but climate, alongside biodiversity, are core boundaries.
They impact on all others.
Back then we really thought we had more time.
The warning lights were on, absolutely, but no unstoppable change had been triggered.
Since my talk, we have increasing evidence that we are rapidly moving away from the safe operating space for humanity on earth.
Climate has reached a global crisis point.
We have now had 10 years of record-breaking climate extremes: fires blaze in Australia, Siberia, California and the Amazon, floods in China, Bangladesh and India.
We're now enduring heat waves across the entire northern hemisphere.
We risk crossing tipping points that shift the planet from being our best resilient friend, dampening our impacts, to start working against us, amplifying the heat.
For the first time, we are forced to consider the real risk of destabilizing the entire planet.
Our children can see this.
They are walking out of school to demand action, looking with disbelief at our inability to deviate away from potentially catastrophic risks.
The next 10 years, to 2030, must see the most profound transformation the world has ever known.
This is our mission.
This is the countdown.
(Clock ticks) When my scientific colleagues summarized, about a decade ago, for the first time, the state of knowledge on climate tipping points, just one place had strong evidence that it was on a serious downward spiral.
Arctic sea ice. (Water sounds) Other tipping points were long way off -- 50 or 100 turns around the sun.
Just last year we revisited these systems, and I got the shock of my career.
We are only a few decades away from an Arctic without sea ice in summer.
In Siberia, permafrost is now thawing at dramatic scales.
Greenland is losing trillions of tons of ice and may be approaching a tipping point.
The great forests of the North are burning with plumes of smoke the size of Europe.
The Atlantic ocean circulation is slowing.
The Amazon rainforest is weakening and may start emitting carbon within 15 years.
Half of the coral of the Great Barrier Reef has died.
West Antarctica may have crossed the tipping point already today.
And now, the most solid of glaciers on earth, East Antarctica, parts of it are becoming unstable.
Nine out of the 15 big biophysical systems that regulate climate are now on the move, showing worrying signs of decline and potentially approaching tipping points.
Tipping points bring three threats.
First, sea level rise.
We can already expect up to one meter this century.
This will endanger the homes of 200 million people.
And third, these systems are all linked like dominoes: If you cross one tipping point, you lurch closer to others.
Let's stop for a moment and look at where we are.
The foundation of our civilization is a stable climate and a rich diversity of life.
Everything, I mean everything, is based on this.
Civilization has thrived in a Goldilocks zone: not too hot, not too cold.
This is what we have had for 10,000 years since we left the last ice age.
Let's zoom out a little here.
Three million years -- temperatures have never broken through the two degrees Celsius limit.
Earth has self-regulated within a very narrow range of plus two degrees in a warm interglacial, minus four degrees, deep ice age.
Now, we are following a path that would take us to a three to four degree world in just three generations.
We would be rewinding the climate clock, not one million, not two million, but five to 10 million years.
We are drifting towards hot-house earth.
For each one degree rise, one billion people will be forced to live in conditions that we today largely consider uninhabitable.
This is not a climate emergency, it is a planetary emergency.
My fear is not that Earth will fall over a cliff on the 1st of January, 2030. My fear is that we press unstoppable buttons in the Earth system.
What happens in the next 10 years will likely determine the state of the planet we hand over for future generations.
Our children have every reason to be alarmed.
We need to get serious about stabilizing our planet.
Two frontiers will guide this transformation.
The first one is in science.
Here's a new equation for a sustainable planet: planetary boundaries plus global commons equals planetary stewardship.
We need to a safe corridor for humanity to allow us all to become stewards of the entire planet, not to save the planet but to provide a good future for all people.
And the second frontier is in society.
We need a new economic logic based on well-being.
We are now in a position to provide science-based targets for all global commons for all companies and cities in the world.
First task, we need to cut global emissions by half by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 or sooner.
This means decarbonizing the big systems that run our lives: energy, industry, transport, buildings.
The fossil fuel era is over.
We need to transform agriculture from a source of emissions to a store of carbon, and critically, we must protect our oceans and land, the natural ecosystems that absorb half of our emissions.
The good news is, we can do this.
We have the knowledge. We have the technology.
We know it makes social and economic sense.
And when we succeed, we can all take lungfuls of fresh air.
We will be saying hello to healthy lifestyles and resilient economies in livable cities.
We are all on this journey around the sun together.
This is our only home.
This is our mission: to protect our children's future.
Thank you.

Fighting climate change has become the greatest responsibility of our times.
And this is why in Europe, we have set our objective: to become the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. This means leading an entire continent towards transitioning to clean energy, reinventing our infrastructure, and much, much more.
It may sound abstract, and it sounds huge.
And yes, it's actually both.
And it is also possible.
Why?
In the European Union, we have a good record of turning ambitions into successes.
We are a political and economic union with 27 countries and the total population of 450 million people.
On the ashes of two world wars, we have secured lasting peace among us.
From a divided continent, we have created a union without borders.
And I strongly believe we can also achieve our next challenge: becoming the first carbon-neutral continent.
When I became president of the European Commission, I sent a clear signal.
In the first two weeks, I tabled the European Green Deal.
This European Green Deal is both our vision for a climate-neutral continent and a very dedicated road map to this goal.
It is 50 actions for 2050, ranging from the first-ever European climate law, to circular economy, to a biodiversity strategy, planting trees, protecting precious nature and animals, recycling and waste management, just to name a few.
When the coronavirus pandemic hit, we resolved not to let our objective be derailed.
The economic and social crisis created by the pandemic cannot be an excuse to postpone the transition towards a cleaner and healthier future.
On the opposite, they create an additional accelerator to mobilize and to move ahead.
Of course, not everyone agreed.
Some in the industry told us it was impossible to remain competitive under these new constraints.
Some unions were afraid jobs would be lost and workers forgotten.
Some politicians said it was not realistic.
We listened to them, but we also listened to other facts and arguments: the large international support to the Paris Agreement, science with robust data, and more data every year, the evidence of climate shifting all around us.
We all know it by now: glaciers melting, forest fires, more extreme weather events.
And this is just the beginning.
We saw the prospect of many new jobs created by the transition; European citizens, who, in their overwhelming majority, consider that climate change is a very serious problem; our youth demanding action for their future, and rightly so.
Building on this, in September 2020, we announced we would go one step further.
We moved from a 40 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to an at least 55 percent reduction by 2030. We are taking this bold commitment for two reasons.
First, we already know that we need to push further if we're serious about reaching our 2050 objective, which we are.
They are also necessary.
Solving climate change will help solve a host of other problems.
Ignoring it will only precipitate them, as we see with the link between the loss of biodiversity and zoonotic viruses like the coronavirus.
I know some are concerned with this transition, and I want to tell them these concerns are legitimate.
But we have the knowledge, we have the technology, we have now the resources to accompany this change and make this transition just.
We are directing our recovery in this direction.
If we get it right, a third of our recovery money, called Next Generation EU, and of our long-term budget will go to climate goals and climate projects.
And this is more than 600 billion euros.
Now, addressing climate change will need more than politicians and more than a continent.
States, companies, cities, citizens everywhere need to move in the same direction and to sustain their action over the long term.
The European Union is open to cooperate with anyone who's ready to engage in this journey.
Fixing climate change calls for everyone's action every day.
You can count on me.
I count on you.
Thank you.
I've got to start by admitting that in many ways me giving a talk about how climate action can help Black communities is surprising.
I grew up poor and Black with a single mother in Tottenham, one of the most deprived areas in London, in the 1970s and '80s.
Climate change was the last thing on my mind.
And representing Tottenham as its member of Parliament for the past 20 years, my focus has been on trying to reduce the deprivation I grew up around.
In the past, the climate crisis never featured at the forefront of my politics because it was never one of the most immediate challenges my constituents were facing, or at least it didn't feel like it.
Rising sea levels feel unimportant when your bank balance is falling.
Global warming is not your concern when you can't pay the heating bills.
And you're not thinking about pollution when you're being stopped by the police.
And so perhaps this is why as the Black Lives Matter movement roared across the world, there's been so little mention of saving Black lives from the climate emergency.
For too long, those of us who cared about racial justice treated environmental justice as though it was elitist.
And at the same time, the leaders who did focus on climate change were usually white and rarely bothered to enlist the support of Black voices in their work.
Even progressive allies sometimes took our votes for granted and assumed that our community didn't care or wouldn't understand.
The truth is the opposite is true.
Black people breathe in the most toxic air relative to the general population.
We are more likely to suffer from respiratory diseases like asthma.
And it is people of color who are more likely to suffer in the climate crisis.
This is no coincidence.
The cheapest housing tends to be next to the busiest roads, and many of the lowest paid jobs are in the most polluting industries.
People of color consistently lie at the bottom of the housing, educational and employment ladders.
This story connects Black communities across the world, from London to Lagos to LA. Black Americans are exposed to 56 percent more pollution than they cause.
White Americans breathe 17 percent less air pollution than they produce.
It gives a whole new meaning to the Black Lives Matter slogan "I can't breathe.
" We all rightly know the name of George Floyd, who was murdered by the police.
But we should also know the name of Ella Kissi-Debrah.
Ella, a nine-year-old mixed-race girl from South East London, was killed by a fatal asthma attack.
Evidence suggests this was caused partly by the unlawful levels of air pollution near her home.
And it's not only urban areas where Black lives are disproportionately under threat from climate change.
My parents' home country of Guyana is one of the most vulnerable countries on Earth to the effects of climate change.
So far, Guyana has contributed relatively little to the climate emergency, but it's one of the countries facing the most serious threats from it.
While the annual carbon dioxide emissions per head in the United States is a staggering 16.5 metric tons, in Guyana it's just 2.6. It is a pattern repeated across the globe.
Those countries that have contributed least to the climate breakdown, mainly in the global south, will suffer the most from floods, droughts, and rising temperatures.
This is a pattern of suffering with a long history.
The exploitation of our planet's natural resources has always been tied to the exploitation of people of color.
The logic of colonization was to extract valuable resources from our planet through force, paying no attention to its secondary effects.
The climate crisis is in a way colonialism's natural conclusion.
And let me say something about how we build this new movement and what it must look like.
First, we need a recognition that the climate movement is not only about protecting the planet.
It is primarily about caring for the people who live on the planet.
Globally as well as nationally, we need to recognize structural imbalances and inequalities.
A radical green recovery plan should provide jobs to the people who've been disenfranchised for centuries, new jobs planting trees, insulating buildings and working on green technologies.
We cannot tackle the climate crisis without addressing racial inequalities.
And we cannot solve racial inequalities without fixing the economic system.
The new deal the economy needs is not only green, it's green and Black.
This is a picture the Associated Press put out.
Here is the original image.
And please also march for the Indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest, as Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro weakens its protections.
We need a way to apply international criminal laws, like war crimes or crimes against humanity, to the planet.
The Black Lives Matter movement needs to wake up to climate injustices just as the climate movement must make every effort to include the reality of people of color.
The good news is that things are changing.
I live in Amsterdam, where a profound transformation is underway.
By 2025, the zone expands and all public and commercial traffic must be emissions-free.
Public buses, coaches, taxis, vans, small, medium and large trucks.
Living here and witnessing firsthand how Amsterdam becomes a front-runner of electric mobility is a powerful reminder that the big societal imperative of halving carbon emissions by 2030 goes beyond nudging people away from personal cars.
Cities cannot do this alone, so we need national governments to play a fundamental role too.
California just passed a rule that requires that 50 percent of the sales of trucks in the state are zero-emissions by 2035 and all of them must be zero-emission by 2045. This is a game changer for the trucking industry.
Vehicle manufacturing is shifting towards electrification.
Look at some of the milestones, which were unthinkable a few years back.
Volkswagen has converted a traditional plant into one that will produce only electric vehicles.
Daimler is halting all the development of internal combustion engines.
This year, public charging plugs hit the one million mark around the world.
Fleet owners are shifting towards zero-emission models.
These are still small steps compared to the scale of our oil addiction, but they signal a new direction of travel.
What's really exciting is that the technologies we need for this transformation are here today, commercially available, getting cheaper and getting better.
Look at batteries.
Their cost went down 90 percent in 10 years, and there are new opportunities to repurpose these batteries for energy storage or to recycle them once they wear down.
The race to zero needs capital.
So we need more urgency and directionality in the financial industry because it is heavily invested in fossil fuels.
To reach scale and speed, we will need clever combinations of finance and policy.
China has a fleet of 420,000 electric buses compared to 600 in the entire United States. To put that into perspective, Santiago de Chile alone has 455 electric buses, and growing, thanks to an ingenious financial arrangement.
Africa now has its first manufacturing plant of electric buses.
And P4G, a global initiative, is working with emerging economies that want to scale up the electrification of buses.
There is, and there will be, resistance to change.
Exponential change can bring turmoil if the decline of old industries is not managed.
Hello, everyone.
Growing up in my family gives you a certain sense of history.
I'm simply the latest in a line that can be traced back generations.
By the time that Henry VIII lived here, they'd grown into mature, impressive giants.
Over my grandmother's lifetime, the last 90 years or so, our impacts accelerated so fast that our climate, oceans, air, nature and all that depends on them are in peril.
This oak has stood here for centuries, but never has it faced a decade like this.
We start this new decade knowing that it is the most consequential period in history.
This oak has stood here for centuries, but never has it faced a decade like this.
It is the most vulnerable, those with the fewest resources and those who've done the least to cause climate change who will be impacted the most.
These stark facts are terrifying.
How can we hope to fix such massive intractable problems?
It may seem overwhelming, but it is possible.
Humans have an extraordinary capacity to set goals and strive to achieve them.
I've long been inspired by President John F. Kennedy's 1961 mission to put a man on the moon within a decade.
He named it the Moonshot.
It seemed crazy.
We'd only just launched the first satellite. Putting a man on the moon that quickly seemed impossible.
But this simple challenge encompassed so much.
He called it a goal to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills.
In taking that giant leap for mankind, the team behind the Moonshot united millions of people around the world -- that this crazy ambition wasn't so crazy after all.
And along the way, it helped the invention of breathing equipment, CAT scanners and solar panels.
But now, rather than a Moonshot for this decade, we need Earthshots.
We must harness that same spirit of human ingenuity and purpose and turn it with laser sharp focus and urgency on the most pressing challenge we have ever faced, repairing our planet.
The shared goals for our generation are clear.
Together, we must protect and restore nature, clean our air, revive our oceans, build a waste-free world and fix our climate.
And we must strive to do all of this in a decade.
If we achieve these goals, by 2030 our lives won't be worse, and we won't have to sacrifice everything we enjoy.
Instead, the way we live will be healthier, cleaner, smarter and better for all of us.
The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the funds flowing into the economic recovery demonstrate how much can be achieved when those in positions of power come together and decide to act.
We built hospitals overnight, repurposed factories, poured billions into the search for a vaccine and better treatments.
And we've been inspired by heroes emerging in every community across the world.
Young people no longer believe that change is too difficult.
They witnessed the world turn on its head.
They believe that the climate crisis and the threat to our biodiversity deserves our full attention and ambition.
And they're right.
So now is the time for each one of us to show leadership.
I'm committed to using the unique position that I have to help set those Earthshot goals and reward people across every sector of society and in every part of the world who do their bit to help achieve them.
Some people are motivated to act by a crisis, but for many, the incentive to act only comes when they believe that change is possible, that it isn't a lost cause.
If people really believe that these challenges, these Earthshots, are possible, just imagine all the potential we will unleash.
I'm determined to both start and end this decade as an optimist. Whilst our generation represents just a blip in the lifetime of these magnificent oaks, we have the power and potential to ensure that they and all life on earth thrive for another thousand years and more.
But only if we now unleash the greatest talents of our generation to repair our planet.
We have no choice but to succeed.
Thank you.
[His Holiness Pope Francis Filmed in Vatican City First shown at TED Countdown Global Launch, October 2020] Hello!
We are living during a historic moment, marked by difficult challenges, as we all know.
The world is shaken by the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlights another global challenge: the socio-environmental crisis.
And this requires us, all of us, to face a choice.
The choice between what matters, and what doesn’t.
The choice between continuing to ignore the suffering of the poorest and to abuse our common home, our planet, or engaging at every level to transform the way we act.
Science tells us, every day, with more precision, that urgent action is needed -- and I am not dramatizing, this is what science says -- if we are to keep the hope of avoiding radical and catastrophic climate change.
And for this we must act now.
This is a scientific fact.
Our conscience tells us that we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of those in need, to the growing economic inequalities and social injustices.
And that the economy itself cannot be limited to production and distribution.
It must also consider its impacts on both the environment and on the dignity of people.
Made not so much of words, but rather of concrete and pressing actions.
I am calling it a journey because it requires a shift, a change.
From this crisis none of us must come out the same -- we cannot come out the same: from a crisis, we never come out the same -- and it will take time, and hard work, to overcome it.
We will have to take it one step at a time; help the weak; persuade those in doubt; imagine new solutions; and commit to carry them out.
Our goal is clear: to build, within the next decade, a world where we can meet the needs of the present generations, including everyone, without compromising the possibilities of future generations.
I would like to invite all people of faith, Christian or not, and all people of good will, to embark on this journey, starting from your own faith, or if you do not have a faith, from your own intention, from your own goodwill.
Each one of us, as individuals, or members of a group -- families, communities of faith, businesses, associations, institutions -- can make a substantial contribution.
Five years ago I wrote the encyclical letter "Laudato Si’," dedicated to the care of our common home.
It proposes the concept of "integral ecology," to respond together to the cry of the Earth, as well as to the cry of the poor.
Integral ecology is an invitation to an integral vision on life, starting from the conviction that everything in the world is connected and that, as the pandemic made sure to remind us, we are interdependent on each other, as well as on our Mother Earth.
From such a vision stems the need to find new ways of defining progress and measuring it, without limiting ourselves to the economic, technological, financial and gross-product aspects, but rather, giving central relevance to its ethical, social and educational dimensions.
I would like to propose today three courses of action.
As I wrote in "Laudato Si’," the change and the right orientation for our journey of integral ecology require first that we all take an educational step.
So, my first suggestion is to promote, at every level, an education geared towards the care of our common home, developing the understanding that environmental problems are linked to human needs.
We must understand this from the beginning: environmental problems are tied to human needs.
An education based on scientific data and on an ethical approach.
This is important: both of them.
I am encouraged by the fact that many young people already show a new ecological and social awareness, and many of them fight generously for the defense of the environment and for justice.
As a second proposal, we must focus on water and nutrition.
Access to safe and drinkable water is an essential and universal human right.
It is essential because it determines the survival of people and therefore is a condition for the exercise of all other rights and responsibilities.
Providing adequate nutrition for all, through non-destructive farming methods, should become the main purpose of the entire cycle of food production and distribution.
The third suggestion is about energy transition: a gradual replacement, but without delay, of fossil fuels with clean energy sources.
We only have a few years.
Scientists estimate approximately less than 30 -- we have a few years, less than 30 -- to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.
Not only must this transition be quick and capable of meeting present and future energy needs, it also must be attentive to the impact on the poor, on local populations, as well as on those who work in the energy production sectors.
Many organizations, Catholic and of other faiths, have already taken on the responsibility to act in this direction.
In fact, the Earth must be worked and nursed, cultivated and protected.
We cannot continue to squeeze it like an orange.
And we can say that this -- taking care of the Earth -- is a human right.
These three proposals must be considered as part of a larger group of actions that we must carry out in an integrated way in order to find a lasting solution to these problems.
The current economic system is unsustainable.
We are faced with the moral imperative, and the practical urgency, to rethink many things: the way we produce; the way we consume; our culture of waste; our short-term vision; the exploitation of the poor and our indifference towards them; the growing inequalities and our dependence on harmful energy sources.
We need to think about all these challenges.
Integral ecology suggests a new conception of the relationship between us humans and Nature.
This leads to a new economy, where the production of wealth is directed to the integral well-being of the human being and to the improvement -- not the destruction -- of our common home.
It also implies a renewed politics, conceived as one of the highest forms of charity.
Yes, love is interpersonal, but love is also political.
" As the term Countdown suggests, we must act with urgency.
Each one of us can play a valuable role, if we all begin our journey today -- not tomorrow -- today.
Because the future is built today, and it is not built in isolation, but rather in community and in harmony.

Thank you.
You might think that working remotely is an introvert's dream: you're in your own home hidden behind a computer, possibly in your pajamas.
But the truth is, for many introverts, remote work is kind of a nightmare.
[TED: The Way We Work] [Made possible with the support of Dropbox] Now that the pandemic has chased many of us out of our offices, we're chafing under the new remote rules of work: too much screen time; a lack of boundaries between work and home; endless video calls.
The same things that make remote work difficult for introverts make it difficult for everyone.
Far and away, the worst part of remote work is video calls.
Being on camera is a performance.
Thoughtless scheduling can mean you're basically onstage performing for eight hours a day.
There are none of the nuanced cues that help you read a room.
Staring at disembodied heads on a screen offers only a pale imitation of real human connection.
Social anxiety only makes this worse.
When you have a camera in your face, that can really trigger your social anxiety.
It takes energy to be on.
So the key to managing remote work is to protect your energy.
First, pay attention to ritual and routine.
As much as we hated our commutes, they were a ritual that created a boundary between work and home.
And we need that.
For many of us, those little breaks that we would build in to the work day -- going to get a cup of coffee or a chat with a coworker -- those are gone, too.
For me, those rituals are when I gather my energy, assume my work character and get into the right headspace to dive in.
So how can you recreate those breaks and boundaries at home?
The key is to be intentional.
It could be music or lighting, a pep talk with a friend.
You could take a walk around the block at a certain time of day or even a breathing or stretching routine before you sit -- whatever it takes for you to delineate the transition between work and home.
Second, we need to manage our pace, place and space.
You can think of pacing as managing the interactions that tax your energy versus those that recharge you.
You could schedule fewer videoconferences, because remember, those are performances.
You could schedule downtime or recharge time after performances.
Oprah does this, as do many introverted performers and CEOs.
You could consider the time of day.
Think about when you can typically summon the energy to be on and save other times for quiet work.
For place, use your workspace to help you enforce good boundaries.
Even if your desk is in your kitchen, make it feel like a workplace.
For space, build in some alone time every day.
And this includes time away from your kids.
Finally, if you're a manager, you have a special role to play to help employees protect their pace, place and space.
Brainstorming can trigger social anxiety, and it can freeze up introverts.
Favor audio over video calls.
Try asynchronous communication for more complicated or provocative one-on-ones.
You can steal this idea from author Robert Glazer: record a voice memo or video on your phone explaining your perspective and send it to a colleague.
Build something better.
To get started, ask the introverts in your office what their ideal day looks like and take your cue from there.
About 10,000 years ago, humans began to farm.
Spread all over the world, these agricultural lands are the pieces to a global puzzle we are all facing: in the future, how can we feed every member of a growing population a healthy diet?
That's not an option the next time around.
The farm may look haphazard but is a delicately engineered use of the land that intertwines crops and livestock with wild habitats.
This information reduces unnecessary water use and tells farmers where they should apply more and less fertilizer instead of causing pollution by showering it across the whole farm.
In the United States, ranchers are raising cattle on grasslands composed of native species, generating a valuable protein source using production methods that store carbon and protect biodiversity.
In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, new approaches to rice production may dramatically decrease greenhouse gas emissions in the future.
Rice is a staple food for three billion people and the main source of livelihood for millions of households.
More than 90 percent of rice is grown in flooded paddies, which use a lot of water and release 11 percent of annual methane emissions, which accounts for one to two percent of total annual greenhouse gas emissions globally.
By experimenting with new strains of rice, irrigating less and adopting less labor-intensive ways of planting seeds, farmers in these countries have already increased their incomes and crop yields while cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions.
In Zambia, numerous organizations are investing in locally specific methods to improve crop production, reduce forest loss and improve livelihoods for local farmers.
These efforts are projected to increase crop yield by almost a quarter over the next few decades.
If combined with methods to combat deforestation in the region, they could move the country toward a resilient, climate-focused agricultural sector.
And in India, where up to 40 percent of post-harvest food is lost or wasted due to poor infrastructure, farmers have already started to implement solar-powered cold storage capsules that help thousands of rural farmers preserve their produce and become a viable part of the supply chain.
It will take all of these methods, from the most high-tech to the lowest-cost, to revolutionize farming.
High-tech interventions stand to amplify climate- and conservation-oriented approaches to farming, and large producers will need to invest in implementing these technologies.
Meanwhile, we'll have to expand access to the lower-cost methods for smaller-scale farmers.
This vision of future farming will also require a global shift toward more plant-based diets and huge reductions in food loss and waste, both of which will reduce pressure on the land and allow farmers to do more with what they have available.
If we optimize food production, both on land and sea, we can feed humanity within the environmental limits of the earth, but there's a very small margin of error, and it will take unprecedented global cooperation and coordination of the agricultural lands we have today.
My name is Sevidzem Ernestine Leikeki. I'm a climate activist from the North-West Region of Cameroon.
I focus on two things: caring for nature and educating the next generation to do the same.
We can't fight the climate emergency if we cannot protect and regenerate our land.
That's why my colleagues and I at Cameroon Gender and Environment Watch are dedicated to regenerating the 20,000-hectare Kilum-Ijim Forest.
My community of 300,000 people depends on nature for livelihood.
We find daily solutions in our forest and in our farmlands.
But our natural resources face a lot of challenges: deforestation, over-exploitation, encroachment and poor soil conservation.
And these are made worse by gender inequality, cultural barriers and little or no knowledge about the goodness of nature.
Worst of them are the devastating bushfires.
To make sure that this forest continues to exist into the future, we work to educate our children that if they protect the forest, it will, in turn, support them.
We educate our children what it means to love nature and treat it with care.
I call that "raising a forest generation.
" To date, my organization has provided environmental education to more than 50,000 people in the Kilum-Ijim Forest area, 60 percent of them women.
We have child-friendly sessions every week in our nurseries about the trees found in our forest and how to take care of them.
We have trained over 2,000 people in the Kilum-Ijim Forest area in bee farming.
When we recruit bee farmers, that's a chance to rebalance opportunities.
We give two beehives to women and one to men.
We also teach them about honey production, beeswax extraction, making honey wine and honey juice, and making detergents and lotions out of beeswax.
When they tend their hives, the community keeps an eye out for bushfires.
And the income from bee farming means they can plant more trees.
It's a powerful equation.
Honey equals income, equals jobs, equals gender equality, equals conservation.
As of 2020, we have planted 86,000 trees to regenerate the Kilum-Ijim Forest.
Nature remains our greatest ally to reach our climate mitigation targets.
Planting trees is essential, but we need to raise a forest generation that will thrive and live in harmony with nature.
Thank you.
Where does all the carbon we release go?
Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere and in rocks deep underground.
When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon.
But over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas.
Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock.
And human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon.
Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year.
That overloads Earth's carbon cycle and builds up in the atmosphere and oceans.
Planting more trees will help, but trees alone can't get us to net zero.
There's only one sure way to stop global warming.
We must stop releasing this excess carbon into our air.

No squatters allowed.
I don't care if you're a ghost.
In fact, I once carried a takeout container across half the city just to put it in the right bin.
All of seventh grade can't be recycled.
Now, a lot of US recycling goes straight to landfills.
So, if you're American, hound your political representatives to work on this recycling issue, and try to create less waste overall by reusing materials.
I probably can.
In fact, I'm going to give it to that old ghost lady as a going away present.
Thank you.You might not know this just from looking at me, but you might guess it from smelling me.
One of my favorite things to do is take out the trash.
Getting rid of people never hurts either.
Roommates, family members, that old lady who's been in your living room for weeks. Who is she anyway?
No squatters allowed.
I don't care if you're a ghost.
Also, not to brag, but I've been micro-decluttering since before Marie Kondo got big.
In fact, I've cut out her step of picking things up and figuring out whether they spark joy in me because I already know what sparks joy in me, throwing out trash.
What kind of trash?
Well, I'll give you a clue.
It starts with H and it ends with air.
That's right, it's a lot of hair.
Don't try and picture how much; you'll feel sick.
And if you don't feel sick, you haven't pictured enough.
I shed like an Instagram influencer sheep dog who's decided fur is the only thing holding her career back.
We're all trying to reduce our carbon footprints and consumption.
So by throwing out trash, I also naturally mean recycling and composting.
I try to do both.
In fact, I once carried a takeout container across half the city just to put it in the right bin.
Where's my inspiring biopic?
But then I learned recycling frequently isn't working.
Even if we all separate out glass, cans and cardboard, a lot of stuff doesn't neatly fit into those categories.
Paper envelopes lined with bubble wrap can't be recycled.
Pizza boxes with grease stains can't be recycled.
That memory from seventh grade when I . . . Ah, who am I kidding?
All of seventh grade can't be recycled.
There's even a term for it: aspirational recycling.
At first, I thought that's if you went to spin class last week, so it should count for this week too.
China used to import a lot of the US's recyclables, but they stopped accepting foreign garbage in 2018 as part of a pollution ban.
Whatever happened to one country's trash is another country's treasure?
Now, a lot of US recycling goes straight to landfills.
The EPA says that only 10 percent of plastic has ever been recycled.
Not that this is about me, but this balloons my anxiety the size of the giant Pacific garbage patch way out in the ocean where we'll all eventually go for our next destination wedding.
So, if you're American, hound your political representatives to work on this recycling issue, and try to create less waste overall by reusing materials.
Here's stuff I've been reusing in my life: plastic bags, salsa jars and old fights with my boyfriend.
Humans do not see trees.
But as writers, as much as we love stories and words, I believe we must also be interested in silences: the things we cannot talk about easily in our societies, the marginalized, the disempowered.
And the present does not move in one direction.
Next time you walk by a tree, try to slow down and listen because each of us whispers in the wind.
(Soft sound) I was very inspired by youth movements, how young people actually have organized themselves in order to be heard.
For some time now, I have in fact collaborated with young people -- they are the artists as well, in this case -- to make a project "Earth Speakr," where we, the grown-ups, can listen to them.
So join me in listening to them talking about the environment, and about the climate, about the future, and see what they have to say.
Girl 1: With "Earth Speakr," I can share my voice to anything I see.
It's a platform for us to speak up and for the world to hear us.
I could put a face on anything around me and say my message.
Hey, excuse me, I can see you.
(Recorded voice) Hey, excuse me.
I can see you.
Kids can be the experts.
All you have to do is listen.
(German) I am hungry!
(Polish) I was so dry before I got watered!
(Portuguese) Hello!
My message would be that all houses should have solar panels!
(French) Hey, I am Willy from the Earth!
Girl 3: Imagine every place being as green as me. This can be your future.
OE: See?
Their imagination is just so inspiring, I think, and gives me hope also, frankly speaking.
So in "Earth Speakr," only kids can speak, and the grown-ups are listening, right?
Of course, I still have an ask for you, as a grown-up, go and make a Speakr message with a kid and send it out into the world.
Make sure that the kid feels "Wow!
Somebody's listening to me.
" Because if we do that, I think the future might be shaping in the right direction.
When we come together, we can find the answers.
All you have to do is listen.
Boy 1: Fight for our future.
(Italian) Help me to live 1,000 years more.
(German) I am hungry!
Boy 2: It's our future, and it's getting hotter.
(Recorded voice) It's our future, and it's getting hotter.
If I see a message I like, I can share it with my friends and family.
Girl 2: It's so cool because we can share our voices, we can hear others, and that's how we know that we're not alone in this fight.
And if enough of us make messages, then the grown-ups will have to listen to us.
Then we can really make a change in the world.
(Polish) I was so dry before I got watered!
(Portuguese) Hello!
My message would be that all houses should have solar panels!
(French) Hey, I am Willy from the Earth!
Girl 3: Imagine every place being as green as me. This can be your future.
OE: See?
Their imagination is just so inspiring, I think, and gives me hope also, frankly speaking.
So in "Earth Speakr," only kids can speak, and the grown-ups are listening, right?
Of course, I still have an ask for you, as a grown-up, go and make a Speakr message with a kid and send it out into the world.
Make sure that the kid feels "Wow!
Somebody's listening to me.

Thank you.
In November 2015, 197 countries came together in Paris and agreed to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase on our planet to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The Climate Action Tracker monitors the climate commitments and actions of 36 countries, totalling roughly 80 percent of today's global greenhouse gas emissions.
Here's the bad news: those emissions are still rising and have already warmed the globe by 1.1 degrees Celsius.
The tracker makes two problems clear.
First, countries have not set emissions targets ambitious enough to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Even if every country hit their targets, the temperature would still increase by more than two degrees Celsius over the next 70 years, and continue to rise into the 22nd century and beyond.
Second, governments are simply not delivering even on their unambitious targets.
Everything these 36 countries have done so far, and everything they are currently planning, will only slow the growth in emissions.
We need to do more than that.
To have a hope of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, we need to cut global emissions in half by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050. Let's go through the numbers.
Of the 36 countries analyzed, only two are taking enough action to restrain global warming to 1.5 degrees.
The Gambia has pledged to reduce its emissions, despite being one of the developing countries that has contributed least to the problem.
And Morocco is building more and more solar power.
Every other country is failing.
2020 is the year national governments were supposed to come together and strengthen their targets.
Now, some countries aren't too far behind The Gambia and Morocco, such as India and Kenya.
The United States is currently withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.
China shows promise; its pledge to balance out its carbon emissions by 2060 could save the world as much as 0.3 degrees Celsius of global warming.
But actions on the ground remain divided.
China is the largest market for wind and solar power, but also for new coal-fired power plants.
Clean power can enable other sectors to reduce or eliminate emissions.
More than 50 countries, 30 regions, 160 cities and 200 businesses have committed to 100 percent clean electricity.
In November 2015, 197 countries came together in Paris and set targets to fight climate change.
These targets were already insufficient to reach the stated goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and most are not on track to achieve even their own inadequate targets.

But actions on the ground remain divided.
China is the largest market for wind and solar power, but also for new coal-fired power plants.
And the EU is taking steps in the right direction with its green deal to make member countries more sustainable. But this deal is still not enough for 1.5 degrees.
So are there any signs of hope?
One key measure is a country's willingness to clean up electricity.
Clean power can enable other sectors to reduce or eliminate emissions.
More than 50 countries, 30 regions, 160 cities and 200 businesses have committed to 100 percent clean electricity.
Denmark, Scotland and the state of South Australia are almost there already, but much of the world still needs to commit to, and accelerate, this energy transition.
There's more good news in the transportation sector.
More than 20 countries, five regions, 50 cities and 60 businesses have already committed to 100 percent emission-free cars, motorcycles and buses.
Norway is mandating the end of all sales of fossil fuel cars by 2025. Meanwhile, the US is allowing companies to make cars that don't travel as far on a gallon of gas, rolling back fuel efficiency standards.
Other sectors, such as steel and cement-making or aviation and shipping, are even further behind and trickier to clean up.
But some steel and cement companies are developing carbon-free production, and Norway and Scotland are targeting carbon-free short-haul flights.
In November 2015, 197 countries came together in Paris and set targets to fight climate change.
These targets were already insufficient to reach the stated goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and most are not on track to achieve even their own inadequate targets.
We need more ambitious targets and much more ambitious actions.
In the next decade, we need to transform key sectors of the global economy in order to reduce emissions.
These changes will be difficult but not impossible, because they will also bring enormous opportunities like creating millions of jobs. And don't lose track of this key point: such a transformation will also mean cleaner air and a safer, more stable climate for all.
What is net zero?
We release 55 gigatons of greenhouse gases into the air every year.
To stop global warming, we have to get our greenhouse gas emissions down to zero.
But for every country to immediately shut down all greenhouse gas-releasing activities would be an enormous challenge, especially since some countries have built up an economic head start with no restrictions.
So instead, we can use an approach called net zero.
Net zero means that for every molecule of greenhouse gas we put into the air, we also take one out, making our net emissions zero.
Net zero requires us to make big changes today, use less more efficiently, and even bigger technological changes for the future, like replacing all greenhouse gas-emitting activities with clean ones.
We'll also have to capture greenhouse gases from the air and store them permanently.
And yet, net zero is our best chance for a sustainable future.

Every second, a huge amount of energy smashes into our greenhouse.
The result is a planet with temperatures too hot for our liking and, eventually. . . living. [Countdown Take action on climate change at Countdown. ted. com]Why is the world warming up?
Let's think of Earth for just a moment as a greenhouse.
Much of that heat used to escape back into space, keeping us at a stable, warm temperature.
Because of the company's scale . . . Jesper Brodin: The carbon footprint of IKEA is about 0.1 percent of the global emission of carbon.
RH: . . . that's a lot of carbon. And that was Jesper Brodin, CEO of Ingka Group, which operates IKEA Retail.
And this is Pia Heidenmark Cook, their head of sustainability.
We will look at price and low price, because our vision is to be for the many people, it needs to be affordable. But it's also about form, function, sustainability and quality.
RH: How does IKEA balance sustainability and persuading buyers to consume things during the climate crisis?
PHC: It really means looking at the entirety of our business.
So it's really looking at: How do we build circular design metrics into our products?
But then also, how do we engage and reach out to customers, so, looking at new service models like furniture as a service, starting now testing with business-to-business.
RH: In 2019, IKEA's business grew by 6.5 percent. But the company decreased its global carbon footprint by 4.3 percent, beginning to decouple growth and emissions.
JB: That step for us was -- it gave a lot of confidence and optimism, to be honest, showing that it's possible to grow and at the same time, move in the right direction when it comes to carbon.
RH: Yes, fine, but how can you make that shift durable and expand that decoupling?
JB: There are some myths that we need to rid ourselves from. The consumption myth is one.
That sustainability should come at a premium is a very dangerous myth, that purpose and profit couldn't go hand in hand -- it's the opposite.
RH: Why should people trust you?
JB: Trust is maybe the most important thing to get into the system and into the conversation.
I think to start with, you have to look at intentions. And scrutinize is, of course, one part of the equation here.
But when you look at the reasons why it's important for us to move in this topic, it makes business sense, from the point that coworkers and customers will expect us to be -- and already today expect us to be -- a leader.
And thereby, it would be dangerous for your brand if you wouldn't take the lead in your segment.
But last, I think, which is most intriguing for me, is that sustainability is the new low cost, it is the new model of the world.
It's not in contrast to doing good business, but the opposite.
RH: What response are you getting from coworkers and from partners?
PHC: Super positive response from our coworkers, and sustainability, in our internal survey I share, is actually the number two reason why people choose to work for IKEA and stay at IKEA.
And the number one reason is all the lovely colleagues that we have.
RH: The climate crisis is also a crisis of justice and fairness.
How is IKEA thinking about that?
PHC: We definitely see that climate change is a human rights issue, and we know that those with thin wallets or even no wallets are the most impacted by climate change.
So what we do is, both through the IKEA Foundation, which is our philanthropic arm, we're working through various climate activities in developing countries and have put aside about 150 million euro in the last two years.
Then, in Ingka, where we have shopping centers and stores and fulfillment centers, we're working with refugees and looking at how can we create skills for employment programs, where we do skills training and language training. RH: Companies generally think quarter by quarter.
Climate is a long-term challenge that needs immediate action.
How do you square that?
JB: We are actually foundation-owned, so we have less of the quarterly pressure.
And our founder was amazing in thinking and planning long-term.
And I actually recall one of the last meetings I had with him a few years ago, before he passed away.
We asked him how we should think and plan, and he said, "You should think long-term.
" And when we asked him, "How long-term?
" he said, "Yeah, well, 200 years.

In 1903, the President of the United States took a three-day camping trip in California’s Yosemite Valley.
President Theodore Roosevelt slept in a grove of towering Sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours talking around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir.
Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping: Yosemite was in danger.
In 1851, a state-sanctioned militia, drove the Ahwahneechee tribe from Yosemite Valley.
Those who managed to return witnessed white settlers claiming the land, felling giant sequoias, and building hotels and saloons.
In response, a small group of concerned Californians lobbied senator John Conness to protect the valley from private interests.
In 1864, Congress passed Conness’ bill, granting the Yosemite Valley to the State of California, marking the first time the U. S. government brought land under public protection.
But the management of that land remained an open question, one that would only become more complicated as more lands came under similar protection.
Seven years later, geologist Ferdinand Hayden led an expedition to the Yellowstone Plateau, which many Native American tribes used for ceremonies, hunting, and trade.
The expedition’s scientists and artists brought back news of spectacular geysers and hot springs, inspiring widespread support to bring Yellowstone under government protection— and restrict native people’s access to the land.
However, unlike Yosemite, Yellowstone couldn’t be granted to a state— it was part of three U. S. territories that hadn’t become states yet.
Instead, Congress brought Yellowstone under federal stewardship in 1872, creating the world’s first true National Park.
During his presidency, Teddy Roosevelt was instrumental in expanding the lands under public protection.
By 1916, there were fifteen national parks.
But the problem of management remained unsolved, and maintenance of the park was handled haphazardly over multiple government departments.
Straightforward tasks like building roads and hiring personnel required inefficient bureaucratic maneuvering.
None of the departments had set rules for conduct in the park, so hunters killed park wildlife, cattle overgrazed fields, and visitors vandalized landmarks.
The solution came from Canada, which had a highly effective centralized park service.
In 1916, the United States established the National Park Service based on this model.
To this day, the mission for the park service is comprised of two goals that sometimes conflict: to conserve the parks for the future and to allow the public to enjoy them.
That’s a delicate balancing act: roads, trails, and other infrastructure make the parks accessible to visitors, but also alter the landscape, while visitors themselves can contribute to pollution, erosion, and damage of delicate ecosystems.
The very history of preservation can also be at odds with this mission.
Many parks were not, at the time of their founding, the uninhabited wilderness that’s become the standard for their preservation.
Instead, many were homes or places of worship for native peoples, who lost access to these lands in the name of public use.
Only recently has the National Park Service begun to reckon with this legacy and engage Native Americans in park management.
Around the world, indigenous communities play crucial roles in land management and preservation.
Today, there are thousands of national parks worldwide, and each must balance public use with historical and ecological preservation.
Parks in New Zealand, Iceland, Australia, and South Africa have experienced severe erosion as visitor numbers have skyrocketed.
Some, like Mu Ko Similan National Park in Thailand, have closed sections to tourists entirely to allow the ecosystem to recover.
National Parks have preserved irreplaceable landscapes for future generations.

I'm a human rights lawyer.
I've been a human rights lawyer for 30 years, and this is what I know.
Once there was a man alone in a room.
And his name was Alton.
And then seven other men, seven strangers, rushed into his room and dragged him out. And they held him in a horizontal, crucifix position.
One on each arm, two on each leg, and the seventh man held Alton's neck in a vice-like grip between his forearms.
And Alton was struggling for breath and saying, "I can't breathe," just as George Floyd said, "I can't breathe.
" But they didn't stop.
And soon, Alton was dead.
When I was asked to represent his mother and his brother and his sister in the inquest into his death, they asked me, "How could it happen?
" And I didn't have an answer.
Because Alton had injuries all over his body.
He had bruising to his neck and his torso.
He had injuries to his arms and his legs.
He had blood in his eyes, his ears and his nose.
But they claimed no one knew anything.
They claimed that they couldn't explain how he died.
For Alton had two problems.
Firstly, the corridor in which he died was a prison corridor.
And secondly, he was Black.
So I want to talk to you today about Alton's mother's question.
How could such a thing happen in our country?
How can these things happen in countries across the world?
How can they happen still, and what could we do to stop it?
For three decades, I've been representing the families of people of color who have been killed in state custody in the United Kingdom.
And I've done human rights work across four continents.
And what I've learned is this: that if we want to do something about racism, we have to first understand what it is.
So let's talk about this thing called race.
What exactly is it?
A fact of our lives?
One of the most powerful forces in the world?
Something we don't particularly want to talk about?
It is all these things, but it is something else.
It is a myth.
There is no such thing as race.
For example, someone of European descent might be genetically closer to an Asian person than to someone else of European descent.
Which means it's been invented.
But by whom and for what reason?
As a species, we share 99.9 percent of DNA with everybody else.
But visible external characteristics, like hair type and skin color, have been used in order to promote this racist genetic lie about the supposed racial genetic differences.
Racism has been endemic for centuries.
The Nazis, of course, were very keen to promote the racist lie.
We have social inequalities that are justified by race.
The apartheid regime said it was nature and so it was inevitable and there was nothing you could do about it.
The Mother Nature lie gives discrimination and injustice a pass.
I've also found it in cases where people suffer from the legacy of colonization and empire.
I've seen similar effects amongst people of the same color in Africa.
And so you can see why people are so keen to embrace the race thing.
The simple truth is that race is a system.
It protects power and privilege.
Whose?
You already know.
Or someone recently arrived from South Asia, who is a Hindu?
Or someone who's recently crossed the US-Mexican border?
It's not because of the color of their skin.
And you realize that you do know, you do understand that people will judge them.
Your bristling isn't just defensiveness.
It is a defense mechanism.
And the summer season was full of blood.
So I'm asking you to see through the lies.
And I would say to each of them, "Look at Mrs. Manning, Alton's mother, and you tell her why her son is dead. " And not a single one of them could look at her.
They wanted her to be invisible.
Now we can't say that we didn't know.
We have voting power, we have pocket power, where we spend our money and what we spend it on.
And this is what I know.
When someone in state custody says, "I can't breathe," they are in mortal danger.
But when a society doesn't challenge the oxygen of racism that everyone breathes every day, the hope for racial justice and equality in that society is also in mortal danger.
There can't be any more Altons, and Gareths and Zahids, and Olasenis and Jimmys and Seans and Sherrys and Breonnas and Christophers and Georges.
But this isn't just about deaths, but about life.
And about our human flourishing together.
Racism wants to stay invisible. Expose it.
I've been a human rights lawyer for 30 years, and this is what I know.
One on each arm, two on each leg, and the seventh man held Alton's neck in a vice-like grip between his forearms.
And Alton was struggling for breath and saying, "I can't breathe," just as George Floyd said, "I can't breathe.
When I was asked to represent his mother and his brother and his sister in the inquest into his death, they asked me, "How could it happen?
For example, someone of European descent might be genetically closer to an Asian person than to someone else of European descent.
So if race isn't a biological fact, what actually is it?
It is a social construct.
Which means it's been invented.
But by whom and for what reason?
As a species, we share 99.9 percent of DNA with everybody else.
But visible external characteristics, like hair type and skin color, have been used in order to promote this racist genetic lie about the supposed racial genetic differences.
Racism has been endemic for centuries.
The Nazis, of course, were very keen to promote the racist lie.
But also, in the United States, there were eugenic experiments and eugenic laws.
And in Australia, children of dual Aboriginal heritage were confiscated from their parents in order to create a white Australia.
This kind of thinking is rising again with alt-right groups hankering after racially pure homelands.
How does this work?
You see, we don't have social inequalities because of race.
We have social inequalities that are justified by race.
I started to understand this when I was representing anti-apartheid activists. And they showed me how apartheid was a system of social exploitation and discrimination that was justified by race.
By the supposed superiority of white people and the supposed inferiority of Black people.
The apartheid regime said it was nature and so it was inevitable and there was nothing you could do about it.
The Mother Nature lie gives discrimination and injustice a pass.
I've also found it in cases where people suffer from the legacy of colonization and empire.
I've seen similar effects amongst people of the same color in Africa.
And how people of certain castes are looked down upon in India.
The victims may be different, but the mechanism -- the labeling and the lies -- is exactly the same.
And so you can see why people are so keen to embrace the race thing.
Because it gives the privileged, people like us, a get out of jail free card.
The simple truth is that race is a system.
It's like oxygen, like an atmosphere.
It flows everywhere in our society.
It infects everybody it touches.
It protects power and privilege.
Whose?
Well, look around you.
So what is it like for people of color, people like me, to try to speak to white people about racism?
Many, many white people find it extremely difficult to do.
Some white people say they know nothing about it.
Others say that our societies may not even suffer from racism at all.
So if you are a white person who is wondering about all of this, there is a thought experiment that you can do.
Because here's the truth.
You know.
You already know.
So ask yourself this: Would you, would you really want your son or your daughter, your brother or your sister, to marry a practicing Muslim from the Middle East?
Or someone recently arrived from South Asia, who is a Hindu?
Or an asylum seeker from Sub-Saharan Africa?
Or someone who's recently crossed the US-Mexican border?
You may not have a total objection, but you may have a concern.
A qualm that scratches at the back of your brain.
It's not because of the color of their skin.
But because you know that in countries like ours, as things stand now, their life prospects are likely to be affected by this union.
And you realize that you do know, you do understand that people will judge them.
And in a hundred ways, those judgments will impact their lives and the lives of their children.
Which is that you know systemic racism is real.
So why do you not want to talk about race?
Because it's uncomfortable, certainly.
The bigger truth is far more damaging.
Your bristling isn't just defensiveness.
It defends the system of privilege and the unequal division of wealth and power.
Who are the winners and losers?
In income.
In stop and search.
Or is there another way?
Because almost everyone in this TED Talk will say that they are non-racist.
So if you agree that Black lives matter, ask yourself, "How do Black lives matter in my life?
After weeks of bitter struggle at the inquest, the all-white jury returned to the courtroom in Alton's case.
So how does Alton's death connect to you and to the racism and privilege in our societies?
What do I want from you?
What I want from myself is to be put out of a job.
You see, families come to me who are grieving and I see the hope in their eyes.
And I have to tell them that the chances of anybody ever being prosecuted for being involved in the killing of their loved ones are very remote.
I saw these grieving faces in the springtime of my career.
And I still see them now that I'm entering the autumn of it.
And the summer season was full of blood.
And somehow I think that the blood is on my hands, even though I know rationally that that is not the case. But I could not bring back Alton or Gareth or Zahid or any of the others, which is all their grieving families ever wanted.
So I'm asking you to see through the lies.
And to see through one of the most disempowering lies of them all.
That what we do will not and cannot make a difference.
I'm sure they said that to Rosa Parks and to Martin Luther King and to Nelson Mandela.
And they just went ahead and did it anyway.
And I tried to think of them as I was cross-examining the prison officers.
And I would say to each of them, "Look at Mrs. Manning, Alton's mother, and you tell her why her son is dead. " And not a single one of them could look at her.
They wanted her to be invisible.
Sadly, realizing that no one would be prosecuted for her boy's death, she sank into a deep depression and she died.
But I'll never forget how, in the chaos and mayhem, when that verdict was announced, I turned to her and said, "Mrs. Manning, I'm very sorry for your family.
" And she looked at me and said, "Mr. Dias, you are family.
" And she pointed at the prison officers and the jury and she said, "And they are family.
But families bicker and fight, but we've got to sort it out.
And we've got to find a way.
" So how do we sort it out and when? Dr. King taught us the time is always right to do the right thing.
These contentious deaths in state custody have taken place in prisons and in police stations.
But finally, the spotlight has been shone on them by the horrendous death of George Floyd.
Now we can't say that we didn't know.
The COVID crisis and George Floyd's death have shocked us out of our complacency.
They put the world in flux, because what has been seen cannot be unseen.
So right now is a historic moment of change.
Now is the time to take action in our spheres of influence, and we all have them.
We have voting power, we have pocket power, where we spend our money and what we spend it on.
We have the power to confront racism wherever and whenever we find it.
Those of you listening today, who have benefited from that privilege, have the opportunity to turn it on its head and to demand that society changes. Ultimately what happens is now in our hands.
And this is what I know.
When someone in state custody says, "I can't breathe," they are in mortal danger.
But when a society doesn't challenge the oxygen of racism that everyone breathes every day, the hope for racial justice and equality in that society is also in mortal danger.
There can't be any more Altons, and Gareths and Zahids, and Olasenis and Jimmys and Seans and Sherrys and Breonnas and Christophers and Georges.
But this isn't just about deaths, but about life.
And about our human flourishing together.
And all of us are needed for that.
Racism wants to stay invisible. Expose it.
Racism wants your silence.
Make a noise.
Racism wants your apathy.
Make a commitment now to use your voice and your privilege and your power to fight for racial justice always, and to join the crescendo of voices calling for change.
And to be part of the hope.
Will you join us?
It's funny how foreigners ask me the same questions when they first meet me. Questions like, "Wow, you're from Mongolia?
So do you ride horses to go to work?
" "Do you know what Coke is?
" Or, "Do you have chocolates in Mongolia?
" And if I want to have fun with it, I say things like, "Oh my God, I've never heard any of those before. What are Coke and chocolates?
Can you tell me more about them?
" It always works, and we have a good laugh about it too. In reality, our capital city, Ulaanbaatar, is very urban.
So I set off to the countryside, driving along dirt roads for hours.What's incredible about Mongolian nomads is that the neighbors are often 40 kilometers apart, and there's no private land ownership of pasture land in Mongolia.
And guess what?He said I could stay as long as I needed to, on one condition.
He asked if I would play the morin khuur, our traditional Mongolian horsehead fiddle. In my head, I couldn't believe it was coming true.
And the horsehead fiddle was like a ticket.
When Mongolians find out that you can play morin khuur, you're instantly respected. They say its two strings express all the events of the world.
I ended up staying with them for nine days, and they didn't even ask me to leave.
Because nomads live in extremely remote areas, they are completely at the mercy of nature.
Heavy snowfall, a sudden flood or a raging storm can devastate a nomadic family.
Today, it's a stranger who needs help, but tomorrow, it could be you. That's why they look out for each other and welcome anyone in need of help.
This really touched my heart, because I feel like we humans are becoming more and more selfish. Staying with a truly nomadic family awakened me.
It was nothing like I've ever seen in developed countries. The wife of the family showed me how they produce organic dairy products from scratch, like white cheese, yogurt, tsegee, and even a traditional vodka made from cow milk.
And every tool they use is made from natural material by hand.
And inside the yurt, we burned dried cow dung to stay warm instead of using fuel. Everything stood in sharp contrast to my city life filled with plastic and steel.
They invited me in, offered me food and gave me a place to stay if I needed it.I was surprised by how little they owned.
At first, I thought it was because they moved about four times a year. OK, that's a very simple logic to understand. You only carry what you need.
But then I learned there's a deeper philosophy behind it.
Historically, nomads believed that we are only passing through this life, that people come and leave naked, so they believe that there's no point in building anything that destroys nature or in being greedy for materialistic things when your life expectancy is only less than 100 years.
I digitalized all of my company's paper procedures. What once took 20 packs of A4 paper now takes just one.
I downsized my apartment, reduced my carbon footprint and picked up a habit to rethink my actions, like purchasing, choosing transportation, and many other lifestyle choices at home and work.
And most importantly, I stopped working on fast-moving consumer-goods marketing projects and now work with organizations that promote sustainability.
But by far the biggest change is that I've started to see development with fresh eyes. In cities, living in a traditional yurt as a nomad and having less is often interpreted as a sign of poverty, not just abroad but at home in Mongolia too.
We think that the end goal for every developing country is to become the next Tokyo or New York City, with their skyscrapers, big shopping malls and toll roads.
Communities around the world are abandoning their traditional lifestyles in pursuit of material wealth.
But let's not forget, the developed countries are the ones most responsible for climate change. So we have to ask ourselves, why do we keep on following the same blueprint when we know it causes harm to the world?
We've all experienced the consequences of our choices over the past eight months.
So doing right by Mother Nature and focusing on earth-friendly, zero-waste habits is not an option anymore.
And who knows the key ingredients better than our ancestors, the ones who survived without the media or technology but with wisdom alone?
As a citizen of Mongolia, I grew up hearing that developing countries are inferior, and I really took it to heart.
But today, I want to say loud and clear that I don't see disadvantages from developing countries anymore.
On the contrary, I see countries that have the biggest opportunity to do things in the right way, countries that can define their own kind of development and have the most advantage to build a better and safer environment for everyone.
What worked for our ancestors for thousands of years can work for us now, and in the future, when combined with the latest innovations.
After all, we're all guests in this world, so let's do right by the earth and each other just like the ancient Mongolian nomads did. Thank you.It's funny how foreigners ask me the same questions when they first meet me. Questions like, "Wow, you're from Mongolia?
So do you ride horses to go to work?
" "Do you know what Coke is?
" Or, "Do you have chocolates in Mongolia?

But it's a haunting beauty, because Montpelier was also a slave labor camp.
When I visited for the first time, the director of education, Christian Cotz -- cool white dude -- (Laughter) took me almost immediately to the library.
And it was amazing, being able to stand in this place where such an important moment in American history happened.
So this is what I'm thinking about while I'm supposed to be a historian. (Laughter) But then, I actually do feel these impressions in the brick. I feel these ridges in the brick. And it takes a second to realize what they are.
(Laughter) Sometimes, we try to rationalize hard history.
" A "good master?
" There is no such thing as a good master.
George Santayana, the Spanish writer and philosopher, said that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Now as a historian, I spend a lot of time thinking about this very statement, and in a sense, it applies to us in America.
And a harsh reality is, we haven't.
Consider the racial wealth gap. Wealth is generated by accumulating resources in one generation and transferring them to subsequent generations.
Median white household wealth is 147,000 dollars. Median Black household wealth is four thousand dollars.
How do you explain this growing gap?
Hard history.
My great-great-grandfather was born enslaved in Jasper County, Georgia, in the 1850s.
While enslaved, he was never allowed to accumulate anything, and he was emancipated with nothing. He was never compensated for the bricks that he made.
My great-grandfather was also born in Jasper County, Georgia, in the 1870s, and he actually managed to accumulate a fair bit of land.
But then, in nineteen-teens, Jim Crow took that land from him.
And then Jim Crow took his life.
My grandfather, Leonard Jeffries Senior, was born in Georgia, but there was nothing left for him there, so he actually grew up in Newark, New Jersey. And he spent most of his life working as a custodian.
Job discrimination, segregated education and redlining kept him from ever breaking into the middle class.
And so when he passed away in the early 1990s, he left to his two sons nothing more than a life-insurance policy that was barely enough to cover his funeral expenses.
Now my parents, both social workers, they actually managed to purchase a home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York, in 1980, for 55,000 dollars.
Now Crown Heights, at the time, was an all-Black neighborhood, and it was kind of rough.
My brother and I often went to sleep, by the mid-1980s, hearing gunshots.
But my parents protected us, and my parents also held onto that home.
For 40 years.
And they're still there.
But something quintessentially American happened about 20 years ago.
About 20 years ago, they went to sleep one night in an all-Black neighborhood, and they woke up the next morning in an all-white neighborhood. (Laughter) And as a result of gentrification, not only did all their neighbors mysteriously disappear, but the value of their home skyrocketed.
So that home that they purchased for 55,000 dollars -- at 29 percent interest, by the way -- that home is now worth 30 times what they paid it for.
Thirty times.
Do the math with me.
That's 55,000 times 30, carry the zeros -- That's a lot of money.
And it's not because family members haven't saved, haven't worked hard, haven't valued education.
It's because of hard history.
So when I think about the past, my concern about not remembering it is not that we will repeat it if we don't remember it. My concern, my fear is that if we don't remember the past, we will continue it.
We will continue to do the things that created inequality and injustice in the first place.
So what we must do is we must disrupt the continuum of hard history.
And we can do this by seeking truth.
By confronting hard history directly.
By magnifying hard history for all the world to see.
We can do this by speaking truth.
Teachers teaching hard history to their students.
To do anything else is to commit educational malpractice.
And parents have to speak truth to their children, so that they understand where we have come from as a nation.
And finally, we must all act on truth.
Individually and collectively, publicly and privately, in small ways and in large ways.
We must do the things that will bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice.
To do nothing is to be complicit in inequality. History reminds us that we, as a nation, stand on the shoulders of political giants like James Madison.
But hard history reminds us that we, as a nation, also stand on the shoulders of enslaved African American children.
Little Black boys and little Black girls who, with their bare hands, made the bricks that serve as the foundation for this nation.
And if we are serious about creating a fair and just society, then we would do well to remember that, and we would do well to remember them. Thank you. (Applause)Not that long ago, I received an invitation to spend a few days at the historic home of James Madison.
James Madison, of course, was the fourth president of the United States, the father of the Constitution, the architect of the Bill of Rights.
And as a historian, I was really excited to go to this historic site, because I understand and appreciate the power of place.
Now, Madison called his estate Montpelier. And Montpelier is absolutely beautiful.
It's several thousand acres of rolling hills, farmland and forest, with absolutely breathtaking views of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
But it's a haunting beauty, because Montpelier was also a slave labor camp.
You see, James Madison enslaved more than 100 people over the course of his lifetime.
And he never freed a single soul, not even upon his death.
The centerpiece of Montpelier is Madison's mansion.
Now this is where James Madison grew up, this is where he returned to after his presidency, this is where he eventually died.
And the centerpiece of Madison's mansion is his library.
This room on the second floor, where Madison conceived and conceptualized the Bill of Rights.
When I visited for the first time, the director of education, Christian Cotz -- cool white dude -- (Laughter) took me almost immediately to the library.
And it was amazing, being able to stand in this place where such an important moment in American history happened.
But then after a little while there, Christian actually took me downstairs to the cellars of the mansion.
It's also where they were installing a new exhibition on slavery in America.
And while we were there, Christian instructed me to do something I thought was a little bit strange.
Now look, I was going to be staying on-site on this former slave plantation for a couple of days, so I wasn't trying to upset any white people.
What they are are tiny hand prints. Because all of the bricks at James Madison's estate were made by the children that he enslaved.
And that's when it hit me that the library in which James Madison conceives and conceptualizes the Bill of Rights rests on a foundation of bricks made by the children that he enslaved.
It's hard history, because it's difficult to imagine the kind of inhumanity that leads one to enslave children to make bricks for your comfort and convenience.
It's hard history, because it's hard to talk about the violence of slavery, the beatings, the whippings, the kidnappings, the forced family separations.
It's hard history, because it's hard to teach white supremacy, which is the ideology that justified slavery.
(Laughter) Sometimes, we try to rationalize hard history.
So why do we do this?
About 20 years ago, they went to sleep one night in an all-Black neighborhood, and they woke up the next morning in an all-white neighborhood. (Laughter) And as a result of gentrification, not only did all their neighbors mysteriously disappear, but the value of their home skyrocketed.

I'm a political and social psychologist.
I study how people understand the world and what this means for society and for democracy . . . which, as it turns out, is quite a lot.
Some people see the world as safe and good, and this allows them to be OK with uncertainty and to take time to explore and play.
Others are acutely aware of threats in their environment, so they prioritize order and predictability over openness and experimentation.
In my academic research, I study how these two approaches shape how we think and feel about everything from art to politics.
I also explore how political elites and partisan media use these very differences to engender hatred and fear and how the economics of our media system exploit these same divides.
But after studying this, I have come away not with a sense that we are doomed to be divided but that it's up to us to see both sets of traits as necessary and even valuable.
Take for example two men who have been so influential in my own life.
First, my late husband, Mike.
He was an artist who saw the world as safe and good.
He welcomed ambiguity and play in his life.
In fact, we met through improv comedy where he taught improvisers to listen and be open and to be comfortable not knowing what was going to happen next.
After we got married and had our baby boy, Mike was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
And through months of hospitalizations and surgeries, I followed Mike's lead, trying to practice being open, trying to be OK not knowing what was going to happen next.
It was Mike's tolerance for ambiguity that allowed me to survive those months of uncertainty, and that helped me explore new ways to rebuild my life after he died.
About a year and a half after Mike passed away, I met my current husband, PJ.
PJ is a criminal prosecutor who sees the world as potentially good provided that threats are properly managed.
He also is someone who embraces order and predictability in his daily routine, in the foods that he eats, in his selection of wardrobe.
And PJ has a vicious wit, but he's also morally very serious with a strong sense of duty and purpose.
And he values tradition, loyalty and family, which is why at the age of 28 he did not hesitate to marry a widow, adopt her baby boy and raise him as his son.
It was PJ's need for certainty and closure that brought stability to our lives.
I share these two stories of Mike and PJ not just because they're personal, but because they illustrate two things that I have found in my own research.
First, that our psychological traits shape how we engage with the world, and second, that both of these approaches make all of our lives possible.
Tragically though, political and economic incentives of our media environment seek to exploit these differences to get us angry, to get our attention, to get clicks and to turn us against one another.
And it works.
It works in part because these same sets of traits are related to core political and cultural beliefs.
For years, political psychologists have studied how our psychological traits shape our political beliefs.
We've conducted experiments to understand how our psychology and our politics shape how we respond to apolitical stimuli.
And this research has shown that those people who are less concerned with threats, who are tolerant of ambiguity, these people tend to be more culturally and socially liberal on matters like immigration or crime or sexuality.
In my experimental work, I've also found that these differences help explain why ironic, political satire is more likely to be appreciated and understood by liberals than conservatives.
On the other hand, those people who are monitoring for threats, who prefer certainty and closure, those tend to be our political, cultural, social conservatives.
Because they're on alert, they also make decisions quickly and efficiently, guided by intuition and emotion.
And we've found that these traits help explain why conservatives enjoy political opinion talk programming that clearly and efficiently identifies threats and enemies.
What is essential though is that these propensities are not absolute -- they're not fixed.
There are liberals who are monitoring for threats just as there are conservatives who are tolerant of ambiguity.
In fact, PJ's political beliefs are not that radically different from those that Mike held.
The link between psychology and politics is contingent on context: who we're with and what's going on around us.
The problem is that right now, our dominant context, our political and media context, actually needs these differences to be absolute, to be reinforced and even to be weaponized.
For reasons related to power and profit, some in politics and media want us to believe that those people who approach the world differently from us -- the Mikes or the PJs -- themselves are dangerous.
And social media platforms use algorithms and microtargeting to deliver divisive messages in our preferred messaging aesthetic.
Messages that relate to politics, culture and race.
And we see the devastating effects of these messages every single day.
Americans who are angry and fearful of the other side.
Charges of the other side destroying America.
But stop and think for a moment. What would happen if those differences had never been weaponized?
It is liberal inclinations towards openness and flexibility that allow us to cope with uncertainty and that allow us to explore new paths towards innovation, creativity -- scientific discovery.
Think of things like space travel or cures for diseases or art that imagines and reimagines a better world.
And those conservative inclinations towards vigilance and security and tradition.
These are the things that motivate us to do what must be done for our own protection and stability.
Think of the safety that's offered by our armed forces or the security of our banking system.
Or think about the stability that's offered by such democratic institutions as jury duty, or cultural traditions like fireworks on the Fourth of July.
What if the real threat posed to society and democracy is not actually posed by the other side?
What if the real danger is posed by political and media elites who try to get us to think that we'd be better off without the other side and who use these divisions for their own personal, financial, political benefit?
Mike and PJ engaged with the world very differently, but these distinct approaches continue to enrich my life every day.
Instead of our political and media context determining that the other side is the enemy and lulling us into believing that that's true, what if we choose to create the context?
Real people connecting with other real people, appreciating these two approaches for what they are: necessary gifts that can help us all survive and thrive together.
Thank you.I'm a political and social psychologist.

Some people get what they deserve, and some people don't, and that's just the way it is.
When you ratchet up requirements as colleges have done, what you do is you create a crazy competition among high school kids, because it's not adequate to be good, it's not adequate to be good enough, you have to be better than everybody else who is also applying.
And what this has done, or what this has contributed to, is a kind of epidemic of anxiety and depression that is just crushing our teenagers.
We are wrecking a generation with this kind of competition.
As I was thinking about this, it occurred to me there's a way to fix this problem.
In other words, we do college admissions by lottery, and maybe we do job offers at tech companies by lottery, and -- perish the thought -- maybe we even make decisions about who gets invited to talk at TED by lottery.
Now, don't misunderstand me, a lottery like this is not going to eliminate the injustice.
There will still be plenty of people who don't get what they deserve.
But at least it's honest.
It reveals the injustice for what it is instead of pretending otherwise, and it punctures the incredible pressure balloon that our high school kids are now living under.
So why is it that this perfectly reasonable proposal, if I do say so myself, doesn't get any serious discussion?
I think I know why.
I think it's that we hate the idea that really important things in life might happen by luck or by chance, that really important things in our lives are not under our control.
I hate that idea.
It's not surprising that people hate that idea, but it simply is the way things are.
Take me.
Almost all the most significant events in my life have occurred, to a large degree, as a result of good luck.
When I was in seventh grade, my family left New York and went to Westchester County.
Right at the beginning of school, I met a lovely young girl who became my friend, then she became my best friend, then she became my girlfriend and then she became my wife.
Happily, she's been my wife now for 52 years.
I had very little to do with this.
This was a lucky accident.
I went off to college, and in my first semester, I signed up for a class in introduction to psychology.
I didn't even know what psychology was, but it fit into my schedule and it met requirements, so I took it.
And by luck, the class was taught by a superstar introductory psychology teacher, a legend.
Because of that, I became a psychology major.
Went off to graduate school.
I was finishing up.
A friend of mine who taught at Swarthmore decided he didn't want to be a professor anymore, and so he quit to go to medical school.
The job that he occupied opened up, I applied for it, I got it, the only job I've ever applied for.
I spent 45 years teaching at Swarthmore, an institution that had an enormous impact on the shape that my career took.
And to just give one last example, I was giving a talk about some of my work in New York, and there was somebody in the audience who came up to me after my talk.
He introduced himself.
He said, "My name is Chris.
Would you like to give a talk at TED?
" And my response was, "What's TED?
" Well, I mean, he told me, and TED then wasn't what it is now.
But in the intervening years, the talks I've given at TED have been watched by more than 20 million people.
So the conclusion is, I'm a lucky man.
I'm lucky about my marriage.
I'm lucky about my education.
I'm lucky about my career.
And I'm lucky to have had a platform and a voice at something like TED.
Did I deserve the success I've had?
Sure I deserve that success, just as you probably deserve your success.
But lots of people also deserve successes like ours who haven't had it.
So do people get what they deserve?
Is society just?
Of course not.
Working hard and playing by the rules is just no guarantee of anything.
What do we owe people who struggle, work hard and are less lucky than we are?
About a half century ago, the philosopher John Rawls wrote a book called "A Theory of Justice," and in that book, he introduced a concept that he called "the veil of ignorance.
" The question he posed was: If you didn't know what your position in society was going to be, what kind of a society would you want to create?
And what he suggested is that when we don't know whether we're going to enter society at the top or at the bottom, what we want is a society that is pretty damn equal, so that even the unlucky will be able to live decent, meaningful and satisfying lives.
So bring this back, all of you lucky, successful people, to your communities, and do what you can to make sure that we honor and take care of people who are just as deserving of success as we are, but just not as lucky.
Thank you.Hello, everybody.
I'm honored to be here to talk to you, and what I'm going to talk about today is luck and justice and the relation between them.
Some years ago, a former student of mine called me to talk about his daughter. It turns out his daughter was a high school senior, was seriously interested in applying to Swarthmore, where I taught, and he wanted to get my sense of whether she would get in.
Swarthmore is an extremely hard school to get into.
So I said, "Well, tell me about her.
" And he told me about her, what her grades were like, her board scores, her extracurricular activities. And she just sounded like a superstar, wonderful, wonderful kid. So I said, "She sounds fabulous.
She sounds like just the kind of student that Swarthmore would love to have.
" And so he said, "Well, does that mean that she'll get in?
" And I said, "No.
There just aren't enough spots in the Swarthmore class for everybody who's good. There aren't enough spots at Harvard or Yale or Princeton or Stanford.
There aren't enough spots at Google or Amazon or Apple.
There aren't enough spots at the TED Conference.
There are an awful lot of good people, and some of them are not going to make it.
" So he said, "Well, what are we supposed to do?
" And I said, "That's a very good question.
" What are we supposed to do?
And this violates a lot of people's sense of what justice and fairness is.
People in American society have different opinions about what it means to say that some sort of process is just, but I think there's one thing that pretty much everyone agrees on, that in a just system, a fair system, people get what they deserve.
And what I was telling my former student is that when it comes to college admissions, it just isn't true that people get what they deserve.
Some people get what they deserve, and some people don't, and that's just the way it is.
When you ratchet up requirements as colleges have done, what you do is you create a crazy competition among high school kids, because it's not adequate to be good, it's not adequate to be good enough, you have to be better than everybody else who is also applying.
And what this has done, or what this has contributed to, is a kind of epidemic of anxiety and depression that is just crushing our teenagers.
We are wrecking a generation with this kind of competition.
As I was thinking about this, it occurred to me there's a way to fix this problem.
In other words, we do college admissions by lottery, and maybe we do job offers at tech companies by lottery, and -- perish the thought -- maybe we even make decisions about who gets invited to talk at TED by lottery.
Now, don't misunderstand me, a lottery like this is not going to eliminate the injustice.
There will still be plenty of people who don't get what they deserve.
But at least it's honest.
It reveals the injustice for what it is instead of pretending otherwise, and it punctures the incredible pressure balloon that our high school kids are now living under.
So why is it that this perfectly reasonable proposal, if I do say so myself, doesn't get any serious discussion?
I think I know why.
I think it's that we hate the idea that really important things in life might happen by luck or by chance, that really important things in our lives are not under our control.
I hate that idea.
It's not surprising that people hate that idea, but it simply is the way things are.
Take me.
Almost all the most significant events in my life have occurred, to a large degree, as a result of good luck.
When I was in seventh grade, my family left New York and went to Westchester County.
Right at the beginning of school, I met a lovely young girl who became my friend, then she became my best friend, then she became my girlfriend and then she became my wife.
Happily, she's been my wife now for 52 years.
I had very little to do with this.
This was a lucky accident.
I went off to college, and in my first semester, I signed up for a class in introduction to psychology.
I didn't even know what psychology was, but it fit into my schedule and it met requirements, so I took it.
And by luck, the class was taught by a superstar introductory psychology teacher, a legend.
Went off to graduate school.
I was finishing up.
The job that he occupied opened up, I applied for it, I got it, the only job I've ever applied for.
I spent 45 years teaching at Swarthmore, an institution that had an enormous impact on the shape that my career took.
And to just give one last example, I was giving a talk about some of my work in New York, and there was somebody in the audience who came up to me after my talk.
He introduced himself.
He said, "My name is Chris.
Would you like to give a talk at TED?
" And my response was, "What's TED?
Is society just?
Of course not.
And what he suggested is that when we don't know whether we're going to enter society at the top or at the bottom, what we want is a society that is pretty damn equal, so that even the unlucky will be able to live decent, meaningful and satisfying lives.
So bring this back, all of you lucky, successful people, to your communities, and do what you can to make sure that we honor and take care of people who are just as deserving of success as we are, but just not as lucky.
Thank you.
It was a cold, sunny March day.
There was still some snow around here and there, but the pavement was already clear and dry.
It says, "Where is your responsibility?
As I'm standing there considering its meaning, I notice I'm standing outside the Riga Municipality Social Welfare Department.
Now, in essence, that meant drastically reducing public budget spending, so, slashing public sector workers' wages, shrinking civil service, cutting unemployment benefits and other social assistance, raising taxes.
As a result of the crisis and the austerity, the Latvian economy shrank by 25 percent in a two-year period.
They were all registered as job seekers and hoping for some help from the state.
Yet, as I was soon discovering, this help was of a particular kind.
And a number of paradoxes struck me.
As a sociologist, I know that social policies are an important form of communication between the state and the citizen.
" She was, of course, citing Nike.
These types of social programs that emphasize individual responsibility have become increasingly common across the world.
They are part of the rise of what sociologist Loïc Wacquant calls the "neoliberal Centaur state.
" Now, the centaur, as you might recall, is this mythical creature in ancient Greek culture, half human, half beast.
In Latvia, we've had such a Centaur state model firmly in place since the '90s.
And the crisis and the austerity has made these kinds of social inequalities worse.
So while the capital of the banks and the wealthy has been protected, those who lost the most were taught lessons in individual responsibility.
After all, the crisis was not their fault, yet they were bearing the brunt of it.
But as people were sharing their stories with me, I was struck again and again by the power of the idea of responsibility.
She had been working for 23 years teaching sewing and other crafts at the vocational school in Riga.
And she was thinking pragmatically of starting a small business out of her bedroom making these little souvenir dolls to sell to tourists.
To one of our meetings, Aivars brings a book he's been reading.
It's called "Vaccination against Stress, or Psycho-energetic Aikido.
" Now, some of you might know that aikido is a form of martial art, so, psycho-energetic aikido.
And Aivars tells me that after several months of reading and thinking and reflecting while being out of work, he has understood that his current difficulties are really his own doing.
He says to me, "I created it myself.
I was in a psychological state that was not good for me.
If a person is afraid to lose their money, to lose their job, they start getting more stressed, more unsettled, more fearful.
That's what they get.
" As I ask him to explain, he compares his thoughts poetically to wild horses running in all directions, and he says, "You need to be a shepherd of your thoughts.
To get things in order in the material world, you need to be a shepherd of your thoughts, because it's through your thoughts that everything else gets orderly.
" "Lately," he says, "I have clearly understood that the world around me, what happens to me, people that enter in my life . . . it all depends directly on myself.
" So as Latvia is going through this extreme economic experiment, Aivars says it's his way of thinking that has to change.
He's blaming himself for what he's going through at the moment.
So taking responsibility is, of course, a good thing, right?
It is especially meaningful and morally charged in a post-Soviet society, where reliance on the state is seen as this unfortunate heritage of the Soviet past.
But when I listen to Žanete and Aivars and to others, I also thought how cruel this question is -- "Where is your responsibility? " -- how punishing.
Because, it was working as a way of blaming and pacifying people who were hit worst by the crisis.
So while Greeks were out in the streets, Latvians swallowed the toad, and many tens of thousands emigrated, which is another way of taking responsibility.
So the language, the language of individual responsibility, has become a form of collective denial.
As long as we have social policies that treat unemployment as individual failure but we don't have enough funding for programs that give people real skills or create workplaces, we are blind of the policymakers' responsibility.
As long as we stigmatize the poor as somehow passive or lazy but don't give people real means to get out of poverty other than emigrating, we are in denial of the true causes of poverty.
And in the meantime, we all suffer, because social scientists have shown with detailed statistical data that there are more people with both mental and physical health problems in societies with higher levels of economic inequality.
So social inequality is apparently bad for not only those with least resources but for all of us, because living in a society with high inequality means living in a society with low social trust and high anxiety.
So there we are. We're all reading self-help books, we try to hack our habits, we try to rewire our brains, we meditate.
And it helps, of course, in a way.
Self-help books help us feel more upbeat.
Meditation can help us feel more connected to others spiritually.
What I think we need is as much awareness of what connects us to one another socially, because social inequality hurts us all.
So we need more compassionate social policies that are aimed less at moral education and more at promotion of social justice and equality.
Thank you.
(Applause)It was a cold, sunny March day.
I was walking along the street in Riga.
I remember the winter was slowly coming to an end.
There was still some snow around here and there, but the pavement was already clear and dry.
If you've lived in Riga, you will know that feeling of relief that the first signs of spring bring, and you no longer have to trudge through that slushy mix of snow and mud on the streets.
So there I am, enjoying my stroll, as I suddenly notice a stencil on the pavement in front of me, a graffiti: white letters painted on these dark grey bricks.
It says, "Where is your responsibility?
" The question stopped me in my tracks.
As I'm standing there considering its meaning, I notice I'm standing outside the Riga Municipality Social Welfare Department.
So it appears that the author of this graffiti, whoever it is, is asking this question to people coming to apply for social assistance.
That winter, I had been doing research on the aftermath of the financial crisis in Latvia.
When the Global Financial Crisis erupted in 2008, Latvia got hit hard as a small, open economy.
To balance the books, the Latvian government chose a strategy of internal devaluation.
Now, in essence, that meant drastically reducing public budget spending, so, slashing public sector workers' wages, shrinking civil service, cutting unemployment benefits and other social assistance, raising taxes.
My mother had been working as a history teacher her whole life.
The austerity for her meant seeing her salary cut by 30 percent all of a sudden.
And there were many in a situation like hers or worse.
The costs of the crisis were put on the shoulders of ordinary Latvians.
As a result of the crisis and the austerity, the Latvian economy shrank by 25 percent in a two-year period.
Only Greece suffered an economic contraction of a comparable scale.
Yet, while Greeks were out in the streets for months staging continuous, often violent protests in Athens, all was quiet in Riga.
Prominent economists were fighting in the columns of "The New York Times" about this curious extreme Latvian experiment of this austerity regime, and they were watching on in disbelief how the Latvian society was putting up with it.
" So I started interviewing people I met at the unemployment office.
They were all registered as job seekers and hoping for some help from the state.
There was some cash benefit, but mostly state assistance came in the form of various social programs, and one of the biggest of these programs was called "Competitiveness-Raising Activities.
" It was, in essence, a series of seminars that all of the unemployed were encouraged to attend.
So I started attending these seminars with them.
So top income earners and large businesses can enjoy tax cuts and other supportive policies, while the unemployed, the poor are made to prove themselves worthy for the state's help, are morally disciplined, are stigmatized as irresponsible or passive or lazy or often criminalized.
Now, as I was talking to people who I met at these seminars, I was expecting them to be angry.
All this time, sewing, sewing, some kind of exhaustion.
She is analyzing herself.
And she was thinking pragmatically of starting a small business out of her bedroom making these little souvenir dolls to sell to tourists.
I also met Aivars at the unemployment office.
Aivars was in his late 40s, he had lost a job at the government agency overseeing road construction.
To one of our meetings, Aivars brings a book he's been reading.
It's called "Vaccination against Stress, or Psycho-energetic Aikido.
" Now, some of you might know that aikido is a form of martial art, so, psycho-energetic aikido.

(Applause)
We are witness to monumental human progress. Over the past few decades, the expansion of the global marketplace has lifted a third of the world's population out of extreme poverty. Yet we are also witness to an astounding failure.
Our efforts to lift people up have left behind those in the harshest forms of poverty, the ultra-poor.
What it means to be ultra-poor goes beyond the monetary definition that we're all familiar with: living on less than two dollars a day.
It goes even beyond not having assets like livestock or land.
To be ultra-poor means to be stripped of your dignity, purpose and self-worth.
It means living in isolation, because you're a burden to your own community.
It means being unable to imagine a better future for yourself and your family.
By the end of 2019, about 400 million people were living in ultra-poverty worldwide.
That's more than the populations of the United States and Canada combined.
And when calamity strikes, whether it's a pandemic, a natural disaster or a manmade crisis, these numbers spike astronomically higher.
My father, Fazle Abed, gave up a corporate career to establish BRAC here in Bangladesh in 1972. Bangladesh was a wreck, having just gone through a devastating cyclone followed by a brutal war for independence.
Working with the poorest of the poor, my father realized that poverty was more than the lack of income and assets.
It was also a lack of hope.
People were trapped in poverty, because they felt their condition was immutable.
Poverty, to them, was like the sun and the moon -- something given to them by God. For poverty reduction programs to succeed, they would need to instill hope and self-worth so that, with a little support, people could lift themselves out of poverty.
One, we meet a woman's basic needs by giving her food or cash, ensuring the minimum to survive.
Two, we move her towards a decent livelihood by giving her an asset, like livestock, and training her to earn money from it.
And four, we help to integrate her socially, first into groups of women like her and then into her community.
Each of these elements is key to the success of the others, but the real magic is the hope and sense of possibility the women develop through the close mentorship they receive.
Let me tell you about Jorina.
Jorina was born in a remote village in northern Bangladesh.
She never went to school, and at the age of 15, she was married off to an abusive husband.
With no one to turn to for help, she had no hope.
Researchers at the London School of Economics found that even seven years after entering the program, 92 percent of participants had maintained or increased their income, assets and consumption.
As he transitioned out of BRAC after leading the organization for 47 years, he reminded us that throughout his life, he saw optimism triumph over despair, that when you light the spark of self-belief in people, even the poorest can transform their lives.
Thank you.We are witness to monumental human progress. Over the past few decades, the expansion of the global marketplace has lifted a third of the world's population out of extreme poverty. Yet we are also witness to an astounding failure.

Poverty, to them, was like the sun and the moon -- something given to them by God. For poverty reduction programs to succeed, they would need to instill hope and self-worth so that, with a little support, people could lift themselves out of poverty.
BRAC went on to pioneer the graduation approach, a solution to ultra-poverty that addresses both income poverty and the poverty of hope.
The approach works primarily with women, because women are the most affected by ultra-poverty but also the ones most likely to pull themselves and their families out of it.
Over a two-year period, we essentially do four things.
One, we meet a woman's basic needs by giving her food or cash, ensuring the minimum to survive.
Two, we move her towards a decent livelihood by giving her an asset, like livestock, and training her to earn money from it.
Three, we train her to save, budget and invest her new wealth.
And four, we help to integrate her socially, first into groups of women like her and then into her community.
Each of these elements is key to the success of the others, but the real magic is the hope and sense of possibility the women develop through the close mentorship they receive.
Let me tell you about Jorina.
Jorina was born in a remote village in northern Bangladesh.
She never went to school, and at the age of 15, she was married off to an abusive husband.
He eventually abandoned her, leaving her with no income and two children who were not in school and were severely malnourished.
With no one to turn to for help, she had no hope.
Jorina joined BRAC's Graduation program in 2005. She received a dollar a week, two cows, enterprise training and a weekly visit from a mentor.
She began to build her assets, but most importantly, she began to imagine a better future for herself and her children.
If you were visit Jorina's village today, you would find that she runs the largest general store in her area.
She will proudly show you the land she bought and the house she built. Since we began this program in 2002, two million Bangladeshi women have lifted themselves and their families out of ultra-poverty.
That's almost nine million people.
The program, which costs 500 dollars per household, runs for only two years, but the impact goes well beyond that.
Researchers at the London School of Economics found that even seven years after entering the program, 92 percent of participants had maintained or increased their income, assets and consumption.
Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee, the MIT economists who won the Nobel Prize last year, led multicountry evaluations that identified graduation as one of the most effective ways to break the poverty trap.
But my father wasn't content to have found a solution that worked for some people.
He always wanted to know whether we were being ambitious enough in terms of scale.
So when we achieved nationwide scale in Bangladesh, he wanted to know how we could scale it globally.
And that has to involve governments.
Governments already dedicate billions of dollars on poverty reduction programs.
But so much of that money is wasted, because these programs either don't reach the poorest, and even the ones that do fail to have significant long-term impact.
We are working to engage governments to help them to adopt and scale graduation programs themselves, maximizing the impact of the billions of dollars they already allocate to fight ultra-poverty.
Our plan is to help another 21 million people lift themselves out of ultra-poverty in eight countries over the next six years with BRAC teams on-site and embedded in each country.
In July of 2019, my father was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and given four months to live.
As he transitioned out of BRAC after leading the organization for 47 years, he reminded us that throughout his life, he saw optimism triumph over despair, that when you light the spark of self-belief in people, even the poorest can transform their lives.
My father passed away in December.
He lit that spark for millions of people, and in the final days of his life, he implored us to continue to do so for millions more.
This opportunity is ours for the taking, so let's stop imagining a world without ultra-poverty and start building that world together.
Thank you.
Picture a world with a variety of landforms.
It has a dense atmosphere within which winds sweep across its surface and rain falls.
It has mountains and plains, rivers, lakes and seas, sand dunes and some impact craters.
Sounds like Earth, right?
This is Titan.
In August 1981, Voyager 2 captured this image of Saturn's largest moon.
The Voyager missions have traveled farther than ever before, making the solar system and beyond part of our geography.
But this image, this hazy moon was a stark reminder of just how much mystery remained.
We learned an exponential amount as the Voyagers flew by it, and yet we had no idea what lay beneath this atmospheric blanket.
Was there an icy surface with landforms like those of the other moons that had been observed at Saturn and Jupiter?
Or perhaps simply a vast global ocean of liquid methane?
Shrouded by the obscuring haze, Titan's surface was a huge, outstanding mystery that Cassini-Huygens, an orbiter lander pair launched in 1997, was designed to solve.
After arrival in 2004, the early images Cassini sent back of Titan's surface only heightened the allure.
It took months for us to understand what we were seeing on the surface, to determine, for example, that the dark stripes, which were initially so unrecognizable that we referred to them as cat scratches, were actually dunes made of organic sand.
Indeed, Titan is one of several ocean worlds, moons in the cold outer solar system beyond the orbits of Mars and the asteroid belt with immense liquid water oceans beneath their surfaces.
Titan's interior ocean may have more than 10 times as much liquid water as all of the Earth's rivers, lakes, seas and oceans combined.
And at Titan, there are also exotic lakes and seas of liquid methane and ethane on the surface.
Ocean worlds are some of the most fascinating places in the solar system, and we have only just begun to explore them.
This is Dragonfly.
At the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, we're building this mission for NASA's new Frontiers program.
Scheduled to launch in 2026 and reach Titan in 2034, Dragonfly is a rotorcraft lander, similar in size to the Mars rovers or about the size of a small car.
Titan's dense atmosphere, combined with its low gravity, make it a great place to fly, and that's exactly what Dragonfly is designed to do.
Technically an octocopter, Dragonfly is a mobile laboratory that can fly from place to place taking all of its scientific instruments with it.
Dragonfly will investigate Titan in a truly unique way, studying details of its weather and geology, and even picking up samples from the surface to learn what they're made of.
All told, Dragonfly will spend about three years exploring Titan, measuring its detailed chemistry, observing the atmosphere and how it interacts with the surface, and even listening for earthquakes, or technically titanquakes, in Titan's crust.
The Dragonfly team, hundreds of people across North America and around the world, is hard at work on the design for this mission, developing the rotorcraft, its autonomous navigation system and its instrumentation, all of which will need to work together to make science measurements on the surface of Titan.
Dragonfly is the next step in our exploration of this fascinating natural laboratory.
In flying by, Voyager hinted at the possibilities.
In orbiting Saturn for over a decade and descending through Titan's atmosphere, Cassini and Huygens pulled Titan's veil back a bit further.
Dragonfly will live in the Titan environment, where, so far, our only close-up view is this image the Huygens probe took in January 2005. In many ways, Titan is the closest known analogue we have to the early Earth, the Earth before life developed here.
Habitability is a fascinating concept.
What's necessary to make an environment suitable to host life, whether life as we know it here on Earth, or perhaps exotic life that has developed under very different conditions?
The possibility of life elsewhere has inspired human imagination and exploration throughout history.
On a grand scale, it's why the ocean worlds in the outer solar system have become such important targets for study.
It's the "what if" that drives human exploration.
We don't know how chemistry took the step to biology here on Earth, but similar chemical processes may have happened on Titan, where organic molecules have had the opportunity to mix with liquid water at the surface.
Has organic synthesis progressed under these conditions?
And if so, how far?
We don't know . . . yet. What we will learn from Dragonfly, this fundamentally human endeavor, is tantalizing.
It's a search for building blocks, foundations, chemical steps like those that ultimately led to life on Earth.
We're not sure exactly what we will find when we get to Titan, but that's exactly why we're going.
In 1994, Carl Sagan wrote, "On Titan, the molecules that have been raining down like manna from heaven for the last four billion years might still be there, largely unaltered, deep-frozen, awaiting the chemists from Earth.
This is Titan.
In August 1981, Voyager 2 captured this image of Saturn's largest moon.
Shrouded by the obscuring haze, Titan's surface was a huge, outstanding mystery that Cassini-Huygens, an orbiter lander pair launched in 1997, was designed to solve.

It's a search for building blocks, foundations, chemical steps like those that ultimately led to life on Earth.
We're not sure exactly what we will find when we get to Titan, but that's exactly why we're going.
" We are those chemists.
I have a confession to make, right off the bat.
I was also waiting for an invitation to the Jedi Temple or a tap on the shoulder to invite me to the X-Men.
In medicine, intersex babies who are born with ambiguous genitalia are routinely operated on without consent, without medical need, irreversibly, in order to make their healthy anatomy appear more "normal.
" This is before they've even said their first words, indicated a sexuality or a gender identity.
Many people are never told the truth about their intersex traits, and those who are are instructed, often, not to tell anyone.
Secrecy is enforced and shame is a close shadow.
In the law, intersex people fall outside of categorization, and more importantly, protection.
This concerns the banal tasks -- if you can imagine the number of forms you've filled out that you had to check "M" of "F" on -- to lacking protection under any law, specifically, the Gender Recognition or Equality Act.
And intersex people cannot correct the sex classification they've been given at birth unless they declare they are transgender.
After decades of activism, these life-altering problems are starting to be addressed.
So why does this matter to those of you who aren't intersex, who don't have variations of sex characteristics?
I imagine many people in this audience have, in the privacy of their own bathrooms, wondered . . . "Are my labia too long?
" "Are my testicles uneven?
" "Is my penis too small?
" "Is my vagina too wide or too shallow? " Nothing that hurts or gets in the way, just aesthetically: "Are mine 'normal?
'" I imagine that many people in this audience have those small concerns but generally go about their lives not thinking about it.
(Laughter) What if they went so far as to assign you a different sex based off these measurements . . . And then they lied to you about what they'd done?
What if these surgeries sterilized you?
What if they resulted in immense pain and scarring?
What if you had to take medicine for the rest of your life to replace the healthy organs they took away, and you had to pay for that medicine yourself?
And then every time you went to a doctor's office for a cold, you were questioned about your sex life, your gender identity, what your private parts looked like.
And then more doctors and medical students were invited to add to these questions, ask you to drop your trousers or submit to an unnecessary medical exam.
This is a picture of what is happening to the intersex community -- people like me, every day, around the world.
Our community is not antimedicine or antisurgery.
We are for the right to make decisions about our bodies and our lives.
The current approach to intersex people stems from a now-debunked academic study from a man who, over 50 years ago, believed that you could raise a child in any gender by changing their genitals, never telling them and reinforcing that gender over and over again.
It also stems from referring to healthy intersex variations as abnormal or disordered. This makes sense.
If you refer to something as a disorder, it suggests there's a fix.
It also stems [from] the fear and stigma of being intersex, from homophobia, transphobia, sexism and ultimately, our colonial past.
I am not here to say that the categories of men and women don't exist.
I'm saying, like most things in this world, it is more complicated than that.
The world is complex, and we can choose to see that as beautiful, or we can choose to continue to deny the existence of that complexity, push people into artificial, binary boxes, fix what isn't broken and restrict our own field of vision.
One of the challenges that intersex people face today is making ourselves visible and making ourselves safe at the same time.
By that, I mean we are appealing to the humanity of lawmakers to make us safe whilst putting ourselves into the public eye, sharing our stories, trying to build community with people like us . . . Even when it isn't safe to do so.
No life is free of issue.
I have watched other women pass me in the street and imagine the ways that they were more woman than me, more human than me.
On the other, I have been deeply loved for everything that I am, in friendship and romantically.
I have taken the time to love my body and not judge the bodies of others.
Simply trying to erase variation, difference, builds shame.
Intersex people who fall outside of this false sex binary have always existed, throughout human history.
When we find out we are intersex, some of us believe we are the only ones in the world.
Me, specifically, I have XY chromosomes, which you may have understood to be typically male.
I was also born with gonads instead of ovaries.
Standing here on this stage would have been my worst nightmare only five years ago.
It would have been impossible.
I use the metaphor of the superhuman, but really, we are just like you.
Intersex people are thought to make up to 1.7 percent of the population.
That means more, depending on where you are in the world, but you get the picture.
We are in front of you, getting coffee; we are sitting next to you on the train; we are swiping you left and right on dating apps -- (Laughter) So why haven't you heard of us?
If we are so common, why don't you see us?
How has the world responded to us?
We often think of disciplines like medicine and the law as supposedly neutral -- immune to bias.
The law is "reason free from passion.
" The doctors' Hippocratic oath states that "warmth, sympathy and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's pill.
" In truth, these disciplines that touch our lives are impressive, but they are filled with our prejudices.
They are not immune, just as we are not immune to the effects of that prejudice, which can be devastating.
In medicine, intersex babies who are born with ambiguous genitalia are routinely operated on without consent, without medical need, irreversibly, in order to make their healthy anatomy appear more "normal.
" This is before they've even said their first words, indicated a sexuality or a gender identity.
Many people are never told the truth about their intersex traits, and those who are are instructed, often, not to tell anyone.
Secrecy is enforced and shame is a close shadow.
In the law, intersex people fall outside of categorization, and more importantly, protection.
This concerns the banal tasks -- if you can imagine the number of forms you've filled out that you had to check "M" of "F" on -- to lacking protection under any law, specifically, the Gender Recognition or Equality Act.
And intersex people cannot correct the sex classification they've been given at birth unless they declare they are transgender.
After decades of activism, these life-altering problems are starting to be addressed.
So why does this matter to those of you who aren't intersex, who don't have variations of sex characteristics?
I imagine many people in this audience have, in the privacy of their own bathrooms, wondered . . . "Are my labia too long?
" "Are my testicles uneven?
" "Is my penis too small?
" "Is my vagina too wide or too shallow? " Nothing that hurts or gets in the way, just aesthetically: "Are mine 'normal?
'" I imagine that many people in this audience have those small concerns but generally go about their lives not thinking about it.
(Laughter) What if they went so far as to assign you a different sex based off these measurements . . . And then they lied to you about what they'd done?
What if these surgeries sterilized you?
What if they resulted in immense pain and scarring?
What if you had to take medicine for the rest of your life to replace the healthy organs they took away, and you had to pay for that medicine yourself?
And then every time you went to a doctor's office for a cold, you were questioned about your sex life, your gender identity, what your private parts looked like.
Our community is not antimedicine or antisurgery.
We are for the right to make decisions about our bodies and our lives.
It also stems from referring to healthy intersex variations as abnormal or disordered. This makes sense.
If you refer to something as a disorder, it suggests there's a fix.
It also stems [from] the fear and stigma of being intersex, from homophobia, transphobia, sexism and ultimately, our colonial past.
I'm saying, like most things in this world, it is more complicated than that.
The world is complex, and we can choose to see that as beautiful, or we can choose to continue to deny the existence of that complexity, push people into artificial, binary boxes, fix what isn't broken and restrict our own field of vision.
I have watched other women pass me in the street and imagine the ways that they were more woman than me, more human than me.
I have taken the time to love my body and not judge the bodies of others.
This is why it is in our interest to protect intersex people and make them visible.
For as long as societies reinforce one form of acceptable, of "normal," everyone will face insecurity for being different in any way.
Simply trying to erase variation, difference, builds shame.
Kanzi’s exploits ignited immediate controversy over one question: had Kanzi learned language?
What we call language is something more specific than communication.
Language is about sharing what’s in our minds: stories, opinions, questions, the past or future, imagined times or places, ideas.
It is fundamentally open-ended, and can be used to say an unlimited number of things.
Many researchers are convinced that only humans have language, that the calls and gestures other species use to communicate are not language.
Each of these calls and gestures generally corresponds to a specific message, for a limited total number of messages that aren’t combined into more complex ideas.
For example, a monkey species might have a specific warning call that corresponds to a particular predator, like a snake— but with language, there are countless ways to say “watch out for the snake.
” So far no animal communication seems to have the open-endedness of human language.
We don’t know for sure what’s going on in animals’ heads, and it's possible this definition of language, or our ways of measuring it, don’t apply to them.
But as far as we know, only humans have language.
And while humans speak around 7,000 distinct languages, any child can learn any language, indicating that the biological machinery underlying language is common to all of us.
So what does language mean for humanity?
What does it allow us to do, and how did we come to have it?
Exactly when we acquired this capacity is still an open question.
Chimps and bonobos are our closest living relatives, but the lineage leading to humans split from the other great apes more than four million years ago.
In between, there were many species— all of them now extinct, which makes it very difficult to know if they had language or anything like it.
Great apes give one potential clue to the origins of language, though: it may have started as gesture rather than speech.
Great apes gesture to each other in the wild much more freely than they vocalize.
Language may have begun to take shape during the Pleistocene, 2 to 3 million years ago, with the emergence of the genus Homo that eventually gave rise to our own species, homo sapiens.
Brain size tripled, and bipedalism freed the hands for communication.
There may have been a transition from gestural communication to gestural language— from pointing to objects and pantomiming actions— to more efficient, abstract signing.
The abstraction of gestural communication would have removed the need for visuals, setting the stage for a transition to spoken language.
That transition would have likely come later, though.
Articulate speech depends on a vocal tract of a particular shape.
Even our closest ancestors, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, had vocal tracts that were not optimal, though they likely had some vocal capacity, and possibly even language.
Only in humans is the vocal tract optimal.
Spoken words free the hands for activities such as tool use and transport.
So it may have been the emergence of speech, not of language itself, that led to the dominance of our species.
Language is so intimately tied to complex thought, perception, and motor functions that it’s difficult to untangle its biological origins.
Some of the biggest mysteries remain: to what extent did language as a capacity shape humanity, and to what extent did humanity shape language?
What came first, the vast number of possible scenarios we can envisage, or our ability to share them?In the 1980s, a bonobo named Kanzi learned to communicate with humans to an unprecedented extent— not through speech or gestures, but using a keyboard of abstract symbols representing objects and actions.
By pointing to several of these in order, he created sequences to make requests, answer verbal questions from human researchers, and refer to objects that weren’t physically present.

I listen to this music and I'm like, I don't want to have to turn up to the sound of my own oppression.
You know, music is one of the most powerful forms of communication, because it has the potential to either uplift or oppress. Music caters to the emotions.
Music caters to the soul.
Music opens up our soul.
It opens up our channels to receive information about somebody else's walk of life, to inform our own roles.
And while I have no problem with male fantasy, what I do have a problem with is that, according to a recent study, only 2.6 percent of all music producers identify as women. That means an even smaller percentage identify as trans or gender nonconforming.
And why does this matter?
Because, if we don't own and control our own narrative, somebody else will tell our stories for us, and they will get it wrong, perpetuating the very myths that hold us back.
And I'm not here to tell other people how to make their music. But I am here to provide and design the alternative.
One strategy I take in my music is making uplifting, energetic, percussive global beats and placing lyrics on top of them that genuinely describe my life's experiences without contributing to the oppression of anybody else.
It's funny, because it's the same reason as to why we excuse so many problematic lyrics; it's because we love how the beats make us feel.
An example of this is my song "Top Knot Turn Up.
It's a top knot turn up It's a top knot turn up, turn up, turn up.
It's a top knot turn up It's a top knot turn up, eyyy.
It's a top knot turn up.
(Music ends) I want us to keep making sex-positive, beautiful music about joy and freedom.
I want us to embrace our own pleasure just as much as we embrace our own pain.
I want us to celebrate the authentic, nuanced, multidimensional aspects of our human existence, rather than perform false narratives of degrading sexuality in order to feel accepted or loved.
And another strategy that I take in my music to combat the misogyny that exists on the airwaves is to visually depict the very world I wished we lived in.
In the music video for my song "See Me Thru," which is like a vibe-y, queer electronic R and B song, I cast two of my dear friends, Ania and Dejha, to play the role of the lovers, because they're married in real life.
But what you don't know is that they also are behind the camera concepting and directing the entire video.
(Video) Heyyyyy ohhhh My emotions were tired Music should be safe and accessible for all to experience.
As you can see, it's not about losing the sex appeal or swag that music has, it's about writing messages that infuse tenderness and positivity into music that motivates us and challenges us.
And while we as musicians absolutely have the responsibility to make music that isn't disempowering, the consumers can be part of the change, too.
Firstly, we get to choose which songs we want to mute and which songs we want to turn louder. We get to say, "I respect myself enough to say I don't want to listen to this, and I don't want this to be in anybody else's space, either.
" Secondly, we can simply ask ourselves: "Does this music or this message contribute to the oppression of somebody else?
Why am I tolerating it?
" And finally, we can all be choosing to make playlists or DJ-ing music that provides the right vibe or mood that we're looking for in that moment without the problematic messaging. Why does this matter?
Because it's teaching algorithms in our streaming systems and our world exactly what it is that we do want to listen to, creating long-term change and a feedbacking mechanism that impacts the entire industry.
This is not a message for just a small group of people.

This is a message that affects everybody, because when we protect and liberate our most vulnerable genders, we liberate everybody.
So data and analytics are dramatically changing our everyday lives.
Not just online, not just in some distant future, but in the physical world, and in very real and tangible ways.
I spent the past 11 years of my life as a geek at MIT, working in big data labs that seek to use data science to study the physical world and try to solve society's great problems.
The field of big data seeks to analyze massive pools of data using computational tools to find patterns and trends.
Data can be a really extraordinary storyteller, unveiling the hidden narratives of things in our everyday lives that we never would have seen. I find the personal stories of inanimate things brought to life to be extraordinarily compelling.
I want to highlight, first, two projects from my time at MIT that I think highlight this phenomenon really well.
The first is called Trash Track, and in this project, we sought to better understand the waste-management system, to answer the question "Where does your trash go when you throw it away?
" Your old coffee cup or that flip phone that you carried around in the early 2000s, or a bagel or this morning's paper -- where do these things go?
This data didn't exist, so we had to create it.
We answered and then visualized this question by installing small sensors into pieces of trash and then throwing them into the waste system.
And it's important to visualize this data, because none of you are, probably, sitting here thinking, "Yeah, that looks right.
" Because, no -- (Laughter) What the data shows us is a highly inefficient system whose inherent brokenness I don't think we really would have seen had the sensors not done the journalism for us.
A second project that I'd have to highlight has to do with creating robots that dive into sewers and sample wastewater.
I know that sewage kind of gets a bad rap, but it's actually kind of awesome, because it can tell us an incredible amount about the health of our communities.
This technology was spun out by a group call Biobot Analytics, who's creating a cutting-edge technology to turn our sewers into modern-day health observatories.
Their goal is to study opioids within the sewage to better understand consumption in cities.
And this data is key, because it really helps cities understand where people are using, how to allocate resources and the effectiveness of programming over time.
Once again, the technology that's built into this machine is pulling back the curtain and showing us something about our cities that we never would have seen without it.
So it turns out, as we see, that big data is really everywhere -- even in your toilet.
And so now that we've talked about trash and sewage, let's move on . . . to food.
(Laughter) A year ago, I left MIT to pursue a passion in food, and in 2017, started a company with my husband, called Family Dinner.
The goal of our company is to create community around local food and the people who grow it.
Which brings us to a critical question: Why exactly would someone leave a very promising career at one of the top urban science labs in the world to drive carrots around in her mom's Acura? (Laughter) It's a great car.
The current national food system is optimized for one thing only, and that's corporate profit, right?
And think about that.
The most compelling reason for food companies to exist is not to feed hungry people, it's not to make delicious-tasting food.
It's profit.
The antibiotics and pesticides that are being put into our food are detrimental to our health. Price pressure is forcing small farms out of business.
In fact, a lot of the things that you think about farms no longer exist.
We know that it happens in transit, at the warehouses, in the grocery stores.
And finally, on our own kitchen counters, when we determine that that spotty, brown banana no longer looks so yummy.
All that waste, all that effort.
Food is planted, grown, harvested, shipped, and then just thrown away.
How do we make a better system?
This, we believe, is the better system.
We'll talk about them one by one.
This is tomato number one. This is the guy that you'll find in sub shops, supermarkets and fast-food joints around the world.
It's got a really long and complicated backstory.
But the difference is dramatic.
The taste and the flavor are incomparable.
" The ones that many of you visit and the ones that I really enjoy.
And there's another option.
This also has a couple issues.
This lets farmers know how much to harvest in the near-term, but also what to plant going forward.
It also allows us to look into the future with the farmers and do crop planning.
So if we can say to them, in June of this year, "I'm going to need 400 pounds of asparagus and 500 pounds of berries every week," they can plant that accordingly, knowing with confidence that they will sell everything that they have grown.
And finally, we use a route-optimization software to help us solve the problem of the traveling salesman. We get a fleet of workers to come in and help us go the last mile, bringing all these goodies directly to your door.
And lastly, taste.
And what you're seeing here is the data.
" (Laughter) "That's working like it should, right?
" Because, no -- (Laughter) What the data shows us is a highly inefficient system whose inherent brokenness I don't think we really would have seen had the sensors not done the journalism for us.
A second project that I'd have to highlight has to do with creating robots that dive into sewers and sample wastewater.

Which brings us to a critical question: Why exactly would someone leave a very promising career at one of the top urban science labs in the world to drive carrots around in her mom's Acura? (Laughter) It's a great car.
Because I believe that the story of local food needs to be understood, told and elevated, and in many ways, I think that nerds like us are really uniquely poised to tell it. So where are we starting?
It's profit.
Farms don't look like farms, they look like factories.
Well, we know that it happens in the field when you don't pick the sexiest-looking potatoes.
We know that it happens in transit, at the warehouses, in the grocery stores.
And finally, on our own kitchen counters, when we determine that that spotty, brown banana no longer looks so yummy.
All that waste, all that effort.
Food is planted, grown, harvested, shipped, and then just thrown away.
We think that there has to be a better way.
And so how to we improve upon this?
How do we make a better system?
In order to do this, we understand that we need to eliminate waste in the food supply chain.
We need to get data in the hands of farmers, so that they can make better predictions.
So they can, you know, kind of compete with the big guy. And then finally, we need to prize, as a company, quality and taste above everything, so that people really value the delicious food on their plates.
This, we believe, is the better system.
This is the better way.
And the path to that better way is paved with data.
To highlight all of this, I want to tell the tale of two tomatoes.
We'll talk about them one by one.
It's very exciting.
This is tomato number one. This is the guy that you'll find in sub shops, supermarkets and fast-food joints around the world.
It's got a really long and complicated backstory.
It's been treated with a cocktail of, like, a dozen pesticides and it has traveled at least 1,600 miles to get to your house.
And the image here is green, because these tomatoes are picked when green and hard as a rock, and then they are gassed along the way so that when they arrive at the destination, they look bright and shiny and red and ripe.
All of that effort, all of that agricultural innovation and technology to create a product that is entirely without taste.
And onto the second tomato in our tale. This is the local version of the fruit.
Its story is much, much shorter.
This guy was grown by Luke Mahoney and his family at Brookford Farm in Canterbury, New Hampshire.
It's got a pretty boring backstory.
It was planted, sat in the sun and then it was picked.
(Laughter) That's it.
Like, you wouldn't want to -- yeah, there's not much more to that.
And it traveled maybe 70 miles to get your plate.
But the difference is dramatic.
I want you think about the last time you ate a fresh, summer tomato.
And I know we're all covered in our jackets, but think about it.
The last time you ate a tomato from the garden.
It's warm from the sun, it's richly red, maybe it smells like dirt.
There's something nostalgic and almost magical in that experience.
The taste and the flavor are incomparable.
And we really don't have to travel super far to get it.
Now this story extends up the food chain, from the fruits and the vegetables that are on our plate to the animals and the animal products that we consume.
What goes into raising them, and more importantly, what doesn't go into raising them, is critically important.
Luke and his family have 60 cows.
They use traditional methods. They do it the old way: pasture-raised, no hormones, no antibiotics, hay for days.
And what they're doing here is just treating cows like they're cows, not like they're in a science experiment. He's raising animals the way that his grandfather and his grandfather would have. And at the end, it's just better.
It's better for the animals; it's better for the environment.
Luke is not optimizing for profit or price, but for taste and for humanity.
And what you're thinking is, "There's already a solution to this.
It's the farmer's markets.
" The ones that many of you visit and the ones that I really enjoy.
They are a wonderful, but, in many ways, suboptimal solution.
For us as the consumers, it's kind of great, right?
You go, there's this beautiful bounty of food, you get the warm and fuzzies for supporting a local farm and you get the experience of trying something new and trying diverse products.
And inevitably, there's some guy playing the ukulele somewhere in the background.
(Laughter) But for the farmers, this presents a lot of risk, right?
You wake up at four.
You pack your truck, you hire a team, you get to your stall, but you have no guarantees that you're going to move your product that day. There's too many variables in New England.
For example, the weather, which is just, like, a little bit unpredictable here.
The weather is one of the many X factors that determine whether or not a market will be worth it for the farmers. Every time, they roll the dice.
And there's another option.
Here, we're talking about CSAs: community-supported agriculture. In this model, customers pay up front, bearing the financial risk for the farms.
Farmers grow what they can and the customers enjoy that bounty.
This also has a couple issues.
I still don't know.
So back to the question.
How do we fix this?
What we're hoping to do and what we're hoping to build is just a better way to CSA. And there are three core innovations that make this thing hum.
The first of which is a subscription-based e-commerce platform, which helps us create a consistent demand for our farmers throughout the year.
The subscription part here is key. Orders process weekly, customers opt out instead of opt in -- that means we've got kind of the same number of orders week to week.
Second, this means that if farmers can sell online, they're no longer limited to the geography directly around their farm or to the number of markets that they can sell.
We've blown the doors off of that for them.
Second: demand forecasting. We're using analytics to allow ourselves to look into the future and forecast demand.
This lets farmers know how much to harvest in the near-term, but also what to plant going forward.
If 200 orders process on Monday, then we buy to meet that exact demand.
200 heads of broccoli, 200 pieces of salmon, et cetera, et cetera.
This automation in ordering means that here, we are eliminating the waste in the food system that bothers us all so much, because we are ensuring that the supply meets the exact demand.
It also allows us to look into the future with the farmers and do crop planning.
So if we can say to them, in June of this year, "I'm going to need 400 pounds of asparagus and 500 pounds of berries every week," they can plant that accordingly, knowing with confidence that they will sell everything that they have grown.
And finally, we use a route-optimization software to help us solve the problem of the traveling salesman. We get a fleet of workers to come in and help us go the last mile, bringing all these goodies directly to your door.
Without data science and a super-capable, wonderful team, none of this would be possible. So maybe you've seen that we've got some sort of fiery, passionate core beliefs.
Yes, we're trying to build a sustainable business, but our eye is not only on profit, it's on building a better, holistic system of food.
And here's what we value. People first.
We're trying to build community around food, the people who love it and the people who grow it.
We built this company to support small farms.
Zero waste.
We all hate wasting food, it just feels wrong -- even that weirdo banana that's been sitting around on your coffee table for too long.
And lastly, taste.
If it doesn't taste good, if it's not that, like, perfect summer tomato, why bother?
So what we've done is worked with all these local farms to bring their things in and then to drop them directly at your door, so that we're connecting you right to them and making, again, a more holistic system.
This is our vision of the future.
To extend this model beyond Boston, beyond New England and across the country.
To create a nationwide distributed network of local farms and to connect all these farmers with the people like you who will love their food.
We believe, at the end of the day, that really insisting on eating local food is a revolutionary act.
And we invite you to join us.
And who knows?
You may even make some friends along the way.
Often when we're sick typically what we want to do is just curl up in bed and go to sleep.
And in part what we're trying to do is sleep ourselves well, because there's a very intimate association between our sleep health and our immune health.
[Sleeping with Science] We know that individuals reporting less than seven hours of sleep a night are almost three times more likely to become infected by the rhinovirus, otherwise known as the common cold.
We also know that women sleeping five hours or less a night are almost 70 percent more likely to develop pneumonia.
Well we've also discovered that sleep can play a role in your successful immunization.
So in one study, they took a group of individuals and they limited them to four hours of sleep a night for six nights.
And in the other group, they gave them a full night of sleep each and every one of those nights.
And then during that time period, they gave them a flu shot and they measured the response to that flu shot.
What they discovered is that in those individuals who were sleeping just four hours a night, they went on to produce less than 50 percent of the normal antibody response.
So in other words, if you're not getting sufficient sleep in the week or the days before you get your flu shot, it may render that vaccination far less effective as a consequence.
What this tells us, and now what we're starting to learn, is that it's during sleep at night, including deep non-REM sleep, when we actually restock the weaponry within our immune arsenal.
We actually stimulate the production of numerous different immune factors.
And furthermore, the body actually increases its sensitivity to those immune factors.
So you wake up the next day as a more robust immune individual.
So when it comes to your immune system, you should perhaps think of sleep as one of the best health insurance policies that you could ever wish for.Often when we're sick typically what we want to do is just curl up in bed and go to sleep.

"I've got people in me." So sang the late Abbey Lincoln. I take that lyric as mantra. "I've got people in me. " Jomama Jones is the person in me I turn to as a guide.
She's my alter ego. I've been embodying her in performance since 1995, and she comes around when she has some insight to offer folks. At this time of radical change, I'm glad to be the vessel for her message to you.
What if I told you there are trials ahead beyond your deepest fears?
But what if I told you that is as it must be?
What if I told you I've seen the future?
And I'm still here illegally.
When I was 12, my mother sent me to live with her parents, my grandparents, or, as we say in Tagalog, lolo and lola. Lolo's name was Teofilo.
So, where did you come from?
How did you get here?
Who paid?
All across America, in front of diverse audiences -- conservatives and progressives, high school students and senior citizens -- I've asked those questions.
As a person of color, I always get asked where I'm from, as in, "Where are you from from?
" So I've asked white people where they're from from, too.
After asking a student at the University of Georgia where he was from, he said, "I'm American. " "I know," I said, "but where are you from?
" "I'm white," he replied.
"But white is not a country," I said.
"Where are your ancestors from?
" When he replied with a shrug, I said, "Well, where did you come from?
How did you get here?
Who paid?
" He couldn't answer.
I don't think you can talk about America as America without answering those three core questions.
Immigration is America's lifeline, how this country has replenished itself for centuries, from the settlers and the revolutionaries who populated the original 13 colonies to the millions of immigrants, predominantly from Europe, who relentlessly colonized this land.
I could go on and on here, but my point, my larger point, is this: How much do any of us, whether immigrants of the past or the present, know of these crucial parts of American history?
How much of this history makes up the actual US citizenship test?
Have you ever seen it?
It's a mostly oral test, and government officers ask applicants up to 10 of the 100 questions.
To pass, applicants must get at least six answers right.
I looked at the test recently, and I was aghast at the questions posed and what constitutes acceptable answers to the glaring omissions.
There's a question about the Statue of Liberty and where it is.
There's no question about Ellis Island, about the United States as an immigrant nation and the countless anti-immigrant laws that were passed.
There's nothing about Native American history.
There's a question about what Martin Luther King, Jr. did, but largely, there's inadequate and irresponsible contexts about African Americans.
Here's an example.
Question number 74 under the American history section asks applicants to "name one problem that led to the Civil War.
" There are three acceptable answers: slavery, states' rights, economic reasons.
Did my Lola and Lolo get that question?
If they did get the question, do they even understand the history behind it?
How about my uncles and aunties and cousins and millions of other immigrants who had to take that test to become Americans?
What do immigrants know about America before we get here?
What kind of citizenship are we applying for?
And is that the same kind of citizenship we actually want to be a part of?
Come to think of it -- I've been thinking a lot about this -- what does dignified citizenship look like?
How can I ask for it when I just arrived here 26 years ago, when Black and Native people who have been here in America for hundreds of years are still waiting for theirs?
One of my favorite writers is Toni Morrison. In 1996, a year before I found out I was in the country illegally, my eighth-grade class was assigned to read "The Bluest Eye," Morrison's first book.
Instantly, the book challenged me to ask hard questions.
Why does Pecola Breedlove, this young Black girl at the center of the book, why did she want blue eyes?
Who told her to want it?
Why did she believe them?
Morrison said she wrote the book to illustrate what happens when a person surrenders to what she called "the master narrative.
" "Definitions," Morrison said, "belong to the definers, not the defined.
" Once I realized that I was here illegally, I convinced myself that if I was not a legal citizen by birth or by law, another kind of citizenship was possible.
Citizenship as participation: I engage.
I engage with all kinds of Americans, even Americans who don't want me here.
Citizenship as contribution: I give back to my community in whatever ways I can.
As an undocumented entrepreneur -- and yes, there is such a thing -- I've employed many US citizens.
Citizenship as education: We can't wait for others to educate us about the past and how we got to this present.
We have to educate ourselves and our circles.
Citizenship as something greater than myself: We are, I think, individually and collectively, rewriting the master narrative of America.
The people who were once defined are now doing the defining.
They're asking the questions that need to be asked.
A core part of that redefinition is how we define not only who is an American but what constitutes citizenship.
Which, to me, is our responsibility to each other.
So consider your own personal narrative and ask yourself: Where did you come from?
How did you get here?
Who paid?
In 2009, two researchers ran a simple experiment.
They took everything we know about our solar system and calculated where every planet would be up to 5 billion years in the future.
To do so they ran over 2,000 numerical simulations with the same exact initial conditions except for one difference: the distance between Mercury and the Sun, modified by less than a millimeter from one simulation to the next.
Shockingly, in about 1 percent of their simulations, Mercury’s orbit changed so drastically that it could plunge into the Sun or collide with Venus.
Worse yet, in one simulation it destabilized the entire inner solar system.
This was no error; the astonishing variety in results reveals the truth that our solar system may be much less stable than it seems.
Astrophysicists refer to this astonishing property of gravitational systems as the n-body problem.
While we have equations that can completely predict the motions of two gravitating masses, our analytical tools fall short when faced with more populated systems.
It’s actually impossible to write down all the terms of a general formula that can exactly describe the motion of three or more gravitating objects.
Why?
The issue lies in how many unknown variables an n-body system contains.
Thanks to Isaac Newton, we can write a set of equations to describe the gravitational force acting between bodies.
However, when trying to find a general solution for the unknown variables in these equations, we’re faced with a mathematical constraint: for each unknown, there must be at least one equation that independently describes it.
Initially, a two-body system appears to have more unknown variables for position and velocity than equations of motion.
However, there’s a trick: consider the relative position and velocity of the two bodies with respect to the center of gravity of the system. This reduces the number of unknowns and leaves us with a solvable system.
With three or more orbiting objects in the picture, everything gets messier.
Even with the same mathematical trick of considering relative motions, we’re left with more unknowns than equations describing them.
There are simply too many variables for this system of equations to be untangled into a general solution.
But what does it actually look like for objects in our universe to move according to analytically unsolvable equations of motion?
A system of three stars— like Alpha Centauri— could come crashing into one another or, more likely, some might get flung out of orbit after a long time of apparent stability.
Other than a few highly improbable stable configurations, almost every possible case is unpredictable on long timescales. Each has an astronomically large range of potential outcomes, dependent on the tiniest of differences in position and velocity.
This behaviour is known as chaotic by physicists, and is an important characteristic of n-body systems.
Such a system is still deterministic— meaning there’s nothing random about it.
If multiple systems start from the exact same conditions, they’ll always reach the same result.
But give one a little shove at the start, and all bets are off.
That’s clearly relevant for human space missions, when complicated orbits need to be calculated with great precision.
Thankfully, continuous advancements in computer simulations offer a number of ways to avoid catastrophe.
By approximating the solutions with increasingly powerful processors, we can more confidently predict the motion of n-body systems on long time-scales.
And if one body in a group of three is so light it exerts no significant force on the other two, the system behaves, with very good approximation, as a two-body system.
This approach is known as the “restricted three-body problem.
” It proves extremely useful in describing, for example, an asteroid in the Earth-Sun gravitational field, or a small planet in the field of a black hole and a star.
As for our solar system, you’ll be happy to hear that we can have reasonable confidence in its stability for at least the next several hundred million years.
Though if another star, launched from across the galaxy, is on its way to us, all bets are off.In 2009, two researchers ran a simple experiment.

You know, a lot of people really struggle to give themselves permission to be creative.
" And he said, "That's my job.
And so, I find that very liberating, because I think that most of us really want to offer the world something of quality, something that the world will consider good or important.
And that's really the enemy, because it's not up to us whether what we do is any good, and if history has taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic.
Right?
What is happening to me?
We look at the, oh . . . the aurora borealis.
Right?
Your lover's pretty beautiful.
And first we have to survive, and then we have to thrive.
For me, it was really easy.
Five pages on doing these costumes.
I remember my stepbrother and I went to go see "Top Gun," whatever year that came out.
I just want to be a part of that.
He's a multidecorated combat veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq.
They're not building a sandcastle going, "I think I'm going to be a really good sandcastle builder.
There's no path till you walk it, and you have to be willing to play the fool.
So don't read the book that you should read, read the book you want to read.
Don't listen to the music that you used to like.
Take some time to listen to some new music.
Take some time to talk to somebody that you don't normally talk to.
I guarantee, if you do that, you will feel foolish.
That's the point.
Play the fool.
(Plays guitar) (Sings) Well, I want to go Austin, and I wanna stay home.
Invite our friends over but still be alone.
Live for danger.
Play it cool.
Have everyone respect me for being a fool.I was hoping today to talk a little bit about creativity.
You know, a lot of people really struggle to give themselves permission to be creative.
And reasonably so.
I mean, we're all a little suspect of our own talent.
And I remember a story I came across in my early 20s that kind of meant a lot to me.
And he got back to New York to all his intelligentsia friends, and they all told him, "Don't you know that everybody thinks you're an idiot, and the whole country's making fun of you?
" And he said, "That's my job.
I'm a poet, and I'm going to play the fool.
Most people have to go to work all day long, and they come home and they fight with their spouse, and they eat, and they turn on the old boob tube, and somebody tries to sell them something, and I just screwed all that up.
I went on and I sang about Krishna, and now they're sitting in bed and going, 'Who is this stupid poet?
' And they can't fall asleep, right?
" And that's his job as a poet.
And so, I find that very liberating, because I think that most of us really want to offer the world something of quality, something that the world will consider good or important.
And that's really the enemy, because it's not up to us whether what we do is any good, and if history has taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic.
Right?
So you have to ask yourself: Do you think human creativity matters?
Well, hmm.
Most people don't spend a lot of time thinking about poetry.
Right?
How did they come out of this cloud?
" Or the inverse -- something great.
You meet somebody and your heart explodes.
You love them so much, you can't even see straight.
You know, you're dizzy.
"Did anybody feel like this before?
What is happening to me?
Human creativity is nature manifest in us.
We look at the, oh . . . the aurora borealis.
Right?
I did this movie called "White Fang" when I was a kid, and we shot up in Alaska, and you go out at night and the sky was like rippling with purple and pink and white, and it's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It really looked like the sky was playing. Beautiful. You go to Grand Canyon at sundown.
It's beautiful.
We know that's beautiful.
But fall in love?
Your lover's pretty beautiful.
I have four kids.
Watching them play?
Watching them pretend to be a butterfly or run around the house and doing anything, it's so beautiful.
And I believe that we are here on this star in space to try to help one another. Right?
And first we have to survive, and then we have to thrive.
And to thrive, to express ourselves, alright, well, here's the rub: we have to know ourselves.
What do you love?
And if you get close to what you love, who you are is revealed to you, and it expands.
For me, it was really easy.
I did my first professional play.
I was 12 years old.
I was in a play called "Saint Joan" by George Bernard Shaw at the McCarter Theatre, and -- boom!
-- I was in love.
My world just expanded.
And that profession -- I'm almost 50 now -- that profession has never stopped giving back to me, and it gives back more and more, mostly, strangely, through the characters that I've played.
I've played cops, I've played criminals, I've played priests, I've played sinners, and the magic of this over a lifetime, over 30 years of doing this, is that you start to see that my experiences, me, Ethan, is not nearly as unique as I thought.
I have so much in common with all these people.
And so they have something in common with me.
You start to see how connected we all are.
My great-grandmother, Della Hall Walker Green, on her deathbed, she wrote this little biography in the hospital, and it was only about 36 pages long, and she spent about five pages on the one time she did costumes for a play.
Her first husband got, like, a paragraph.
Cotton farming, of which she did for 50 years, gets a mention.
Five pages on doing these costumes.
And I look -- my mom gave me one of her quilts that she made, and you can feel it.
She was expressing herself, and it has a power that's real.
I remember my stepbrother and I went to go see "Top Gun," whatever year that came out.
And I remember we walked out of the mall, it was, like, blazing hot, I just looked at him, and we both felt that movie just like a calling from God.
You know?
Just . . . But completely differently.
Like, I wanted to be an actor.
I was like, I've got to make something that makes people feel.
I just want to be a part of that.
And he wanted to be in the military.
That's all we ever did was play FBI, play army man, play knights, you know, and I'd like, pose with my sword, and he would build a working crossbow that you could shoot an arrow into a tree.
So he joins the army.
Well, he just retired a colonel in the Green Berets.
He's a multidecorated combat veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq.
He now teaches a sail camp for children of fallen soldiers.
He gave his life to his passion.
His creativity was leadership, leading others, his bravery, to help others.
That was something he felt called to do, and it gave back to him.
We know this -- the time of our life is so short, and how we spend it -- are we spending it doing what's important to us?
Most of us not.
I mean, it's hard.
The pull of habit is so huge, and that's what makes kids so beautifully creative, is that they don't have any habits, and they don't care if they're any good or not, right?
They're not building a sandcastle going, "I think I'm going to be a really good sandcastle builder.
" They just throw themselves at whatever project you put in front of them -- dancing, doing a painting, building something: any opportunity they have, they try to use it to impress upon you their individuality.
It's so beautiful.
And when you do that, this healing happens, and we come out of our corners, and we start to witness each other's common humanity.
And when we do that, really good things happen.
There's no path till you walk it, and you have to be willing to play the fool.
Don't listen to the music that you used to like.
I guarantee, if you do that, you will feel foolish.
That's the point.
Play the fool.
(Plays guitar) (Sings) Well, I want to go Austin, and I wanna stay home.
Live for danger.
Many of us like to start the day with a cup of coffee and perhaps end the day with a glass of wine or some other kind of alcoholic drink.
[Sleeping with Science] (Music) Let's start with caffeine.
Caffeine is in a class of drugs that we call the psychoactive stimulants.
And so that's the first way in which alcohol can be problematic.
We're mistaking sedation for deep sleep.
The second problem with alcohol is that it can actually fragment your sleep.
Alcohol can actually trigger and activate during sleep what we call the fight or flight branch of the nervous system, which will therefore wake you up more frequently throughout the night.
And alcohol can even increase the amount of alerting chemicals that are released by the brain, once again fragmenting your sleep.
The third and final issue with alcohol and sleep is that alcohol can actually block your rapid eye movement sleep, or your dream sleep.
And as we'll learn in subsequent episodes, REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep, dream sleep, provides a collection of benefits, things such as your emotional and mental health, even creativity.
Now I'm not here to tell anyone how to live.
I don't want to be puritanical.
I'm just a scientist.
What I want to try and do is provide you with the information about the relationship between caffeine and alcohol on your sleep so then you can make an informed choice as to how best you want to live your life when you're trying to prioritize your sleep health.
Good evening. It is such a blessing to work at the Harlem Children's Zone, an African-American-led organization that has pioneered the field of comprehensive place-based services, from cradle to career.
And that word, "comprehensive," is so key to what we do.
You know, most interventions focus on one piece of a complicated, giant puzzle.
But that's not enough to solve the puzzle.
You don't solve education without understanding the home context or the home environment of our young scholar.
Or the broader context of health, nutrition or criminal justice.
The unit of change for us is not the individual child, it's the entire neighborhood. You have to do multiple things at the same time.
And we have 20 years of data to prove that this works.
We've had 7,000 graduates of our baby college, we've eliminated the Black-white achievement gap in our schools.
We've reduced obesity rates in our health programs and have close to 1,000 students enrolled in college. We weave together a net of services so tightly, so that no one will fall through the cracks.
And we've inspired global practitioners.
We've had over 500-plus communities across the US and 70-plus countries come and visit us to learn our model.
You see, the problems of the globe, and the problems of the world are not neatly siloed into buckets.
So therefore the solutions must be comprehensive, they must be holistic.
And now we're in the midst of a global pandemic.
COVID-19 has revealed to us what we always knew to be true.
The poorest among us pay the highest price with their lives and their livelihood.
And that's playing out every day in the African American community, where we're 3.6 times more likely to die of COVID than our white counterparts.
We're seeing those health disparities on the ground in New York City, our nation's epicenter.
And to compound the impact of the health disparities, there's significant economic devastation, where one in four of our families in Harlem report food insecurity, and 57 percent report a loss of income or a loss of their job.
But to better understand the work of the Harlem Children's Zone, I want to share a story with you, about a second-grade scholar named Sean.
Sean is a beautiful Black boy whose smile would light up any room that he's in.
And when quarantine began in March, we noticed that Sean wasn't attending virtual school. And after some investigation, we've come to learn that Sean's mom was hospitalized due to COVID.
So he was at home with grandma and his baby sibling, who was his only viable support system, since Sean's father is incarcerated.
Grandma was struggling.
There wasn't much food in the household, limited diapers, and Sean didn't even have a computer.
When mom was released from the hospital, their challenges deepened, because they could no longer stay with grandma, due to her preexisting health conditions.
So Sean, his baby sibling and his mom had to go to a shelter.
Sean's story is not atypical at the Harlem Children's Zone.
We know Sean and millions like him all across the country deserve to have everything that this world has to offer, without inequality robbing them of that opportunity.
All the result of racism and historical and systemic underinvestment are now compounded by COVID-19. Our comprehensive model uniquely positions the Harlem Children's Zone in the fight of COVID.
The success that we have on the ground in Harlem makes it imperative, and it is our responsibility to share what we know works with the country.
We have developed a comprehensive COVID-19 relief and recovery response for our community, that was surfaced from our community, focused on five primary areas of need, and already servicing families like Sean's. They are the following.
One, emergency relief funds.
We know that our families need cash in their hands right now.
Two, protecting our most vulnerable.
We know our families need access to essential goods and information.
So that is food, that's masks, that's a curated resource list and public health campaigns.
Three, bridging the digital divide.
We believe that internet is a fundamental right. So we need to ensure our families have connectivity, and also all school-age children in a household have the proper learning devices.
Four, zero learning loss.
We know that there's a generation of students at risk of losing an entire year of their education.
We need to make sure that we are providing high-quality virtual programing, in addition to having safe reentry planned for school reentry.
And five, mitigating the mental health crisis.
There's a generation at risk of having PTSD, due to the massive amounts of toxic stress.
We need to ensure that our families have access to telehealth and other virtual supports.
We have six amazing partners across six cities in the United States that are adopting our model for their own context in their community.
They are Oakland, Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Newark and Atlanta.
In addition to those partners, we have three national partners, who will be sharing our model and sharing our strategies through their network, in addition to amplifying our impact by policy advocacy.
We will have impact on three levels.
Individual impact on the ground in Harlem, across a number of outcomes in education, in health, in economics, reaching 30,000 people.
There's community-level impact across six cities, again through our amazing partners, that will reach an additional 70,000 people.
And then national impact, not only through policy advocacy, but through capacity building at scale.
Our answer to COVID-19, the despair and inequities plaguing our communities, is targeting neighborhoods with comprehensive services.
We have certainly not lost hope.
And we invite you to join us on the front lines of this war. Thank you.Good evening. It is such a blessing to work at the Harlem Children's Zone, an African-American-led organization that has pioneered the field of comprehensive place-based services, from cradle to career.

And now we're in the midst of a global pandemic.
COVID-19 has revealed to us what we always knew to be true.
The poorest among us pay the highest price with their lives and their livelihood.
And that's playing out every day in the African American community, where we're 3.6 times more likely to die of COVID than our white counterparts.
We're seeing those health disparities on the ground in New York City, our nation's epicenter.
And to compound the impact of the health disparities, there's significant economic devastation, where one in four of our families in Harlem report food insecurity, and 57 percent report a loss of income or a loss of their job.
But to better understand the work of the Harlem Children's Zone, I want to share a story with you, about a second-grade scholar named Sean.
Sean is a beautiful Black boy whose smile would light up any room that he's in.
And when quarantine began in March, we noticed that Sean wasn't attending virtual school. And after some investigation, we've come to learn that Sean's mom was hospitalized due to COVID.
So he was at home with grandma and his baby sibling, who was his only viable support system, since Sean's father is incarcerated.
Grandma was struggling.
There wasn't much food in the household, limited diapers, and Sean didn't even have a computer.
When mom was released from the hospital, their challenges deepened, because they could no longer stay with grandma, due to her preexisting health conditions.
So Sean, his baby sibling and his mom had to go to a shelter.
Sean's story is not atypical at the Harlem Children's Zone.
The success that we have on the ground in Harlem makes it imperative, and it is our responsibility to share what we know works with the country.
We have developed a comprehensive COVID-19 relief and recovery response for our community, that was surfaced from our community, focused on five primary areas of need, and already servicing families like Sean's. They are the following.
One, emergency relief funds.
We know that our families need cash in their hands right now.
Two, protecting our most vulnerable.
We know our families need access to essential goods and information.
So that is food, that's masks, that's a curated resource list and public health campaigns.
Three, bridging the digital divide.
We believe that internet is a fundamental right. So we need to ensure our families have connectivity, and also all school-age children in a household have the proper learning devices.
Four, zero learning loss.
We know that there's a generation of students at risk of losing an entire year of their education.
We need to make sure that we are providing high-quality virtual programing, in addition to having safe reentry planned for school reentry.
And five, mitigating the mental health crisis.
There's a generation at risk of having PTSD, due to the massive amounts of toxic stress.
We need to ensure that our families have access to telehealth and other virtual supports.
We have six amazing partners across six cities in the United States that are adopting our model for their own context in their community.
They are Oakland, Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Newark and Atlanta.
In addition to those partners, we have three national partners, who will be sharing our model and sharing our strategies through their network, in addition to amplifying our impact by policy advocacy.
We will have impact on three levels.
Individual impact on the ground in Harlem, across a number of outcomes in education, in health, in economics, reaching 30,000 people.
There's community-level impact across six cities, again through our amazing partners, that will reach an additional 70,000 people.
And then national impact, not only through policy advocacy, but through capacity building at scale.
Our answer to COVID-19, the despair and inequities plaguing our communities, is targeting neighborhoods with comprehensive services.
We have certainly not lost hope.
And we invite you to join us on the front lines of this war. Thank you.
My name is Shari Davis, and let's be honest, I'm a recovering government employee.
And I say that with a huge shout-out to the folks that work in government and on systems change.
It's hard.
It can be isolating. And the work can feel impossible.
But government is the people that show up.
Really, it's the people that can show up and are committed to the promise that public service offers: service to people, democracy and fixing the problems that community members face.
Seventeen years ago, I walked through city hall for the first time as a staff member.
And that walk revealed something to me. I was a unicorn.
There weren't many people who looked like me that worked in the building.
And yet, there were folks committed to addressing hundreds of years of systemic inequity that left some behind and many ignored.
Where there was promise, there was a huge problem.
You see, democracy, as it was originally designed, had a fatal flaw.
It only laid pipeline for rich white men to progress.
And now, if you're a smart rich white man, you understand why I say that's a problem.
Massive talent has been left off the field.
Our moral imaginations have grown anemic.
Our highest offices are plagued by corruption.
We're on the brink of a sort of apathetic apocalypse, and it's not OK.
We've got to open the doors to city halls and schools so wide that people can't help but walk in.
We've got to throw out the old top-down processes that got us into this mess, and start over, with new faces around the table, new voices in the mix, and we have to welcome new perspectives every step of the way.
Not because it's the right thing to do -- although it is -- but because that's the only way for us to all succeed together.
And here's the best news of all.
I know how to do it.
The answer -- well, an answer, is participatory budgeting. That's right. Participatory budgeting, or "PB" for short.
PB is a process that brings community and government together to ideate, develop concrete proposals and vote on projects that solve real problems in community.
Now I realize that people don't get up and dance when I start talking about public budgets.
But participatory budgeting is actually about collective, radical imagination.
Everyone has a role to play in PB, and it works, because it allows community members to craft real solutions to real problems and provides the infrastructure for the promise of government.
And honestly, it's how I saw a democracy actually work for the first time.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
It was 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts, and mayor Menino asked me to launch the country's first youth-focused PB effort with one million dollars of city funds.
Now, we didn't start with line items and limits or spreadsheets and formulas.
We started with people.
We wanted to make sure that everyone was listened to.
So we brought in young people from historically and traditionally marginalized neighborhoods, members of the queer community and youth that were formerly incarcerated, and together, often with pizza and a sugar-free beverage, we talked about how to make Boston better.
And we designed a process that we called "Youth Lead the Change.
" We imagined a Boston where young people could access the information that they need to thrive.
Where they could feel safe in their communities, and where they can transform public spaces into real hubs of life for all people.
And that's exactly what they did.
In the first year, young people allocated 90,000 dollars to increase technology access for Boston public high school students, by delivering laptops right to Boston public high schools, so that students could thrive inside and outside of the classroom.
They allocated 60,000 dollars to creating art walls that literally and figuratively brightened up public spaces.
But they addressed a more important problem.
Young people were being criminalized and pulled into the justice system for putting their art on walls.
So this gave them a safe space to practice their craft.
They allocated 400,000 dollars to renovating parks, to make them more accessible for all people of all bodies.
Now, admittedly, this didn't go as smoothly as we had planned.
Right before we broke ground on the park, we actually found out that it was on top of an archaeological site and had to halt construction.
If that isn't a reflection of radical imagination in government, I don't know what is.
What sounds simple is actually transformational for the people and communities involved.
I'm seeing community members shape transportation access, improve their schools and even transform government buildings, so that there is space inside of them for them.
Before we had PB, I would see people who look like me and come from where I come from walk in to government buildings for this new initiative or that new working group, and then I'd watch them walk right back out.
Sometimes I wouldn't see them again.
It's because their expertise was being unvalued.
They weren't truly being engaged in the process.
Put PB is different.
When we started doing PB, I met amazing young leaders across the city.
One in particular, a rock star, Malachi Hernandez, 15 years old, came into a community meeting -- shy, curious, a little quiet.
Stuck around and became one of the young people hoping to lead the project.
Now fast-forward a couple of years.
Malachi was the first in his family to attend college.
A couple of weeks ago, he was the first in his family to graduate.
Malachi has appeared in the Obama White House several times as part of the My Brother's Keeper initiative. President Obama even quotes Malachi in interviews.
It's true, you can look it up.
Malachi got engaged, stayed engaged, and is out here changing the way we think about community leadership and potential.
Or my friend Maria Hadden, who was involved in the first PB process in Chicago.
Then went on to become a founding participatory budgeting project board member, eventually a staff member, and then unseated a 28-year incumbent, becoming the first queer Black alderperson in Chicago's history. That's real engagement.
That's being taken seriously.
That's building out and building on community leadership.
That's system change.
And it's not just in the US either.
After starting 30 years ago in Brazil, PB has spread to over 7,000 cities across the globe.
In Paris, France, the mayor puts up five percent of her budget, over 100 million euros, for community members to decide on and shape their city.
Globally, PB has been shown to improve public health, reduce corruption and increase trust in government.
Now we know the challenges that we face in today's society.
How can we expect people to feel motivated, to show up to the polls when they can't trust that government is run by and for the people.
I argue that we haven't actually experienced true participatory democracy in these United States of America just yet.
But democracy is a living, breathing thing.
And it's still our birthright.
It's time to renew trust, and that's not going to come easy.
We have to build new ways of thinking, of talking, of working, of dreaming, of planning in its place.
What would America look like if everyone had a seat at the table?
If we took the time to reimagine what's possible, and then ask, "How do we get there?
" My favorite author, Octavia Butler, says it best.
In "Parable of the Sower," basically my Bible, she says, "All that you touch You Change.
All that you Change Changes you.
" It's time for these 50 states to change.
What got us here sure as hell won't get us there.
We've got to kick the walls of power down and plant gardens of genuine democracy in their place.
That's how we change systems.
By opening doors so wide that people can't help but walk in.
So what's stopping you from bringing participatory budgeting to your community?
You can ask anyone you want, and they will tell you that they are sick and tired of fighting for justice.
People of color and members of the LGBT community are tired of carrying the burden of speaking up and stepping up even when they're being silenced and pushed back down.
And white allies and cis allies are tired, too.
Tired of being told they're doing it wrong or that it isn't even their place to show up at all.
This fatigue is impacting all of us.
And in fact, I believe we won't succeed until we approach justice in a new way.
I grew up in the middle of the civil rights movement in the segregated South.
As a five-year-old girl, I was very interested in ballet.
It seemed to be the five-year-old-girl thing to do in the 1960s.
My mother took me to a ballet school.
You know, the kind of school that had teachers that talked about your gifts and talents knowing that you'd never be a ballerina.
(Laughter) When we arrived, they said nicely that they "did not accept Negroes.
" We got back in the car as if we were just leaving a grocery store that was out of orange juice.
We said nothing . . . just drove to the next ballet school.
They said, "We don't accept Negroes.
" Well, I was confused.
And I asked my mother why they didn't want me.
And she said, "Well, they're just not smart enough to accept you right now, and they don't know how excellent you are.
" (Cheers) (Applause and cheers) Well, I didn't know what that meant.
(Laughter) But I was sure it wasn't good, because I could see it in my mother's eyes.
She was angry, and it looked like she was on the verge of tears.
Well, I decided right then and right there that ballet was dumb.
(Laughter) You know, I had lots of experiences like that along the way, but as I got older, I started to get angry.
And not just angry at the outright racism and injustice.
I was angry at people that stood by and didn't say anything.
Like, why didn't the white parents in that ballet school say "Uh, that's wrong.
Let that little girl dance.
" Or why -- (Applause) Why didn't the white patrons in the segregated restaurants say "Hey, that's not right.
Let that family eat.
" Well, it didn't take me long to realize that racial injustice wasn't the only place that people in the majority were staying quiet.
When I'd sit in church and hear some homophobic comment being disguised as something scriptural, I'd say, "I'm sorry, why aren't the heterosexual churchgoers disrupting this nonsense?
" (Applause) Or . . . in a room filled with boomers and Gen-Xers who started degrading their millennial colleagues as being spoiled, lazy and overconfident, I'd say, "I'm sorry, why isn't someone my age saying 'stop stereotyping? '" (Audience) Yes!
(Applause) I was used to standing up on issues like this, but why wasn't everyone else?
My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. McFarland, taught me that justice requires an accomplice.
Not just anyone will do.
She said we need unlikely allies if we want to see real change happen.
And for those of us experiencing injustice up front, we need to be willing to accept the help, because when we don't, change takes too long.
I mean, imagine if heterosexual and gay people had not come together under the banner of marriage equality.
Most of our major movements in this country might have been delayed or even dead if it weren't for the presence of unlikely allies.
Well, if I can be honest with you, I think it was the first time we'd ever seen a white lady in our school ever.
(Laughter) Miss Ann stood in front of us, and she said she was going to start teaching ballet classes right there are our school and that she was proud to be our dance teacher.
(Laughter) You see, what I know now is Miss Ann was fully aware that the white ballet schools would not accept Black girls.
So she came to the Black neighborhood to start teaching the dance classes herself.
Usually, the rock is strong enough and heavy enough to keep the magma in place.
But when this equilibrium is thrown off, the consequences can be explosive.
One of the most common causes of an eruption is an increase in magmastatic pressure.
Magma contains various elements and compounds, many of which are dissolved in the molten rock.
At high enough concentrations, compounds like water or sulfur no longer dissolve, and instead form high-pressure gas bubbles.
When these bubbles reach the surface, they can burst with the force of a gunshot.
And when millions of bubbles explode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash into the stratosphere.
But before they pop, they act like bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda.
Their presence lowers the magma’s density, and increases the buoyant force pushing upward through the crust. Many geologists believe this process was behind the Paricutin eruption in Mexico. There are two known natural causes for these buoyant bubbles.
Sometimes, new magma from deeper underground brings additional gassy compounds into the mix.
But bubbles can also form when magma begins to cool.
In its molten state, magma is a mixture of dissolved gases and melted minerals.
As the molten rock hardens, some of those minerals solidify into crystals.
This process doesn’t incorporate many of the dissolved gasses, resulting in a higher concentration of the compounds that form explosive bubbles.
Not all eruptions are due to rising magmastatic pressure— sometimes the weight of the rock above can become dangerously low.
Landslides can remove massive quantities of rock from atop a magma chamber, dropping the lithostatic pressure and instantly triggering an eruption.
This process is known as “unloading” and it’s been responsible for numerous eruptions, including the sudden explosion of Mount St.
Helens in 1980. But unloading can also happen over longer periods of time due to erosion or melting glaciers.
In fact, many geologists are worried that glacial melt caused by climate change could increase volcanic activity.
Finally, eruptions can occur when the rock layer is no longer strong enough to hold back the magma below.
Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma can corrode rock through a process called hydrothermal alteration, gradually turning hard stone into soft clay.
The rock layer could also be weakened by tectonic activity.
Earthquakes can create fissures allowing magma to escape to the surface, and the Earth’s crust can be stretched thin as continental plates shift away from each other.
Unfortunately, knowing what causes eruptions doesn’t make them easy to predict.
While scientists can roughly determine the strength and weight of the Earth’s crust, the depth and heat of magma chambers makes measuring changes in magmastatic pressure very difficult.
But volcanologists are constantly exploring new technology to conquer this rocky terrain.
Advances in thermal imaging have allowed scientists to detect subterranean hotspots.
Spectrometers can analyze gases escaping magma.
And lasers can precisely track the impact of rising magma on a volcano’s shape. Hopefully, these tools will help us better understand these volatile vents and their explosive eruptions.
In the sun-dappled streets of a small town, a proud mother showed off her newborn son.
Upon noticing his lucky birthmark, townsfolk predicted he would marry a princess.
But soon, these rumors reached the ears of the wicked king.
Enraged, the king stole the child away, and sent him hurtling down the river.
But the infant’s luck proved greater than the king’s plan.
Years later, the king was traveling his realm, when he spotted a strapping young man with an uncanny birthmark.
After confirming the child’s origins, the sly king entrusted the boy with a letter for the queen.
The youth eagerly set out to deliver the message— not knowing he was carrying his own death sentence. That night, roaming bandits stumbled upon his camp.
Yet when they read the brutal letter, they were filled with pity.
Deciding to make trouble for the king instead, they scribbled a new note.
As soon as the youth arrived at the palace, he locked eyes with the princess.
The two felt destined for each other.
And when the queen read that the king approved this union, she joyfully organized a whirlwind wedding. When the king returned, he was furious.
But he couldn’t execute his daughter’s beloved without reason.
So he devised a diabolical trial.
He ordered the youth to travel to Hell itself, and return with three golden hairs freshly plucked from the Devil’s head.
Only upon succeeding could he return to his bride.
The youth searched across the land for the entrance to Hell, until he finally reached an eerie village.
Here, he saw some villagers gathered around a well.
They closed in on the youth, refusing to let him pass until he answered their question: why was the well dry?
The youth replied, “I will answer when I return.
” They directed him further into town, where he came across another set of villagers contemplating a gnarled tree.
They refused to let him pass until he answered their question: why was the tree barren?
Again, the youth responded, “I will answer when I return.
" These villagers guided him to the dock, where an elderly ferryman awaited.
As he paddled through the black water, the ferryman rasped a third question: how can I escape my interminable task?
Once more, the youth promised, “I will answer when I return.
” At last, they reached a hut sinking into the swampy banks of Hell.
Reluctantly, the youth knocked on the rotting door.
The devil’s grandmother answered his call.
She was known to help some visiting souls, and harm others.
The youth had just finished his story when they heard the devil’s footsteps.
Without warning, the boy’s world appeared to shrink.
The devil’s grandmother lifted him into the folds of her sleeve, and welcomed her grandson.
The old woman set to work, lavishing the devil with food and drink.
Back at the village, the youth declared that there was a mouse gnawing at the root of the tree, and an enormous toad blocking the well.
Back from his journey, the youth thrust the devil’s hairs at the king— but his greedy father-in-law only had eyes for the gold.
The sly youth told the king that even greater wealth awaited him across the river.
Eager to claim his riches, he held out his hands impatiently to the grinning ferryman— who happily handed over his oars.In the sun-dappled streets of a small town, a proud mother showed off her newborn son.
But soon, these rumors reached the ears of the wicked king.
But the infant’s luck proved greater than the king’s plan.
Years later, the king was traveling his realm, when he spotted a strapping young man with an uncanny birthmark.

The youth had just finished his story when they heard the devil’s footsteps.
The devil’s grandmother lifted him into the folds of her sleeve, and welcomed her grandson.
He shared the devil’s first dream with the ferryman. If the boatman could hand his oars to a willing passenger, he would be free from his task.
(Video) President Buhari: I don't know which party my wife belongs to, but she belongs to my kitchen.
Adeola Fayehun: Oh, my God!
I need some water -- I said I need some water!
See?
I basically keep it real with them, ha! Especially when they mess up, which is a lot of times. If any African official is watching me, by the way, I'm not talking about you, sir.
I'm talking about your colleagues, yes.
I do this because Africa has everything in it to be great.
You know, I grew up believing that Africa as a continent is a giant. We've got skills, intellectuals, natural resources more than any other continent. Africa supplies 31 percent of the world's gold, manganese and uranium, 57 percent of the world's diamonds and 13 percent of the world's oil.
We have no reason to depend on aid or borrowing money from China or the World Bank.
But without good leaders, we're like an eagle that has no idea it could fly, let alone soar.
Africa is a like a sleeping giant. Now the truth is, I'm trying to wake up this giant, and that's why I air the dirty laundry of those in charge of the giant.
Our politicians, our religious leaders, with huge respect, of course, because more than anything else, African leaders love to be respected.
So I give it to them in doses.
On my show, I kneel for them -- ha! -- I call them my uncles, my aunties, my fathers in the lord, and then -- I insult them for insulting our intelligence.
And it's because we are tired of the hypocrisy and false promises.
For example, the Nigerian president vowed to end medical tourism by fixing our dilapidated hospitals and building us new ones.
But what did he do?
He spends three months receiving treatment in London in 2017. We were without a president for three months.
We were president-less for three months.
So then it becomes my job to call out the President, with respect, of course.
I said, "Ha, Mr. President, it's your girl, Adeola.
You know how I do, how you doing?
You have no shame.
" I forgot to add "sir.
" "Sir, you have no shame.
(In Yoruba: You have no fear of God.
) You have no fear of God. " Thirty-five thousand Nigerian doctors are presently working in the US, the UK and Canada, doing amazing things, because in Nigeria, they are not well-paid, neither do they have the necessary equipment to do the job of being a doctor.
And this is happening in many African countries.
We have the capacity to fly. But sadly, a lot of African talent is flying straight out of Africa to other continents.
For example, this Nigerian doctor operated on an unborn baby in Texas.
Also, this Nigerian doctor discovered the neurological effects of concussion on athletes.
And many countries have African athletes winning the gold medal for them. The interesting thing is, we're waiting for God to fix Africa.
Like, for real, it's not a joke, we are, we're waiting for God.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. We want God to fix it.
Do you see what I have to deal with?
I'm telling you, thunder is getting ready to hit these politicians some day.
We are better than this. I want our leaders to start taking responsibility and stop putting everything on God. God has given us everything we need. It's right here, let's use it.
Also, popular British architect David Adjaye has designed spectacular buildings around the world.
And while I have your attention, I have one more thing to say, so please move closer.
OK, that's good, don't get too close, that's good.
I don't like the way some of you portray Africa.
Not all of you, just some of you.
You especially.
First of all, it's not a country, it's a continent.
I do not know Paul from Uganda, I don't know Rebecca from Zimbabwe. Nigeria is as far from Zimbabwe as New York is from France. And it's not a bunch of naked people in need of Western charity.
You have it all wrong.
Lions are not roaming our streets, OK?
And I could go on, but you already know what I'm talking about.
Oh, my God, watch African movies.Or at the very least, learn some of the names of our 54 beautiful countries.That's right, 54, baby, five-four.Alright, y'all, it's been real, and I'm keeping it real right up in here.Until next time, I'm going to see you all later. Peace out.What's up, people?
First of all, I cannot believe I'm on TED Talk. This is a big deal.
Because right now, everybody in my village is watching this.
And so, of course, my bride price just went up.
My name is Adeola Fayehun.
I'm from Nigeria.
I live in the US, I'm a journalist, or a comedian, or a satirist, anything you want me to be, really.
I'm every woman, it's all in me.
I host a YouTube show called "Keeping It Real with Adeola. " Now this show is a gentle, respectful and very blunt way of calling out corrupt African leaders.

Language is endlessly variable.
Each of us can come up with an infinite number of sentences in our native language, and we’re able to do so from an early age— almost as soon as we start to communicate in sentences.
How is this possible?
In the early 1950s, Noam Chomsky proposed a theory based on the observation that the key to this versatility seems to be grammar: the familiar grammatical structure of an unfamiliar sentence points us toward its meaning.
He suggested that there are grammatical rules that apply to all languages, and that the rules are innate— the human brain is hardwired to process language according to these rules.
He labelled this faculty universal grammar, and it launched lines of inquiry that shaped both the field of linguistics and the emerging field of cognitive science for decades to come.
Chomsky and other researchers set out to investigate the two main components of universal grammar: first, whether there are, in fact, grammar rules that are universal to all languages, and, second, whether these rules are hardwired in the brain.
In attempts to establish the universal rules of grammar, Chomsky developed an analytical tool known as generative syntax, which represents the order of words in a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees that show what structures are possible.
Based on this tree, we could suggest a grammar rule that adverbs must occur in verb phrases.
But with more data, it quickly becomes clear that adverbs can appear outside of verb phrases.
This simplified example illustrates a major problem: it takes a lot of data from each individual language to establish the rules for that language, before we can even begin to determine which rules all languages might have in common.
When Chomsky proposed universal grammar, many languages lacked the volume of recorded samples necessary to analyze them using generative syntax.
Even with lots of data, mapping the structure of a language is incredibly complex.
After 50 years of analysis, we still haven’t completely figured out English.
As more linguist data was gathered and analyzed, it became clear that languages around the world differ widely, challenging the theory that there were universal grammar rules.
In the 1980s, Chomsky revised his theory in an attempt to accommodate this variation.
According to his new hypothesis of principles and parameters, all languages shared certain grammatical principles, but could vary in their parameters, or the application of these principles.
For example, a principle is “every sentence must have a subject," but the parameter of whether the subject must be explicitly stated could vary between languages.
The hypothesis of principles and parameters still didn’t answer the question of which grammatical principles are universal.
In the early 2000s, Chomsky suggested that there’s just one shared principle, called recursion, which means structures can be nested inside each other.
Take this sentence, which embeds a sentence within a sentence within a sentence.
Or this sentence, which embeds a noun phrase in a noun phrase in a noun phrase.
Recursion was a good candidate for a universal grammar rule because it can take many forms.
However, in 2005 linguists published findings on an Amazonian language called Piraha, which doesn’t appear to have any recursive structures.
So what about the other part of Chomsky’s theory, that our language faculty is innate?
When he first proposed universal grammar, the idea that there was a genetically determined aspect of language acquisition had a profound, revolutionary impact.
It challenged the dominant paradigm, called behaviorism.
Behaviorists argued that all animal and human behaviors, including language, were acquired from the outside by the mind, which starts out as a blank slate.
Today, scientists agree that behaviorism was wrong, and there is underlying, genetically encoded biological machinery for language learning.
Many think the same biology responsible for language is also responsible for other aspects of cognition.
So they disagree with Chomsky’s idea that there is a specific, isolated, innate language faculty in the brain.
The theory of universal grammar prompted the documentation and study of many languages that hadn’t been studied before.
It also caused an old idea to be reevaluated and eventually overthrown to make room for our growing understanding of the human brain.
Our history records many women of strength and action.
A President of the United Nations General Assembly, a renowned circuit court judge, a president of the University of Liberia.
I knew that I had to form a very strong team with the capacity to address the challenges of our nation.
And I wanted to put women in all top positions.
But I knew that was not possible.
And so I settled for putting them in strategic positions.
I recruited a very able economist from the World Bank to be our minister of finance, to lead our debt-relief effort.
Another to be the minister of foreign affairs, to reactivate our bilateral and multilateral relationships.
The first woman chief of police to address the fears of our women, who had suffered so much during the civil war.
Another to be the minister of gender, to be able to ensure the protection and the participation of women.
Over time, the minister of justice, the minister of public works, the minister of agriculture, the minister of commerce and industry.
Participation in leadership was unprecedented in my administration.
And although I knew that there were not enough women with the experience to form an all-women cabinet -- as I wanted -- I settled to appoint numerous women in junior ministerial positions, as executives, as administrators, in local government, in diplomatic service, in the judiciary, in public institutions.
It worked. At the end of 2012, our economic growth had peaked at nine percent.
Our infrastructure was being reconstructed at a very fast pace. Our institutions were functioning again.
Our debt of 4.9 billion had been largely canceled.
We had good relationships with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the African Development Bank.
We also had good working relationships with all our sister African countries and many nations all over the world.
Our women could sleep peacefully at night again, without fear.
Our children were smiling again, as I promised them during my first inaugural address.
The reputation and credibility of our nation, lost in the many years of conflict, were restored.
But progress is never guaranteed.
And in our legislature, in my first term, women were 14 percent.
Nobody is perfect.
But there's nothing more predictable than a strong woman who wants to change things, who's brave to speak out, who's bold in action.
But I'm OK with the criticism.
I know why I made the decisions I made, and I'm happy with the results.
But that's why more women leaders are needed.
For there will always be those who will tear us down, who will tear us apart, because they want the status quo to remain.
Although sub-Saharan Africa has had major breakthroughs in women's leadership and participation, particularly in the legislature -- in parliament, as it's called -- so many women, 50 percent and over, one of our nations, well over 60 percent, the best in the world -- but we know that's not enough.
While we must be very thankful and applaud the progress we have made, we know that there is much more work to be done.
The work will have to address the lingering vestiges of structural . . . something against women.
In too many places, political parties are based on patronage, patriarchy, misogyny that try to keep women from their rightful places, that shut them out from taking leadership positions.
Too often, women face -- while the best performers, while equal or better in competence -- unequal pay.
And so we must continue to work to change things.
We must be able to change the stereotyping.
We must be able to ensure that those structural barriers that have kept women from being able to have the equity they rightfully deserve.
And we must also work with men.
Because increasingly, there is recognition that full gender equity will ensure a stronger economy, a more developed nation, a more peaceful nation.
And that is why we must continue to work.
And that is why we're partners.
I will be launching a Center for Women and Development that will bring together -- (Applause) women who have started and are committed to their joining of leadership.
With women who have excelled and advanced in leadership together.
Over a 10-year period, we strongly believe that we will create this wave of women who are prepared to take, unabashedly, intentional leadership and influence throughout society.
This is why -- (Laughs) at 81, I cannot retire.
(Applause and laughter) (Applause and cheers) Women are working for change in Africa.
Women are working for change throughout the world.
I will be with them, and one of them, forever.
(Applause) Thank you for listening.
Go out and change the world.
(Applause and cheers)
I promise you that I will not sing.
I will spare you that, at least.
But I am a historian with a background in philosophy, and my main area of research is basically the history of Southeast Asia, with a focus on 19th-century colonial Southeast Asia.
And over the last few years, what I've been doing is really tracing the history of certain ideas that shape our viewpoint, the way we in Asia, in Southeast Asia, look at ourselves and understand ourselves.
Now, there's one thing that I cannot explain as a historian, and this has been puzzling me for a long time, and this is how and why certain ideas, certain viewpoints do not seem to ever go away. And I don't know why.
So let's imagine that I build a time machine for myself.
(Makes beeping noises) I build a time machine, I send myself back to the 1860s, a hundred years before I was born.
Oh dear, I've just dated myself.OK, I go back a hundred years before I was born.
Now, if I were to find myself in the context of colonial Southeast Asia in the 19th century, I would not be a professor.
Historians know this.
I can find out the origins of certain clichés, certain stereotypes.
I can tell you who came up with it, where and when and in which book.
But there's one thing I cannot do: I cannot get into the internal, subjective mental universe of someone and change their mind.
And I think this is where and why, over the last few years, I'm increasingly drawn to things like psychology and cognitive behavioral therapy; because in these fields, scholars look at the persistence of ideas.
Why do some people have certain prejudices?
Why are there certain biases, certain phobias?
We live, unfortunately, sadly, in a world where, still, misogyny persists, racism persists, all kinds of phobias.
Islamophobia, for instance, is now a term.
And why do these ideas persist?
Many scholars agree that it's partly because, when looking at the world, we fall back, we fall back, we fall back on a finite pool, a small pool of basic ideas that don't get challenged.
Look at how we, particularly us in Southeast Asia, represent ourselves to ourselves and to the world.
Look at how often, when we talk about ourselves, my viewpoint, my identity, our identity, invariably, we fall back, we fall back, we fall back, we fall back on the same set of ideas, all of which have histories of their own.
Very simple example: we live in Southeast Asia, which is very popular with tourists from all over the world.
And I don't think that's a bad thing, by the way.
I think it's good that tourists come to Southeast Asia, because it's part and parcel of broadening your worldview and meeting cultures, etc, etc.
But look at how we represent ourselves through the tourist campaigns, the tourist ads that we produce.
There will be the obligatory coconut tree, banana tree, orangutan.
(Laughter) And the orangutan doesn't even get paid.
(Laughter) Look at how we represent ourselves.
Look at how we represent nature.
Look at how we represent the countryside. Look at how we represent agricultural life.
Watch our sitcoms.
Watch our dramas.
Watch our movies.
So the way in which we live in our part of the world, postcolonial Southeast Asia, in so many ways, for me, bears residual traces to ideas, tropes, clichés, stereotypes that have a history.
But we are not critical in interrogating ourselves and asking ourselves, how did I have this view of the world?
We've turned Southeast Asian identity into a kind of cosplay where you can literally go to the supermarket, go to the mall and buy your do-it-yourself exotic Southeast Asian costume kit. And we parade this identity, not asking ourselves how and when did this particular image of ourselves emerge.
But for us to adapt to this change, for us to be ready for that change, we need to think out of the box, and we can't fall back, we can't fall back, we can't fall back on the same set of clichéd, tired, staid old stereotypes.
And they need to take place now, because we need to understand that the way things are today are not determined by some fixed, iron historical railway track, but rather there are many other histories, many other ideas that were forgotten, marginalized, erased along the line.
So to go back to that time machine example I gave earlier.
It's in the language we use. It's in the fiction we write. It's in the movies we choose to watch. It's in the images that we conjure when we think of who and what we are.
(Applause)
I could see people falling down, gunshots.
" Noria Dambrine Dusabireme: During nights we would hear shots, we would hear guns.
And most of the young people died.
SAS: We boarded a vehicle.
It was overloaded.
People were running for their lives.
That is how I fled from Somalia.
My mom missed me.
Nobody told her where I went.
NDD: The fact that we did not go to school, we couldn't go to the market, we were just stuck home made me realize that if I got an option to go for something better, I could just go for it and have a better future.
(Music) Ignazio Matteini: Globally, displaced people in the world have been increasing.
Now there are almost 60 million people displaced in the world.
And unfortunately, it doesn't stop.
Chrystina Russell: I think the humanitarian community is starting to realize from research and reality that we're talking about a much more permanent problem.
Baylie Damtie Yeshita: These students, they need a tertiary education, a degree that they can use.
If the students are living now in Rwanda, if they get relocated, still they can continue their study.
Still, their degree is useful, wherever they are.
CR: Our audacious project was to really test Southern New Hampshire University's Global Education Movement's ability to scale, to bring bachelor's degrees and pathways to employment to refugees and those who would otherwise not have access to higher education.
SAS: It was almost impossible, as a refugee person, to further my education and to make my career.
My name is Saida Aden Said, and I am from Somalia.
I was nine years old when I came to Kakuma, and I started going to school at 17. Now I am doing my bachelor degree with SNHU.
NDD: My name is Noria Dambrine Dusabireme.
I'm doing my bachelor of arts in communications with a concentration in business.
CR: We are serving students across five different countries: Lebanon, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda and South Africa.
Really proud to have 800 AA grads to over 400 bachelor's graduates and nearly 1,000 students enrolled right now.
So, the magic of this is that we're addressing refugee lives as they exist.
There are no classes.
There are no lectures.
There are no due dates.
There are no final exams.
This degree is competency-based and not time-bound.
You choose when you start your project.
You choose how you're going to approach it.
NDD: When you open the platform, that's where you can see the goals.
Under each goal, we can find projects.
When you open a project, you get the competencies that you have to master, directions and overview of the project.
CR: The secret sauce of SNHU is combining that competency-based online learning with the in-person learning that we do with partners to provide all the wraparound supports.
That includes academic coaching.
It means psychosocial support, medical support, and it's also that back-end employment support that's really resulting in the 95 percent graduation, the 88 percent employment.
NDD: I'm a social media management intern.
It's related to the communications degree I'm doing.
I've learned so many things out of the project and in the real world.
CR: The structured internship is really an opportunity for students to practice their skills, for us to create connections between that internship and a later job opportunity.
(Music) This is a model that really stops putting time and university policies and procedures at the center and instead puts the student at the center.
IM: The SNHU model is a big way to shake the tree. Huge. It's a huge shake to the traditional way of having tertiary education here.
BDY: It can transform the lives of students from these vulnerable and refugee communities.
NDD: If I get the degree, I can just come back and work everywhere that I want.
I can go for a masters confidently in English, which is something that I would not have dreamt of before.
And I have the confidence and the skills required to actually go out and just tackle the workplace without having to fear that I can't make it.
SAS: I always wanted to work with the community.
I want to establish a nonprofit.
We advocate for women's education.
I want to be someone who is, like, an ambassador and encourage them to learn and tell them it is never too late.
It's a dream.Saida Aden Said: I still have this horrific image in my mind.
I could see people falling down, gunshots.
I was so terrified.
Really, I was crying a lot.
Someone who knew my father and my mom grabbed my hand, and he said, "Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!
" And I was like, "Where's my mom?
My mom? My mom?

It's a dream.
So I'd like to start, if I may, by asking you some questions.
If you've ever lost someone you truly love, ever had your heart broken, ever struggled through an acrimonious divorce, or been the victim of infidelity, please stand up.
If standing up isn't accessible to you, you can put your hand up.
Please, stay standing, and keep your hand up there.
Look around you. Adversity doesn't discriminate.
If you are alive, you are going to have to, or you've already had to, deal with some tough times.
Thank you, everyone, take a seat.
I started studying resilience research a decade ago, at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
It was an amazing time to be there, because the professors who trained me had just picked up the contract to train all 1.1 million American soldiers to be as mentally fit as they always have been physically fit.
As you can imagine, you don't get a much more skeptical discerning audience than the American drill sergeants returning from Afganistan.
So for someone like me, whose main quest in life is trying to work out how we take the best of scientific findings out of academia and bring them to people in their everyday lives, it was a pretty inspiring place to be.
I finished my studies in America, and I returned home here to Christchurch to start my doctoral research.
I'd just begun that study when the Christchurch earthquakes hit.
So I put my research on hold, and I started working with my home community to help them through that terrible post-quake period.
Instead of being the resilience expert, suddenly, I'm the grieving mother.
Waking up not knowing who I am, trying to wrap my head around unthinkable news, my world smashed to smithereens.
Suddenly, I'm the one on the end of all this expert advice. And I can tell you, I didn't like what I heard one little bit.
In the days after Abi died, we were told we were now prime candidates for family estrangement.
That we were likely to get divorced and we were at high risk of mental illness. "Wow," I remember thinking, "Thanks for that, I though my life was already pretty shit.
" (Laughter) Leaflets described the five stages of grief: anger, bargaining, denial, depression, acceptance.
Victim support arrived at our door and told us that we could expect to write off the next five years to grief.
I know the leaflets and the resources meant well. But in all of that advice, they left us feeling like victims.
Totally overwhelmed by the journey ahead, and powerless to exert any influence over our grieving whatsoever.
I didn't need to be told how bad things were.
Believe me, I already knew things were truly terrible.
What I needed most was hope. I needed a journey through all that anguish, pain and longing. Most of all, I wanted to be an active participant in my grief process.
So I decided to turn my back on their advice and decided instead to conduct something of a self-experiment.
I'd done the research, I had the tools, I wanted to know how useful they would be to me now in the face of such an enormous mountain to climb.
Now, I have to confess at this point, I didn't really know that any of this was going to work.
Parental bereavement is widely acknowledged as the hardest of losses to bear.
But I can tell you now, five years on, what I already knew from the research. That you can rise up from adversity, that there are strategies that work, that it is utterly possible to make yourself think and act in certain ways that help you navigate tough times.
There is a monumental body of research on how to do this stuff.
Today, I'm just going to share with you three strategies. These are my go-to strategies that I relied upon and saved me in my darkest days.
They're three strategies that underpin all of my work, and they're pretty readily available to us all, anyone can learn them, you can learn them right here today.
So number one, resilient people get that shit happens.
They know that suffering is part of life. This doesn't mean they actually welcome it in, they're not actually delusional.
Just that when the tough times come, they seem to know that suffering is part of every human existence. And knowing this stops you from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come. Never once did I find myself thinking, "Why me?
" In fact, I remember thinking, "Why not me?
Terrible things happen to you, just like they do everybody else.
That's your life now, time to sink or swim.
Number two, resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where they select their attention.
They have a habit of realistically appraising situations, and typically, managing to focus on the things that they can change, and somehow accept the things that they can't. This is a vital, learnable skill for resilience.
As humans, we are really good at noticing threats and weaknesses. We are hardwired for that negative. We're really, really good at noticing them. Negative emotions stick to us like Velcro, whereas positive emotions and experiences seems to bounce off like Teflon.
Choose life, not death.Don't lose what you have to what you have lost." In psychology, we call this benefit finding. In my brave new world, it involved trying to find things to be grateful for.
This was my go-to question in the days after the girls died.
Would that help me or would it harm me?
" Well, that was a no-brainer for me, I chose to stay away.
But Trevor, my husband, decided to meet with the driver at a later time. Late at night, I'd find myself sometimes poring over old photos of Abi, getting more and more upset.
Is the way I'm thinking and acting helping or harming you, in your bid to get that promotion, to pass that exam, to recover from a heart attack?
There's a sense of distance now unlike ever before.
To get you there, let's go back to the beginning.
As a kid growing up in a council estate in Southeast London, I was an outsider.
And I've learned very well how to follow it.
So I left London and I moved to Japan, where I didn't experience people asking me where I was really from.
I was just another gaijin, which, ironically, means "outsider.
Tokyo hadn't wronged me in any way.
I could no longer create with anger or out of pain.
It's like the world with all its positive and negative spaces could now be seen.
This is when I began to truly ask myself, "Who are you?
I followed the line.
When I got to New York, I didn't want to play by the rules of the art world.
I continued my practice as an outsider.
I kept drawing.
Curiosity became the ink for my pen, and I continued to dive deeper.
Over time, I began to create a bold, confident space for myself, a space that was all my own.
Initially, it was just my bedroom.
But that bedroom ended up in "The New York Times," and suddenly, I was being seen and known for this world I had created.
Since then, I've created and collaborated with some of the most unique artists, institutions and spaces, from the screens of Times Square, to the New York City Ballet for their incredible artist series, where I interviewed a number of dancers.
Their stories and words became the foundation of over 30 drawings and artworks, which took over the promenade walls, windows and floors.
For a long time, I wanted to create a space for contemplation and poetry.
And in 2019, I was given the opportunity to do just that by the Trust of Governor's Island.
They provided me with the perfect canvas in the form of a former military chapel.
Meet "The May Room.
" With drawings on the exterior inspired by the history of the island, you walk inside, you take your shoes off, and there's a drawing on the floor in the form of a maze that brings you back to you.
It's an invitation to become calm.
And this allows you to see phrases on the wall.
"May you be wise.
" "May you sleep soundly at night.
" "May we save trees.
" "May you," "may you," "may we.
" And these phrases seem like they're rising from you or falling into you.
I've let my lines become much like a language, a language that has unfolded much like life.
And when there has been silence, I've sought connection through conversation, asking questions to push through the discomfort.
Drawing has taught me how to create my own rules.
It has taught me to open my eyes to see not only what is, but what can be.
And where there are broken systems, we can create new ones that actually function and benefit all, instead of just a select few.
Drawing has taught me how to fully engage with the world.
And what I've come to realize through this language of lines is not the importance of being seen, but rather the gift of seeing that we give to others and how true freedom is the ability to see.
And I don't mean that literally, because sight is only one way in which one can see.
But what I mean is to experience the world in its entirety, maybe even more so during the most challenging moments like the one we face today.
I'm Shantell Martin.
I draw.
And I invite you to pick up a pen and see where it takes you.
(Music)So here we are.
I'm at home, as I'm sure many of you are, too.
And we've all begun to understand how our relationship with ourselves, with each other and the spaces we exist in can deeply impact our sense of identity and purpose.
So much has dramatically changed.
There's a sense of distance now unlike ever before.
And all it would take is a simple pen.
To get you there, let's go back to the beginning.
As a kid growing up in a council estate in Southeast London, I was an outsider.
I'm the oldest of six kids, and all of my siblings look very English: blond hair, blue eyes, very cute.
And then there was me: half Nigerian, brown, with an Afro.
So what happens when you look different and you feel different, and in many ways, start to think differently from everyone and everything around you?
How do you find your way out of a dark, racist, homophobic and very lonely place?
This is where the pen comes in.
I started to draw.
So as you can see, I've got this pen, and it knows where it's going.
And I've learned very well how to follow it.
And the first thing I did is I followed this line, and I drew myself out of a culture that was only telling me what I couldn't do.
I trusted my pen, and it led me to Central Saint Martin's, a very fancy art school in London, where I graduated top of my year.
However, I soon realized there wasn't a place for me in London, because whether you wish to believe it or not, England is still a country that is rooted and functions within the class system.
And as a young, black, gay female artist from a working-class family, I didn't stand a chance.
So I left London and I moved to Japan, where I didn't experience people asking me where I was really from.
I was just another gaijin, which, ironically, means "outsider.
" I was immersed in a culture that honors both making and craft, where people perfect their craft over generations.
It's a culture that masters both time and space, so that artists can truly create with freedom.
And what I discovered was a place I wasn't angry with.
Tokyo hadn't wronged me in any way.
I could no longer create with anger or out of pain.
I had to bravely allow myself to create from a different place.
And what I found is this incredible tool transcended a line on paper.
I found this thing that connected my head to my heart and my hand to everything.
I could see the world in new ways.
I found connections in corners and the solutions to problems I never knew existed.
It's like the world with all its positive and negative spaces could now be seen.
And just by seeing it, there was no longer any fear.
It's like my pen was a flashlight, and the unknown was still there, but it wasn't scary.
After five years of living in Japan and focusing on my craft, I felt like I needed a new challenge.
So I moved to New York, because that's what you do as an artist, right?
You move to the greatest city in the world that has the ability to make you feel completely and utterly invisible.
This is when I began to truly ask myself, "Who are you?
" I would wake up in the morning, and before I began my day, I would meditate on this.
And with this question in mind, I kept drawing.
I followed the line.
I let it lead the way.
The process of picking up a pen, something everyone has access to, the act of giving myself permission to let go of all thoughts, all fears, insecurities -- anything that would get in the way of allowing myself to be completely me -- that became my way of experiencing freedom.
When I got to New York, I didn't want to play by the rules of the art world.
I continued my practice as an outsider.
I kept drawing.
Curiosity became the ink for my pen, and I continued to dive deeper.
Over time, I began to create a bold, confident space for myself, a space that was all my own.
Initially, it was just my bedroom.
But that bedroom ended up in "The New York Times," and suddenly, I was being seen and known for this world I had created.
Since then, I've created and collaborated with some of the most unique artists, institutions and spaces, from the screens of Times Square, to the New York City Ballet for their incredible artist series, where I interviewed a number of dancers.
Their stories and words became the foundation of over 30 drawings and artworks, which took over the promenade walls, windows and floors.
For a long time, I wanted to create a space for contemplation and poetry.
And in 2019, I was given the opportunity to do just that by the Trust of Governor's Island.
They provided me with the perfect canvas in the form of a former military chapel.
Meet "The May Room.
" With drawings on the exterior inspired by the history of the island, you walk inside, you take your shoes off, and there's a drawing on the floor in the form of a maze that brings you back to you.
It's an invitation to become calm.
And this allows you to see phrases on the wall.
"May you be wise.
" "May you sleep soundly at night.
" "May we save trees.
" "May you," "may you," "may we.
" And these phrases seem like they're rising from you or falling into you.
I've let my lines become much like a language, a language that has unfolded much like life.
And when there has been silence, I've sought connection through conversation, asking questions to push through the discomfort.
Drawing has taught me how to create my own rules.
It has taught me to open my eyes to see not only what is, but what can be.
And where there are broken systems, we can create new ones that actually function and benefit all, instead of just a select few.
Drawing has taught me how to fully engage with the world.
And what I've come to realize through this language of lines is not the importance of being seen, but rather the gift of seeing that we give to others and how true freedom is the ability to see.
And I don't mean that literally, because sight is only one way in which one can see.
But what I mean is to experience the world in its entirety, maybe even more so during the most challenging moments like the one we face today.
I'm Shantell Martin.
I draw.
And I invite you to pick up a pen and see where it takes you.
(Music)
Alright. I have a close, tight-knit circle of friends.
We're all in different cities and we're all in different areas, from local news to city government to law, financial services . . . And despite those different areas, we seem to share similar stories of workplace drama.
Now, I define workplace drama as an annoyance that adds additional stress to the job.
So again, it's when people get on your nerves, not the job itself.
So as we're going through these stories, I'm realizing there has to be a better way for us to coexist with our coworkers without this much drama.
So I created a few steps that have been working for me, and I'm happy to share them with you guys today. Step 1: rewind and reflect, also known as, "What did I do?
" I want you guys to all replay your most recent workplace drama situation in your head like a movie. Ignore all of the emotion and just focus on you.
But for now, let's just think about this hypothetical: say you're on a group project, you each have your own individual assignments and then you all divide up the work.
But then someone becomes unresponsive -- not answering calls, they go ghost.
Then you or someone else has to now pick up that additional slack.
So in a brief, small, very tiny lapse in judgment, you vent to the nearby coworker.
Then all of a sudden, your ghost comes back, and they surprisingly know everything you just said.
(Laughter) Now, what did I do in this situation?
I vented to someone who was not my confidant.
Why would I do that?
Sometimes we create this unspoken bond with people that only exists in our heads.
They don't owe me their discretion. I just assumed it was there.
So we're not going to go down a rabbit hole, trying to figure out why they did that.
It doesn't matter.
They did it.
But the goal in this step is self-reflection.
We need to focus on what did we do so we can avoid it in the future.
Step 2: come back to reality, also known as, "It needs to stop. " (Laughter) So you guys ever think about problems before you get to work?
Oh -- it's just me?
(Laughter) Well, I'm guilty of it.
I think about all of these situations in my head, and then I get mad just thinking about it.
So I'm telling myself, "No, you're just being prepared, Stacy.
" (Laughter) "You are just making sure that you can handle whatever they're about to throw at you.
" But you're not.
What you're really doing is setting yourself up and creating this anxiety in your head that doesn't exist.
Then we also have to be careful about listening to other people's made-up scenarios.
Here's what I mean.
Let's say you're in the break room, and you're talking to some coworkers.
Then, all of a sudden, another coworker comes in.
Now, they seem to just be in deep thought -- not overly cheerful, but they're not rude.
They come in, they walk out.
Then the coworkers over here begin to diagnose what they feel is wrong with that person.
They're saying things like, "Oh, they're just mad they didn't get the job.
" Or they're saying, "Oh, no, no, no -- during this season, they're just always upset.
" And you're sitting here like, yep, that must be it.
You're listening to this as if this is facts.
Meanwhile, this coworker can be in deep thought about literally anything.
They could have just opened a pack of Starburst, got four yellows back-to-back, and they're just trying to figure out what happened.
(Laughter) (Applause) But you're over here listening.
And you're listening to their made-up scenario that now can impact how you choose to interact with that person throughout the day.
Whether we're creating fake stories in our head or listening to other people's made-up stories, it needs to stop.
The goal in this step: stop stressing over things that haven't happened. Alright. Step 3: vent and release.
It's good to have a vent buddy.
This is not like that person in Step 1 that just happened to be in earshot.
You have an established relationship with your vent buddy.
Now, here's another scenario.
You're getting ready to tell a customer or a client something that they just don't want to hear.
So, as you're in the middle of this spiel, up comes another coworker, and they interrupt you and then says the exact same thing you were saying.
You can't make a scene in front of a customer.
So you just have to sit back, "Mm-hmm," and just listen as they do this.
And you're burning up inside. So what do we do?
We go to our vent buddy.
We talk about it.
We get mad.
And that's the time for that.
Get mad.
Get angry.
Curse, scream, do whatever you need to do to get it out.
I truly believe in positive and negative energy, and it has a way of controlling our moods throughout the day.
You've got to think of things like, "OK, where do I go from here?
What can I do differently?
Now, the other hard part: you have to then apply those learnings to the situation.
Pattern behavior is harder to ignore than a one-off situation.
The goal in this step is, "Let's turn our vent session into a productive conversation.
" Step 4: learn a new language, also known as, "We need to talk.
" Guys, I personally don't like to pick up the phone at work.
I read emails the same way I speak, so I'm pretty sure I've misinterpreted some tones before, unless I know you.
So here's an example.
I'm going to show you guys an email, and I want you to read it, and then I'm going to read it out loud.
Alright, that was fast enough, you should have read it.
(Laughter) "Stacy, Thank you for reaching out about my group.
At this time, we will not need any additional support.
Per my last email (attached below), I've outlined what I do, and what you do, so we can avoid this in the future.
! " Guys . . . (Laughter) That's how you read it?
(Laughter) Guys, there are certain words in there that if you hear or if you see in an email, it is safe to assume they typed it with their middle fingers.
You have to know when it is time to have a face-to-face.
They are difficult, but they are necessary.
We all have our experiences.
And we all have our own communication styles.
As the new generations are entering the workforce, we're also adapting to it.
" So you're kind of side-eyeing them because they've burned you before, but you've had the "we need to talk," so you're like, "We're in sync now, I'm going to trust them.
Again, we can't make a scene in front of people, right?
" (Laughter) Yeah.
They're testing you now.
This is a repeat offender.
Don't try to figure out why they would do this, and no more coming-to-Jesus conversations.
" And they describe it as some elegant path of righteousness filled with rainbows and unicorns.
And as you're traveling down this amazing high road, you see billboards of things you shoulda said and things you shoulda did.
And for that reason, there will always be workplace drama.
(Applause)Alright. I have a close, tight-knit circle of friends.
" I want you guys to all replay your most recent workplace drama situation in your head like a movie. Ignore all of the emotion and just focus on you.
But then someone becomes unresponsive -- not answering calls, they go ghost.
Sometimes we create this unspoken bond with people that only exists in our heads.
Step 2: come back to reality, also known as, "It needs to stop. " (Laughter) So you guys ever think about problems before you get to work?
" But you're not.
It's good to have a vent buddy.
This is your coach, your cheerleader, your therapist, whatever you need them to be in the moment.
This is not like that person in Step 1 that just happened to be in earshot.
You have an established relationship with your vent buddy.
Now, here's another scenario.
You're getting ready to tell a customer or a client something that they just don't want to hear.
So, as you're in the middle of this spiel, up comes another coworker, and they interrupt you and then says the exact same thing you were saying.
You can't make a scene in front of a customer.
So you just have to sit back, "Mm-hmm," and just listen as they do this.
And you're burning up inside. So what do we do?
We go to our vent buddy.
We talk about it.
We get mad.
And that's the time for that.
Get mad.
Get angry.
Curse, scream, do whatever you need to do to get it out.
Now here's the hard part: you then have to switch that tone to positivity.
I truly believe in positive and negative energy, and it has a way of controlling our moods throughout the day.
You've got to think of things like, "OK, where do I go from here?
What can I do differently?
" And then, if you're the vent buddy, it's your responsibility to lead your friend back to the positive.
Now, the other hard part: you have to then apply those learnings to the situation.
You can't carry that resentment around. If you do, that one-off situation now becomes a pattern.
Pattern behavior is harder to ignore than a one-off situation.
The goal in this step is, "Let's turn our vent session into a productive conversation.
" Step 4: learn a new language, also known as, "We need to talk.
" Guys, I personally don't like to pick up the phone at work.
I just don't.
I feel like whatever you need to say to me can be an instant message or an email. That is my work language.
(Laughter) The only problem with that, you can't hear tone through an email.
I read emails the same way I speak, so I'm pretty sure I've misinterpreted some tones before, unless I know you.
So here's an example.
I'm going to show you guys an email, and I want you to read it, and then I'm going to read it out loud.
Alright, that was fast enough, you should have read it.
(Laughter) "Stacy, Thank you for reaching out about my group.
At this time, we will not need any additional support.
Going forward, if I feel we need help, I'll ask, you won't have to reach out.
Per my last email (attached below), I've outlined what I do, and what you do, so we can avoid this in the future.
As always, thank you for your partnership!
! " Guys . . . (Laughter) That's how you read it?
We all have our own upbringings.
" So here's my last scenario from one of my teacher friends.
Don't try to figure out why they would do this, and no more coming-to-Jesus conversations.
You now recognize that.
So that way, you can act accordingly.
We typically try to set expectations -- our expectations -- on other people, and then get disappointed when they don't follow through.
We have to learn to accept people where they are and adjust ourselves to handle those situations.
The goal in this step is to recognize when it is time to professionally walk away from someone.
Guys, I realize these steps may come off as saying, "Take the high road.
" And people always say it.
"Just take the high road.
" And they describe it as some elegant path of righteousness filled with rainbows and unicorns.
It's not that.
It's embarrassing. It's humiliating.
It leaves this knot of resentment in the pit of your stomach.
And as you're traveling down this amazing high road, you see billboards of things you shoulda said and things you shoulda did.
You go over there and you look at the easy road, and they're chillin', not worried about a thing.
But I have to admit, the more I travel down this road, it does get a little easier.
Petty situations, they don't bother me as much.
I learn little nuggets here and there.
And as I continue down this path, there seem to be more opportunities waiting for me.
I have like-minded people who want to connect with me, projects that people want me on, leaders reaching out because they heard about me through someone else.
And the best part?
The need to even look at the easy road is no longer there.
Guys, we're not going to change the way adults act in the workplace.
We are not.
And for that reason, there will always be workplace drama.
But if we stick to these steps and put in the work that comes with it, we can learn to avoid it.
Guys, thank you for being my vent buddies.
(Laughter) And thank you so much for your time.
(Applause)
At the temple of the fisherman, Quexo, the village shaman, looks out over the ocean and frowns.
It’s a still morning– unusually still, and the lack of wind is the latest in a series of troubling signs.
The year is 1400 BCE. Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, treeless desert between the towering Andes and Pacific Ocean.
The villagers live off the sea, harvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, and using them to build fishing boats.
Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats to hunt shark and other fish while the women harvest shellfish and sea urchins.
In winter, storms bring powerful waves, which cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores.
Most years, Quexo’s village catches more than enough fish.
But this year, the winds have died and the fish have dwindled.
Quexo has seen this pattern before: the fish disappear, then the violent rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve mud bricks and wash away settlements.
He needs to stop the bad weather before the storms come— his only hope is a special ritual he’s been planning.
Quexo spends much less time in the ocean than the other villagers.
He became a shaman after seeing a sign in the sea one morning— like his father and grandfather before him.
This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain as the sun rises.
There, he gathers ceremonial cactus and herbs like “horse tail,” “stonebreaker," and valerian, along with the mineral hematite.
Back in the village, everyone is preparing to leave for a religious festival at a large temple inland.
The festival marks the beginning of what is usually the season of abundance, but with the signs pointing to storms, Quexo isn’t feeling too celebratory.
Whole families travel to the festival, where they camp for a few days.
They’ve packed seaweed, carved bones, gourd bowls, reed mats, and other goods to trade in the market around the temple.
Quexo inspects the goods to make sure everything is of the finest quality.
He brings the herbs he gathered to trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes from the highlands in the Andes.
He needs cinnabar for his ritual to ward off the storms.
Around lunchtime, the sprawling temple rises out of the desert ahead.
People have come from all along the coast and the foothills.
The women handle trade transactions— they’re looking for cotton and ceramics.
Men aren’t usually allowed to do the trading, but shamans are an exception.
Though Quexo is a man, during rituals he becomes half man, half woman, and this ambiguity makes his role more flexible outside ceremonies too.
Quexo can’t find any cinnabar in the market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza.
He puts on his ceremonial garb: red face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth and vertebrae.
Inside, the ceremonies are already underway, and the shamans have drunk the sacred cactus drink.
Many of them are Quexo’s friends from festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans who would have cinnabar.
He begins to panic.
If the highland shamans don’t show up, his only option will be to make the long walk into the mountains.
It’s a dangerous journey that takes five days, precious time he doesn’t have to waste.
But perhaps he has no choice.
He refuses the sacred cactus and sets off toward the mountains.
As he leaves the settlement behind, he sees a group approaching.
He recognizes them as highlanders by their llamas.
He dashes toward their shaman.
Barely pausing to say hello, he offers him hematite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime and chew with coca leaves.
In return, the other shaman gives him the precious cinnabar.
With the key to his ritual in hand, Quexo heads home to the temple of the fisherman in hopes of turning the tide.At the temple of the fisherman, Quexo, the village shaman, looks out over the ocean and frowns.

I arrived in the US from Kingston, Jamaica in the summer of '68. My family of six crammed into a small, two-bedroom apartment in a three-story walk-up in Brooklyn.
The block had several children -- some spoke Spanish, some spoke English.
Initially, I wasn't allowed to play with them because, as my parents said, "Them too rambunctious" -- (Laughter) so I could only watch them from my window.
Rollerskating was one of their favorite activities.
They loved hitching a ride at the back of the city bus, letting go of the rear bumper as the bus arrived at the bottom of the block in front of my building.
One day there was a new girl with them.
I heard the usual squeals of laughter interspersed with, "Mira, mira! Mira, mira! " Spanish for, "Look, look!
" The group grabbed onto the back of the bus at the top of the block, and as they rolled down laughing and screaming, "Mira, mira, mira, mira," the bus abruptly stopped.
The experienced riders adjusted and quickly let go, but the new girl lurched back and fell onto the pavement.
She didn't move.
The adults outside ran to help her. The bus driver came out to see what had happened and call for an ambulance.
There was blood coming from her head.
She didn't open her eyes.
We waited for the ambulance, and waited, and everyone said, "Where is the ambulance?
Where is the ambulance?
" The police finally arrived.
An older black American man said, "Ain't no ambulance coming.
" He said it again loudly to the cop. "You know ain't no ambulance coming. They never send no ambulance here.
" The cop looked at my neighbors who were getting frustrated, lifted the girl into the patrol car and left.
I was 10 years old at the time. I knew this wasn't right.
I knew there was something more we could do.
The something I could do was become a doctor.
I became an internist and committed my career to caring for those we often call the underserved, the vulnerable, like those neighbors I had when I first immigrated to America.
During my early training years in Harlem in the '80s, I saw a shocking increase in young men with HIV.
Then when I moved [to] Miami, I noticed HIV included women and children, primarily, poor black and brown people.
Within a few years, an infection seen in a select population became a worldwide epidemic.
Again I got the urge to do something.
Fortunately, with the help of activists and advocates and educators and physicians like me who treat the disease, we found a way forward.
There was a massive education effort to reduce HIV transmission and provide legal protection for those with the disease.
There was a political will to make sure that as many patients as possible worldwide, regardless of ability to pay, could get access to medication.
Within a couple of decades there were new treatments that transformed this life-threatening infection to a chronic disease, like diabetes.
Now there's a vaccine on the horizon.
Over the last five to seven years, I've noticed a different epidemic among the patients in Florida, and it looks something like this. Ms. Anna Mae, a retired clerical worker living on a fixed income in Opa-locka, walked in for medication refills.
She had common chronic conditions of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and asthma with overlapping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -- COPD. Ms. Anna Mae was one of my more adherent patients, so I was surprised she needed refills of her breathing medicines earlier than usual.
Towards the end of the visit, she handed me a Florida Power and Light form and asked me to sign it. She was behind on her light bill.
This form allowed physicians to document serious medical conditions requiring equipment that would be impacted if the patient's electricity was disconnected.
"But Ms. Anna Mae," I said, "you don't use any medical devices for breathing.
I don't think you qualify.
" Further questioning revealed she had been using her air conditioner day and night because of the heat so she could breathe.
Needing to buy more asthma inhalers left her little money; she couldn't pay all the bills so it piled up.
I filled out the form, but knowing she might be denied, I also sent her to the social worker.
Then there was Jorge, such a sweet, kind man who often gifted our clinic with some of the fruits he sold on the streets of Miami.
He had signs of worsening kidney function whenever he worked days on end on those hot streets due to dehydration -- just not enough blood getting to the kidneys.
His kidneys worked much better whenever he took some days off. But with no other support, what could he do?
As he says, "Rain or shine, cold or heat, I have to work.
" But the most damning case of all may be Ms. Sandra Faye Twiggs of Fort Lauderdale with COPD.
She was arrested after fighting with her daughter over a fan.
On her release from jail, she returned to her apartment, coughed nonstop and died three days later.
Here's what else I noticed: the data show allergy seasons are starting weeks earlier, nighttime temperatures are rising, trees are growing faster and mosquitos carrying dangerous diseases like Zika and dengue are showing up in areas they didn't exist before.
I also see signs of impending climate gentrification.
That's when richer people move into poorer neighborhoods that are at higher elevation and less subject to flood damage from climate change.
Like in my patient Madame Marie who came in stressed and anxious, because she was evicted from her apartment in Miami's Little Haiti to make room for a luxury apartment complex whose developers understood that Little Haiti would not flood because it's ten feet above sea level.
An undeniable, clear and consistent warming trend is on the way.A health emergency even bigger than HIV/AIDS seems to be in the works, and it was my low-income patients that were dropping clues of what this would look like.
This new epidemic is climate change, and it has a variety of health effects.
Climate change impacts us in four major ways. Directly, through heat, extreme weather and pollution; through the spread of the disease; through disruption of our food and water supply; and through disruption of our emotional well-being.
In medicine we use mnemonics to aid our memory, and this mnemonic, "heatwave," shows the eight significant health effects of climate change. H: Heat illnesses. E: Exacerbation of heart and lung disease. A: Asthma worsening.
T: Traumatic injuries, especially during extreme weather events.W: Water and foodborne illnesses. A: Allergies worsening. V: Vector-borne diseases spreading, like Zika, dengue and Lyme. And E: Emotional stresses increasing.
Poor, vulnerable people are already feeling the effects of climate change.
They are the proverbial canary in a coal mine.
Truly, their experiences are like oracles or prophecies.
The guiding light for us to pay attention that we are doing something to our world first that's hurting them first.
But in a matter of time, we are next.
If we act together -- doctors, patients and other health professionals -- we will find solutions.
We have done this with the HIV crisis.
There [it] was thanks to the activism of patients with HIV that demanded medications and better research, and the collaboration of doctors and scientists that we were able to control the epidemic.
And then it was thanks to international health agencies, NGOs, politicians and pharmaceutical companies that HIV medication became available in low-income countries.
There is no reason we can't also apply this model of collaboration to address the health effects of climate change before it's too late.
Climate change is here.
It's already damaging the health and homes of poor people.
Like my patient Jorge, most of us will have to work, whether rain or shine, cold or heat.
But together these patients and their doctors, hand-in-hand, with some basic tools, can do so much to make this climate transition less brutal for all of us.
These patients inspired me to found a clinicians' organization to fight climate change.
We focus on understanding the health effects of climate change, learning to advocate for patients with climate-related illnesses and encouraging real-world solutions.
A recent Gallup study showed three of the most respected professions are nurses, doctors and pharmacists.
So as respected members of society, we have amplified voices to influence climate change policy and politics.
There is so much we can do.
We can teach climate-related illnesses in our health-professional schools.
We can collect data on our patients' climate-related conditions by making sure there are billing codes to identify them.
We can do climate-related health research.
We can teach how to have green practices in homes.
We can advocate for our patient energy needs.
We can help them get safer homes.
We can help them get necessary equipment in those homes when conditions worsen.
We can testify in front of lawmakers as to the findings, and we can medically treat our patients' climate-related illnesses.
Most importantly, we can help prepare our patients mentally and physically for the health challenges they will face, using a model of medicine that incorporates economic and social justice.
This would mean Ms. Sandra Faye Twiggs with COPD, who died after being released from jail after a fight with her daughter over a fan, would have known that the heat in her apartment made her sick and angry and seek a safer place to go for cooling.
Even better, her apartment would never have been so hot.
From the poor, I've learned our lives are not only vulnerable but are stories of resilience, innovation and survival.
Like that wise old man who loudly spoke truth to the cop that summer night: "Ain't no ambulance coming," and compelled him to deliver that little girl to the hospital instead.
You know what?
Listen up.
If there's going to be a medical response to climate change, it is not going to be just waiting for an ambulance.
It is going to happen because we the clinicians take the first step.
We make so much noise that the issue cannot be ignored or misunderstood.
It is going to start with the stories our patients tell and the stories we tell on their behalf.
We're going to do what is right for our patients like we've always done, but also what is right for our environment, for ourselves and for all the people on this planet -- all of them.
Thank you.
(Applause and cheers)
I'm Dr.Julia Shaw, a research associate at University College London, and the cofounder of Spot. Spot is a tool that helps organizations tackle harassment and discrimination with better reporting options and better training. And in 2019, along with Dr. Camilla Elphick and Dr.
These things aren't happening behind closed doors.Further research has since come out which has further repeated this idea that most harassment and discrimination is witnessed.And so how do we mobilize these witnesses?
And they fall prey to the well-known bystander effect.Why? And what are the barriers that people are facing?
And the barriers that they cited?
The number one barrier was actually the exact same as the main barrier that victims report, which is the fear of consequences or retaliation.
Even witnesses are worried about what might happen to them and their careers.
Other reasons that people reported was not wanting to interfere or not wanting to be a snitch, not knowing they could report, or not knowing how.
All of these things can be targeted with better education and better systems in workplaces.
But the story of the witness isn't complete without also talking about the consequences for the witnesses themselves.
If you were to see someone who just witnessed a crime being committed on the street, you would almost certainly go up to that witness and say, "Are you OK?
Do you need some support?
" You might even offer them counseling or therapy to process what they just saw.
But witnesses at work are largely invisible.
" Most people said, "No, I'm fine.
" But when we looked at the qualitative entries, when we looked at what people actually wrote about this experience, we found that these experiences had profoundly negative impacts.
They increased stress and anxiety and depression, they increased the prevalence of desire to leave the organization, loss of faith.
Why is there this discrepancy?
It seems that we're doing a comparative evaluation.
"Compared to the victim, nothing really happened to me.
" But that's not really the right question.
And support shouldn't be invisible just because you're less affected.
Because we're all affected and we should all be supporting each other.
We also found evidence of a social contagion.
While 23 percent of participants told HR, more, 46 percent, told colleagues, usually someone on their team, and 67 percent told someone outside of work.
What this shows is that the negative consequences of the situation, where someone is harassed or discriminated against, go far beyond the room.
People take that story with them and that discontent grows as they tell more and more people, and this has the real effect that is almost certainly threatening your ability as an organization to retain and attract diverse and excellent candidates.
So what do we do to stop this social contagion?
What do we do to reduce these barriers and how do we provide support for witnesses and victims?
How can we be better allies?
And it's easier than you might think.
In my research, I've come across five particular things that I think every organization can and should do to help tackle this issue and to build healthier workplaces.
First, showcase your commitment.
If your leadership isn't repeatedly saying how important diversity and inclusion is to them, and living by example, no one is going to believe you.
An HR-driven campaign is insufficient.
Your organization is a direct mirror of its leadership team, and they need to be setting the tone.
Second, train your managers.
The main person who's likely to harass someone in your organization is a manager.
Now, why?
Perhaps because power corrupts, or perhaps because we promote people into managerial roles because they're excellent at their jobs, and we assume that they will pick up the people skills, pick up the management skills along the way.
But then they don't.
And this provides a fertile ground for harassment and discrimination with unrealistic expectations, with poor time management, with poor conflict management skills.
Train your managers.
Third, we know from research on victims that without the ability to report anonymously, the fear of consequences is so overwhelming that most people will never report incidents.
We found the same was true for witnesses. When we asked them directly, in our study, whether organizations could do something to improve the fact that they might report, they said, number one that they could do better was allowing for witness anonymity.
Second was providing choices about who to report to.
Perhaps shockingly, although managers are the most likely person to be perpetrating harassment or discrimination, in many organizations they're also supposed to be your first point of contact when things go wrong.
Now that's a major sticking point.
So being able to choose who you go to is crucial.
Third, encouraging witness reporting. Back to setting a tone in your organization, saying you can and should report things, and you can help stand up for each other.
Fourth, even when you have all of this in place, most people will not speak to HR.
We know this, because at Spot, we though anonymity would solve everything.
It did not.
Anonymity is one piece of the puzzle.
Conducting surveys means that you go out to your employees, you don't wait for them to come to you.
And you ask everybody about how they feel about the health of inclusion and diversity efforts within the organization.
And be specific.
Ask people about specific incidents or specific things they've witnessed.
Because just like in our survey, if you ask people directly if they have experienced harassment or discrimination, the default answer is no.
But if you ask about specific experiences or specific behaviors, most people go, "Oh, yeah, I saw that the other week.
" So making sure you ask the right questions is crucial.
Finally, and most importantly, research shows that one of the best ways to mitigate the bystander effect is to build a shared social identity.
It's not about policing each other, it's not about calling each other out, it's about being a cohesive unit.
We are in this together.
If you attack one of us, you are attacking all of us.
Because wouldn't you want that?
Wouldn't you want someone to stand by you if something negative happens?
We're all, hopefully, collectively building an organization that is stronger and healthier and more diverse and inclusive.
Without my allies, I wouldn't be here.
When I was first targeted with inappropriate behavior at work, I fell into a depression, and I almost left academia altogether.
But unfortunately, these individuals are still at it.
You see, in organizational structures where colleagues work in dispersed ways, where it's difficult to know who even to report to, never mind what the consequences might be, these kinds of behaviors are most likely to flourish for longer.
But that doesn't stop me from trying to stop it.
And I can tell you one thing -- that over the past couple of years of my research, I have found that there have been so many positive changes.
Changes in legislation, changes in attitudes, and organizations are finally taking these issues seriously. I swear, the time of the harassers and the bullies and the discriminators is coming to an end.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Consider this unfortunately familiar scenario.
Several months ago a highly infectious, sometimes deadly respiratory virus infected humans for the first time.
It then proliferated faster than public health measures could contain it.
Now the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a pandemic, meaning that it’s spreading worldwide.
The death toll is starting to rise and everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end?
The WHO will likely declare the pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained and rates of transmission drop significantly throughout the world.
But exactly when that happens depends on what global governments choose to do next.
They have three main options: Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, or Coordinate and Crush.
One is widely considered best, and it may not be the one you think.
In the first, governments and communities do nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed as quickly as possible.
Without time to study the virus, doctors know little about how to save their patients, and hospitals reach peak capacity almost immediately.
Somewhere in the range of millions to hundreds of millions of people die, either from the virus or the collapse of health care systems.
Soon the majority of people have been infected and either perished or survived by building up their immune responses.
Around this point herd immunity kicks in, where the virus can no longer find new hosts.
So the pandemic fizzles out a short time after it began.
But there’s another way to create herd immunity without such a high cost of life.
Let’s reset the clock to the moment the WHO declared the pandemic.
This time, governments and communities around the world slow the spread of the virus to give research facilities time to produce a vaccine.
They buy this crucial time through tactics that may include widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected and people they’ve interacted with, and physical distancing.
Even with these measures in place, the virus slowly spreads, causing up to hundreds of thousands of deaths.
Some cities get the outbreak under control and go back to business as usual, only to have a resurgence and return to physical distancing when a new case passes through.
Within the next several years, one or possibly several vaccines become widely, and hopefully freely, available thanks to a worldwide effort.
Once 40-90% of the population has received it— the precise amount varying based on the virus— herd immunity kicks in, and the pandemic fizzles out.
Let’s rewind the clock one more time, to consider the final strategy: Coordinate and Crush.
In a typical pandemic, when one country is peaking, another may be getting its first cases.
Instead of every leader responding to what’s happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world as the giant interconnected system it is.
If coordinated properly, this could end a pandemic in just a few months, with low loss of life.
But unless the virus is completely eradicated— which is highly unlikely— there will be risks of it escalating to pandemic levels once again.
And factors like animals carrying and transmitting the virus might undermine our best efforts altogether.
So which strategy is best for this deadly, infectious respiratory virus?
Racing through it is a quick fix, but would be a global catastrophe, and may not work at all if people can be reinfected.
Crushing the virus through Coordination alone is also enticing for its speed, but only reliable with true and nearly impossible global cooperation.
That’s why vaccination, assisted by as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner; it’s the slow, steady, and proven option in the race.
Even if the pandemic officially ends before a vaccine is ready, the virus may reappear seasonally, so vaccines will continue to protect people.
And although it may take years to create, disruptions to most people’s lives won’t necessarily last the full duration.
Breakthroughs in treatment and prevention of symptoms can make viruses much less dangerous, and therefore require less extreme containment measures.
Take heart: the pandemic will end.
Its legacy will be long-lasting, but not all bad; the breakthroughs, social services, and systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone.
And if we take inspiration from the successes and lessons from the failures, we can keep the next potential pandemic so contained that our children’s children won’t even know its name.
I grew up in a family where my father managed all of the money. But for some reason, when I was eight or nine years old, he started showing me things about money.
We would sit at the kitchen table, and he'd show me all the bank books.
Now, that was back in the day before the internet, when we used to have little books that we used to keep our information in.
And he would show me how he saved in these accounts, and he'd pay bills out of these.
" And to my surprise, he gave it to me. Right then, at 16 years old, I began managing my own money.
I went on to college and then to start my new career as a CPA, but now, with students loans, getting an apartment and a new job, I began the roller-coaster ride of accumulating debt, paying it off and accumulating more.
Many years later, after getting married, I went through an unexpected divorce, and I was left with a house I couldn't afford and bills I couldn't pay.
You might be wondering, "How does that happen to someone that's educated and skilled at managing people's money?
" I had reverted back to what I learned growing up: that one person managed all the money. I had handed over my financial power, and I had become financially dependent.
Someone is dependent with choice when they hand over their financial power and their participation.
It can happen in personal or business relationships when one person doesn't want to be involved with the money, so they hand over the responsibility to a spouse, a partner or a professional, like an accountant or a manager.
This was my situation.
I spent all day long managing other people's money, so I was relieved that my husband was interested and good at managing ours.
I was free!
For the first time since that first job at 16 years old, I didn't have to be responsible for managing my money. But what I failed to realize was what felt like freedom was really dependency.
Someone that's dependent without a choice feels trapped because of their financial situation.
They can be in a job or career where they're unhappy or being harassed but they can't afford to leave.
Or, someone that's had to move in with family and friends because they've had an illness or gone through a divorce or experienced a tragedy, and now they're financially dependent on others.
And how many of us know someone that has an elderly parent or a relative that can no longer take care of themselves, and they're left to rely on others, sometimes handing over their homes, their money and other assets.
Another type of dependency without a choice is financial abuse.
Financial abuse is a pattern of abusive behavior used to control and intimidate a partner.
Victims are in a relationship, and the other person has power over them, because they don't have access to money, information or the resources and support they need to leave.
Financial abuse and financial dependency leave emotional scars that you can't see. They include hopelessness, guilt, shame, depression, lack of confidence and self-esteem.
Financial dependency is also invisible, because no one's talking about it.
Why?
Because no one wants to show their emotional scars, and because we're taught in our homes, on our jobs and in our community not to talk about money.
So many people that I talk to about this issue, they can relate and they have a story, but they're not telling anyone their story.
When I was told at the kitchen table, "Don't you tell," I never told anyone. It's even hard for me right now to break that rule that I learned so long ago.
So, what can I do?
What can you do?
What can we all do to disarm this invisible weapon?
We can solve three problems.
The first problem is lack of awareness, because knowing about money and having money aren't always the solution.
In my situation, I was educated and experienced in managing money, but that didn't stop me from becoming financially dependent.
Why?
Because of the beliefs and experiences I had growing up: one person manages all the money.
After my divorce, I had to rebuild my life financially and emotionally.
In 2018, only 17 states required financial literacy in high school curriculums.
This corresponds with recent studies that show that 66 percent of Americans are financially illiterate.
If you are in a financial dependency situation, start by looking and going through your finances, making decisions, participate in making decisions about your money.
If you are in a financial abuse situation, get access to your information.
Look for financial documents like bank credit card statements, social security information and account pass codes.
The last problem is lack of giving and getting support.
Many people don't know that there are free resources online and in your local community to help you learn and establish healthy money habits.
There are also free resources if you are a victim of financial abuse, like the Purple Purse.
Giving support includes listening to others that are financially dependent without judgment or criticism.
It also involves sharing your story, because when you share your story, you empower others, and you give them the permission to rewrite their own.
It's my hope that by sharing my story, more people will learn about financial dependency, will share their own stories and will connect with others to shed a light on this hidden issue so that we can all have financial freedom.

You’re cruising down the highway when all of a sudden endless rows of brake lights appear ahead.
There’s no accident, no stoplight, no change in speed limit or narrowing of the road.
So why the @#$%!
is there so much traffic?
When traffic comes to a near standstill for no apparent reason, it’s called a phantom traffic jam.
A phantom traffic jam is an emergent phenomenon whose behavior takes on a life of its own, greater than the sum of its parts.
But in spite of this, we can actually model these jams, even understand the principles that shape them— and we’re closer than you might think to preventing this kind of traffic in the future.
For a phantom traffic jam to form, there must be a lot of cars on the road.
That doesn’t mean there are necessarily too many cars to pass through a stretch of roadway smoothly, at least not if every driver maintains the same consistent speed and spacing from other drivers.
In this dense, but flowing, traffic, it only takes a minor disturbance to set off the chain of events that causes a traffic jam.
Say one driver brakes slightly.
Each successive driver then brakes a little more strongly, creating a wave of brake lights that propagates backward through the cars on the road.
These stop-and-go waves can travel along a highway for miles.
With a low density of cars on the road, traffic flows smoothly because small disturbances, like individual cars changing lanes or slowing down at a curve, are absorbed by other drivers’ adjustments.
But once the number of cars on the road exceeds a critical density, generally when cars are spaced less than 35 meters apart, the system’s behavior changes dramatically.
It begins to display dynamic instability, meaning small disturbances are amplified.
Dynamic instability isn’t unique to phantom traffic jams— it’s also responsible for raindrops, sand dunes, cloud patterns, and more.
The instability is a positive feedback loop.
Above the critical density, any additional vehicle reduces the number of cars per second passing through a given point on the road.
This in turn means it takes longer for a local pileup to move out of a section of the road, increasing vehicle density even more, which eventually adds up to stop-and-go traffic.
Drivers tend not to realize they need to break far in advance of a traffic jam, which means they end up having to brake harder to avoid a collision.
This strengthens the wave of braking from vehicle to vehicle.
What’s more, drivers tend to accelerate too rapidly out of a slowdown, meaning they try to drive faster than the average flow of traffic downstream of them.
Then, they have to brake again, eventually producing another feedback loop that causes more stop-and-go traffic.
In both cases, drivers make traffic worse simply because they don’t have a good sense of the conditions ahead of them.
Self driving cars equipped with data on traffic conditions ahead from connected vehicles or roadway sensors might be able to counteract phantom traffic in real-time.
These vehicles would maintain a uniform speed, safety permitting, that matches the average speed of the overall flow, preventing traffic waves from forming.
In situations where there’s already a traffic wave, the automated vehicle would be able to anticipate it, braking sooner and more gradually than a human driver and reducing the strength of the wave.
And it wouldn’t take that many self-driving cars— In a recent experiment, one autonomous vehicle for every 20 human drivers was enough to dampen and prevent traffic waves.
Traffic jams are not only a daily annoyance– they’re a major cause of fatalities, wasted resources, and planet-threatening pollution.
But new technology may help reduce these patterns, rendering our roads safer, our daily commutes more efficient, and our air cleaner.
And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers aren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road conditions ahead— and drive accordingly.
As a child, I had many fears.
" She laughs and says, "Oh, precious, stand up. Say D-O-G. " And I respond, [In a Staten Island accent] "Dog?
Left untreated, anxiety in early childhood can lead to depression by adolescence.It can also contribute to substance abuse and to suicidality.My parents were not therapists.
They're five or six years of age."Nobody at school likes me!These kids are mean. No one would play with me. " How do you feel seeing your child so upset?
What do you do?
OK, how about some good news?
How threatening is it to my child?
And what do I ultimately want them to learn from it?
When you see your child suffering but you think you could swoop in and save them from the pain of it, that's everything, right?That's what we want to do.
Calmness and confidence are not just emotions.They are coping skills that parents and children can learn. Thank you. (Applause)
A mountain separating two lakes.
The lid of an immense snuffbox.
These seemingly unrelated images take us on a tour of a sperm whale’s head in Herman Melville’s "Moby Dick.
" On the surface, the book is the story of Captain Ahab’s hunt for revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale who bit off his leg.
But though the book features pirates, typhoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you shouldn’t expect a conventional seafaring adventure.
The narrator guiding us through these explorations is a common sailor called Ishmael.
Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp and drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea.
While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck tries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us on his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs.
He published "Moby Dick" in 1851, when the United States’ whaling industry was at its height.
Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away from the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whale’s perspective at one point, when he speculates on how terrifying the huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below.
Chapters with titles as unpromising as “Cistern and Buckets” become some of the novel’s most rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out a sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato.
Tangling whale-lines provoke witty reflections on the “ever-present perils” entangling all mortals.
He draws on diverse branches of knowledge, like zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and teachings from a range of religious and cultural traditions.
The book experiments with writing style as much as subject matter.
Through "Moby Dick’s" many pages, Melville invites his readers to leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt for the “ungraspable phantom of life. ”
We went back and forth, "What do you mean, what are you talking about?
This particular report lists the casualties from October of 2001 specifically to November 18 of last year.
So by my numbers, 115,000 approximate suicides, 5,440 killed in action.
That's something I think that needs to change.
Number two, when you leave the service -- When I left the service in 2003, I had to attend some mandatory classes, about two days' worth of classes, and then I was on my way.
Today, it's a little different.
Today you'll actually get a call if you're on what we call terminal leave or paid time off that you're trying to use up before you actually are fully discharged.
I talked to one veteran who got a call.
He was on his way home from work, and the only thing he could think of was, "How quick can I get off this?
" And I think the call lasted maybe 10 or 15 minutes.
But yet the national studies tell us it needs to be an in-person, one-hour interview.
I think that's something that we can improve upon.
There's another thing that the Department of Veteran Affairs talked about in the reports.
They said that our service members that are self-medicating tend to be at a significantly higher risk of suicide.
So those veterans that are self-medicating with alcohol, or drug abuse -- and in fact, the Department of Veteran Affairs has classified opioid use disorder, OUD, as one of the epidemics.
So as I talked to marines from my unit and tried to learn more about it, I started to find out some really, really alarming things.
I had a marine who came back from Iraq and he went to the hospital for a "back pain" and he was prescribed some opioids.
He also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.
He became addicted to these painkillers, because not only did it mask the pain in his back, but it helped him to cope with some of the horrific things that he had to see, experience and do over in the Middle East.
And he eventually overdosed.
Another challenge we have is that when you're on active duty, you are under the Department of Defense.
And so all of your doctors, all your health care is in that category.
When you leave the service, you are now part of the Department of Veteran Affairs.
Now there's some good news in this.
Just recently, it was legislated that a database will be built that will house both Department of Defense health records and Department of Veteran Affairs health records.
But I want to take that thought a step further.
My company was 204 marines and sailors strong.
As I looked at and I talked to my marines from my unit, what we came up with is we are well in excess of a dozen of our members that committed suicide.
When I talk to senior leadership in the battalion, and battalion is about six to seven hundred marines, they estimate that we're in the hundreds who have committed suicide.
So let's take this database that we're building, and let's go a little bit further with it.
If they're in theater, get them the mental health while they're in theater, and get them mental health counseling and help before they even come home out of theater.
(Applause) And by the way, if we can build those sets of data points to be able to do that, we don't just apply them to the military, we can also use that for the general population.
If we put our minds together and our resources together, and we openly talk about this, and try to find solutions for this epidemic that's going on in America, hopefully we can save a life.
Those are my thoughts, my ideas, I hope that this talk is not the end of this discussion but rather the beginning of it.
And I want to thank you for your time today.
(Applause)So on May 6 of 2019, the sun was shining, the sky was blue, clouds were that puffy white. It was a perfect spring day.
I was walking back to my office, and my phone rang.
And it was one of my lieutenants. I said, "Hey, John.
How are you?
" He said, "Sir, I'm good.
But I've got some bad news.
" He said our executive officer died that weekend.
We went back and forth, "What do you mean, what are you talking about?
" I asked him what happened.
" I walked around my office for a couple of hours in a complete fog, trying to understand what had happened, why.
I had just communicated with him a few months earlier.
And I had no idea that this officer was in trouble.
I went on this process of trying to figure out why, what's happening in the veteran community, why are these things going on.
Department of Veteran Affairs has taken the lead on veteran suicide, and it's actually their number one priority.
I also looked at the Department of Defense report that lists casualties.
This particular report lists the casualties from October of 2001 specifically to November 18 of last year.
During that time frame and the Global War on Terror, there have been 5,440 active duty members killed in action.
What does that mean to me?
We have approximately 21 veterans ending their lives by their own hand for every one that is killed by an enemy combatant.
It's a staggering, staggering number.
Today you'll actually get a call if you're on what we call terminal leave or paid time off that you're trying to use up before you actually are fully discharged.
I talked to one veteran who got a call.
He was on his way home from work, and the only thing he could think of was, "How quick can I get off this?

Thirty years ago, I walked into a nursing home, and my life changed forever. I was there to visit my grandmother Alice.
She was a very powerful woman who had lost a battle with a stroke that stole her ability to speak.
Alice had just three forms of communication left.
She had this sound that was like, "tss, tss, tss," that she could shift in tone from emphatic, "no, no, no," to enticing, "yes, you've almost got it.
" She had an incredibly expressive index finger, which she could shake and point with frustration.
And she had these enormous pale blue eyes that she could open and close for emphasis.
Wide open seemed to say, "Yes, you've almost got it," and closing slowly was -- well, it didn't really need much translation.
It turns out that Alice had taught me that everyone has a story.
Everyone has a story.
The challenge for the listener is how to invite it into being, and how to really hear it.
Now, Alzheimer's and dementia, these are two words that, when you say them in front of people, you can watch a cloud descend over them.
You can imagine me at dinner parties.
"What do you do? " "Well, I invite people with Alzheimer's and dementia into expression. Where are you going?
Science is pushing for treatments, dreaming of cures, but loosening that grip of stigma and fear could ease the pain of so many people right now. And luckily, meaningful connection doesn't take a pill.
It takes reaching out. It takes listening.
And it takes a dose of wonder.That really has become my unending quest, set in motion by Alice and then later on by really countless elders in nursing homes and day centers and those struggling to stay at home.
And it comes down to the question of how. How do you meaningfully connect?
I didn't know.
Family members, when they try to connect, most commonly will invoke a shared past.
I call them beautiful questions. A beautiful question is one that opens a shared path of discovery.
With no right or wrong answer, a beautiful question helps us shift away from the expectation of memory into the freedom of imagination, a thousand possible responses for people with cognitive challenges.
Now, back in the kitchen, I did know one thing about Jim. I knew that he liked to walk along Lake Michigan, and when I looked around that kitchen, I saw, over by the stove, this trunk that was just covered in little pieces of driftwood.
And I thought, "I'll try a question that he could answer without words. " So I tried, "Jim, can you show me how water moves?
His grace and his strength just took our breath away. For 20 minutes, he animated one piece of driftwood after the other. Suddenly, he was not disabled. We were not gathered in this kitchen for a care crisis.
Jim was a master puppeteer, an artist, a dancer.
Fran later told me that that moment had been a turning point for her, that she learned how to connect with him even as he progressed through the dementia.
And it really became a turning point for me, too. I learned that this creative, open-ended approach could help families shift, expand their understanding of dementia as more than just tragic emptiness and loss into also meaningful connection and hope and love. Because, creative expression in any form is generative.
It helps make beauty and meaning and value where there might have been absolutely nothing before.
If we can infuse that creativity into care, caregivers can invite a partner into meaning-making, and in that moment, care, which is so often associated with loss, can become generative.
But so many settings of care offer bingo and balloon toss. Activities are passive and entertainment-oriented.
Bringing this creative care to scale could truly shift the field. But could we do it?
Could we infuse it into a whole care organization or an entire care system?
She was a very powerful woman who had lost a battle with a stroke that stole her ability to speak.
Alice had just three forms of communication left.

Everyone has a story.
The challenge for the listener is how to invite it into being, and how to really hear it.
Now, Alzheimer's and dementia, these are two words that, when you say them in front of people, you can watch a cloud descend over them.
You can imagine me at dinner parties.
"What do you do? " "Well, I invite people with Alzheimer's and dementia into expression. Where are you going?
Science is pushing for treatments, dreaming of cures, but loosening that grip of stigma and fear could ease the pain of so many people right now. And luckily, meaningful connection doesn't take a pill.
It takes reaching out. It takes listening.
And it takes a dose of wonder.That really has become my unending quest, set in motion by Alice and then later on by really countless elders in nursing homes and day centers and those struggling to stay at home.
And it comes down to the question of how. How do you meaningfully connect?
We say things like, "Do you remember that time?
" But nine times out of 10, the pathway for that one answer to travel in the brain is broken, and we're left alone with a loved one in the fog. But there is another way in.
I call them beautiful questions. A beautiful question is one that opens a shared path of discovery.
With no right or wrong answer, a beautiful question helps us shift away from the expectation of memory into the freedom of imagination, a thousand possible responses for people with cognitive challenges.
Now, back in the kitchen, I did know one thing about Jim. I knew that he liked to walk along Lake Michigan, and when I looked around that kitchen, I saw, over by the stove, this trunk that was just covered in little pieces of driftwood.
And I thought, "I'll try a question that he could answer without words. " So I tried, "Jim, can you show me how water moves?
His grace and his strength just took our breath away. For 20 minutes, he animated one piece of driftwood after the other. Suddenly, he was not disabled. We were not gathered in this kitchen for a care crisis.
Jim was a master puppeteer, an artist, a dancer.
Fran later told me that that moment had been a turning point for her, that she learned how to connect with him even as he progressed through the dementia.
And it really became a turning point for me, too. I learned that this creative, open-ended approach could help families shift, expand their understanding of dementia as more than just tragic emptiness and loss into also meaningful connection and hope and love. Because, creative expression in any form is generative.
It helps make beauty and meaning and value where there might have been absolutely nothing before.
If we can infuse that creativity into care, caregivers can invite a partner into meaning-making, and in that moment, care, which is so often associated with loss, can become generative.
But so many settings of care offer bingo and balloon toss. Activities are passive and entertainment-oriented.
Bringing this creative care to scale could truly shift the field. But could we do it?
Could we infuse it into a whole care organization or an entire care system?
And that care can put us in touch with the deepest parts of our humanity, our yearning to connect and make meaning together all the way to the end. Thank you. (Applause)
A new virus emerges and spreads like wildfire.
In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data about who’s been infected.
Two main viral testing techniques are critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows if you’ve already had it.
So, how exactly do these tests work?
PCR, or polymerase chain reaction testing, targets the virus’s genetic material in the body and is used to diagnose someone who is currently infected.
Yet, this genetic material may be present in such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult.
This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed.
To develop a PCR test for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence its genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique to that specific virus.
PCR then targets these particular segments.
A PCR test begins by collecting a sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, feces for poliovirus, and samples from the nose or throat for coronaviruses.
The sample is taken to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test for the presence of the virus’ genome.
Genetic information can be encoded via DNA or RNA.
HPV, for example, uses DNA, while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA.
Before running the PCR, the viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed to make a strand of complementary DNA.
Researchers then run the PCR.
If the virus is present in the sample, its unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary primers and copied by enzymes.
One strand of DNA becomes hundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked with fluorescent dye.
If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive for the virus, meaning the individual is infected.
Immunoassays, on the other hand, tap into the immune system’s memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously been infected.
They work by targeting virus-specific antibodies generated by the immune system during infection.
These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign substances, like viruses.
Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, the most abundant class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first produced in response to a new infection.
The presence of IgM antibodies suggests a recent infection, but since it can take the body over a week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing current infections.
Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate for an extended period after infection; their presence usually indicates that someone was exposed and recovered.
Before the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood from an individual.
This sample then comes into contact with a portion of the virus of interest.
If the body has, in fact, been exposed to the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies will bind to it during the test.
This reaction produces a change in color, indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been exposed to the virus.
Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively diagnosing people who were infected but went untested.
And there’s exciting potential for those who have developed immunity to a virus: in some cases, their blood plasma could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it.
PCR and immunoassays are always in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient.
For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use of self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour.
Digital PCR, which quantifies individual pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further boosting accuracy.
And although immunoassays are difficult to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able to create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.
These tests— along with the scientists who develop them and the health professionals who administer them— are absolutely essential.
And when deployed early, they can save millions of lives.
For almost a decade, scientists chased the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains and most isolated caverns.
They finally found it here: in the bats of Shitou Cave.
The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin.
There are hundreds of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, and can cause disease.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections of the nose and throat.
Two infect the lungs, and cause much more severe illnesses.
The seventh, which causes COVID-19, has features of each: it spreads easily, but can severely impact the lungs.
When an infected person coughs, droplets containing the virus spray out.
The virus can infect a new person when the droplets enter their nose or mouth.
Coronaviruses transmit best in enclosed spaces, where people are close together.
Cold weather keeps their delicate casing from drying out, enabling the virus to survive for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight may damage it.
These seasonal variations matter more for established viruses.
But because no one is yet immune to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread.
In the body, the protein spikes embed in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes.
Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA.
All viruses are either RNA viruses or DNA viruses.
RNA viruses tend to be smaller, with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts and replicate quickly in those hosts.
In general, RNA viruses don’t have a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do.
So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have mistakes called mutations.
Many of these mutations are useless or even harmful.
But some make the virus better suited for certain environments— like a new host species.
Epidemics often occur when a virus jumps from animals to humans.
This is true of the RNA viruses that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, or strains, of the original one.
Coronaviruses have a few key differences from most RNA viruses.
They’re some of the largest, meaning they have the most genes.
That creates more opportunity for harmful mutations.
To counteract this risk, coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication errors and corrects mistakes.
This makes coronaviruses much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, than other RNA viruses.
While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them.
After an infection, our immune systems can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick.
But mutations can make a virus less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off.
They can also make antiviral drugs and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored very specifically to a virus.
That’s why we need a new flu vaccine every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly that new strains pop up constantly.
The slower mutation rate of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, and vaccines might be able to recognize them for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better.
Still, we don’t know how long our bodies remain immune to different coronaviruses.
There’s never been an approved treatment or vaccine for a coronavirus.
We haven’t focused on treating the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those treatments completed clinical trials.
As we continue to encroach on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, it doesn’t have to be devastating.
They were dirty and muddy and crying.
Their faces were full of tears.
I had the opportunity to go in and be with them.
And they were all around me.
They were little ones, some of them not older than five years old.
And they were saying to me, (Spanish) "Sácame de aquí. " "Get me out of here.
" (Spanish) "Por favor, ayúdame. " "Please, help me.
" It was so difficult to be there with them. I started to cry with them, and I told them, "Let us pray.
" (Spanish) "Vamos a rezar. " And they repeated after me, (Spanish) "Diosito, ayúdanos. " "God, please, help us.
" As we prayed, I could see the Border Patrol officers looking through a glass window.
They were at the verge of tears.
As they heard the children praying and witness.
I had a little boy get close to me, closer, because they were all over, we could barely fit in that little cell.
And this little boy tells me, (Spanish) "Ayúdame.
Quiero irme con mi mamá.
" "Please, help me.
I want to be with my mother.
She is here, I was separated from her.
" I said to him, "Mijo, if your mom is here, I'm certain you will be reunited.
" When I walked out of the cell, an officer got close to me and said to me, "Sister, thank you.
You have helped us realize that they are human beings.
" You know, sometimes, no matter what job we have, we must never forget to recognize the humanity in others.
Otherwise, we will lose our own humanity.
Let me tell you a bit about what I see and what I do in the southern border of the United States where I live and where I work.
Hundreds of families enter the United States by crossing the Rio Grande river.
And once they are in the United States, many of them are given permission to continue their process of immigration at another point in the United States.
What has amazed me for all these years has been the amazing humanitarian response of the community there in south Texas.
Thousands of volunteers have given of their time so generously.
For me, they're all amazing people.
And the whole community, city government, from local business leaders to civic organizations, all faith communities, in the Border Patrol and ICE.
We have all come together in an effort to help 150,000 or more immigrants since that first day that we got started.
Back in those first days when we were first involved in helping the immigrants, we were at our respite center, and an officer from the city walks in and tells me, "Sister, what are you doing here?
" I turned and looked to see what was happening at the respite center.
I was amazed at what I was seeing.
There were hundreds of volunteers helping so many families there that needed help.
Giving them ways to get cleaned up and to get clean clothing, food, hygiene items. Just love and compassion was seen everywhere.
So I turned back and I responded to him and I said, "Restoring human dignity.
That's what we're doing.
" I don't think he expected that answer from me, because he took a step back and then approached me again and said, "Sister, if I had a magic wand, what would that magic wand do for you?
" "Showers?
" Sure enough, that evening we had a mobile unit of eight showers. Amazing. And after that, we had 100 percent support of the city government.
We were there, wanting to make sure that we were helping and be successful with our response to so many families that we were seeing every single day.
I think that we must help others see what we see.
I think it's important that we can share that with others.
To really meet up with them.
It is then that we are present to them and we can make their humanity a part of our own humanity.
And we'd recognize that we are all part of the same human family.
During those days, I had a lady approach me and tell me, "Sister, I am 100 percent against what you do, helping these illegal aliens.
" And I said to her, "Let me tell you what I do and why.
" So I shared with her and introduced her to the families and the children, shared the stories that they are living.
When I finished talking with her, she turns and looks at me and says, "Sister, I am 100 percent in favor of what you do.
" (Laughter and applause) That evening, her husband calls me, he tells me, "Sister, I don't know what you did to my wife.
" Well, you know . . . I'm thinking that -- was it a personal encounter that she had?
I think it's a nice idea, a nice message, but I don't think it's the whole story.
In that encounter, we must put aside our prejudice that we have toward others, that separate us and don't allow us to see them, our walls that we put up in our own heart that keep us separated from others.
When we are able to do that, we're able to reach out to them.
You know, I think what doesn't make it possible is fear -- that we're afraid.
Immigrant families are not criminals.
Immigrant families are like our families, like our neighbors.
They're good people who are entering our country and coming to the United States only simply because they're fleeing away from violence and they want to be safe.
Unfortunately, what we see at the border is terrible.
People are hurting and suffering.
Thousands of them are.
And mostly I feel it's because of those walls that we put up, that we have in our hearts, that makes us not care.
So we have policies that are returning people back to Mexico, so they can wait.
And they wait there for months.
In conditions that are horrible, where people are suffering and hurting. Abuses. And not even the means to be OK.
I think that it is true that we must keep our country safe, that we must make sure who enters our country, that criminals should be put away.
But it is also true that we must not lose our humanity in doing this.
That we must have policies and procedures that do not contribute to the human suffering that people are already suffering.
And that we can find solutions that are respectful to all human life.
We can do this, if we can allow the best in us to come out.
Because what I see at the border are families, men, who will take a child and will try to comfort that child that is crying because that child is crying for their own dad.
And these men are crying with that child.
I see men and women who drop to their knees, praying.
As they pray in thanksgiving.
I see children who have been separated from their parents for months.
And when they're reunited, they're afraid to separate themselves from them, because they're afraid they will lose their mom again.
Once a child looked up to me after she was reunited and she said to me, (Spanish) "Hoy no voy a llorar. " "Today I'm not going to cry.
" And I said, (Spanish) "Por qué, mi hija?
" She said, "Because I have been crying for the past whole month, because I didn't know where my mother was.
But tonight, I'm going to be with her.
" The day I visited the detention facility back in 2014, there was a little boy who approached me and asked me for me to help him find his mom.
Well, that evening, when I was at the humanitarian respite center, the little boy walked in with his mother.
And as soon as he spotted me, he runs toward me, I go down to greet him, and he just throws himself to hug me.
It was so beautiful, that was truly a beautiful human encounter.
I think it's humanity at its best.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When you're know you're dying to ask. (Laughter) Even on those days when you would swear you were being punked, we're not afraid of it. Because we know that whatever comes in through those ER double doors, that we can handle it. That we're ready.
Work by Dr. Robert Sapolsky shows that individuals who cannot differentiate threat from non-threat and react to everything with the same response have double the level of stress hormones.
Which is why this is the first skill to learn. You can't take care of them all at once, but you don't have to. Because we triage.
Red -- immediately life-threatening. Yellow -- serious, but not immediately life-threatening.
Green -- minor.
And we focus our efforts first on the reds. Now hear this. Part of the problem in Crazy Mode is that you are reacting to everything as if it is red. So start by triaging correctly.
Know your reds. They're what is most important and where you can most move the needle. Now it's easy to be confused by noise, but what it noisiest is not always what is most red.
In fact, my severe asthmatic patient is most at risk when he's quiet. But my patient over here, demanding that I bring her flavored coffee creamer, she's noisy, but she's not red. I'll give you an example from my own life.
Remember, relentlessly triage.The house flood repair?
Well, once we had stopped and stabilized the damage, it was no longer a red. It felt red, but it was in fact just noise.
No, no really, it was quite noisy, this picture on the far right is me wearing earplugs to focus on my book, while the floor is being mechanically dried around me.
And that is black.
Those patients for whom there is nothing we can do. Where we must move on.
And although it is gut-wrenching, I mention it, because you each have your own equivalent black tasks in your life. These are items that you must take off your list. And I think many of you know what I'm talking about.
For me, this was the fundraiser. I had to step down.
Colocate. When it comes to exercise, store all the equipment that you need for a certain activity together, charged and ready, so you don't spend energy looking for it. And decrease temptations, for anyone driven by sugar cravings. Anyone?
Say aye, go ahead. That itself is its own form of Crazy Mode and self-medication for Crazy Mode, but stop working your willpower.
Design differently.
Which bring us to the third step to go from Crazy Mode to Ready Mode, and that is to get out of your head.Come with me.Different story.
I'm working in a small, satellite ER, when a woman comes in in labor.
I realize that the cord is wrapped not once but twice around the baby's neck. And I'm the only doctor. I was scared. But I couldn't let it derail me.
Because, you see, we all get nervous.We all get scared, but it's what you do next that matters.That first feeling isn't the problem.It can be an important sign.
The problem comes when we let it derail us. When that internal monologue starts and we catastrophize and we start to get that tunnel vision. That's how you think when you're in Crazy Mode, and you cannot solve anything that way.
Now I promise to come back to the story, but first, how do I get out of my own head?
There are many tactics that you may hear, but for me, I find it best in the moment to actively put my focus on someone else.
To deliberately make myself see the person in front of me, see myself in the arena with them -- what do they need, what do they fear and how can I help?
This may sound like a whole lot of warm and fuzzy to you, but it's not.
" (Laughter) And for a moment, the strong cries of a newborn drowned out the beeps and the sirens that are the normal sounds of the ER. But there was also something else.
Others notice. They want it too, they just don't know how, they just need one example.
Which could be you. Own the busy. But stop calling it crazy. You've always had that ability.
But now . . . you're ready.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This made growing up pretty hard.I was worried about a lot of things that other kids weren't, and school got really overwhelming sometimes.This resulted in a lot of breakdowns, panic attacks -- sometimes I was super productive, and other days I couldn't get anything done.
[In January 2020, Christian Happi and Pardis Sabeti presented an Audacious idea] [Sentinel: An early warning system to detect and track the next pandemic] [Here's how it would work . . . ] Christian Happi: Sentinel is a proactive early warning system to preempt pandemics.
It is built on three major pillars.
Pardis Sabeti: The first pillar is Detect.
Christian and I have been studying infectious diseases together around the world for two decades.
We have been using genome sequencing.
Reading out the complete genetic information of a microbe, it allows us to identify viruses, even those we've never seen before, track them as they spread and watch for new mutations.
And now with the powerful gene-editing technology CRISPR, we can use this genetic information to rapidly design exquisitely sensitive diagnostic tests for any microbe. CH: One of these tools is called SHERLOCK. It can be used to test known viruses on simple paper strips.
CH: Our third pillar is Empower.
An outbreak surveillance system can only succeed if we empower frontline health workers that are already out there taking care of communities.
It requires a lot of training.
Pardis and I are very much aware of that.
We've spent the past 10 years training hundreds of young African scientists and clinicians. Over the next five years, we will train an additional 1,000 health workers to use Sentinel detection tools and empower them to train their colleagues.
This way, we will improve the original health care system and integrate surveillance into medical practice. [Since presenting their Audacious plan at TED, the world has changed . . . ] Briar Goldberg: So here we are.
We're recording this.
It's April 7th, 2020, and obviously, we are in the throes of this crazy global pandemic caused by this new coronavirus.
So you two have been working together forever, and you really came together pretty aggressively with the Ebola crisis back in 2014. What does it feel like from your perspective?
CH: Pretty much six years after the Ebola outbreak, we're really facing another crisis, and we still pretty much, like, we never learned from the previous crisis.
And that, really, for me, is heartbreaking.
PS: I think that this pandemic has shown us how unprepared we are everywhere in the world.
Christian and our partners together had diagnostics at our hospital sites in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Senegal in early February. Most states in the United States didn't have it until far later.
It tells us that we are all in this together, and we are all very much behind the curve.
BG: So, this Sentinel system is amazing, but I know that the question that's on everybody's mind is: How is that playing into the here and now?
And so all of the technologies that we have laid out -- the point-of-care testing, the multiplex testing, the discovery and tracking of the virus as it's changing, and the overlay of the mobile applications to dashboard -- are all critical.
CH: For us, it is a war.
We are basically committed for 24 hours' turnaround time in order to give results, and that requires for us to work around the clock nonstop. So it's a pretty challenging moment.
We are away from family.
At least I have the privilege to see family today, and then I'm sure tomorrow I'm heading back in the trenches. In my lab, we sequenced the first COVID-19 genome on the African continent, and that really was done within 48 hours.
This is revolutionary coming from Africa and then making this information available for the global health community to see what the virus within Africa looks like.
I believe that with technologies and knowledge and then sharing information, we can do better and then we can overcome.
PS: The whole idea of Sentinel is that we all stand guard over each other. We all watch. Each one of us is a sentinel.
Each one of us, being able to monitor what is making us sick, can share that with the rest of our community.
And I think that is what I profoundly want, is for us to all stand guard and watch over each other. [Dr. Pardis Sabeti and Dr.Christian Happi] [Ingenious scientists. Courageous partners.
Global heroes.
Helen Walters: Huang, it's so good to see you.
Thank you for joining us. How's your 2020 been?
Huang Hung: My 2020 started totally normal.
In January, I went to Paris, did my interview for the fashion week there, came back to Beijing on January 22nd, and finding things a little bit tense because there were a lot of rumors.
Having lived through SARS, I wasn't that concerned.
And on the 23rd, I had a friend of mine from New York come to my house who had a flu, and we had dinner together, and another friend who came, who left the next day for Australia for vacation on an airplane.
So we were not taking this terribly seriously until there was a lockdown.
HW: And we've seen that echo around the world.
I think still some people find it hard to understand the magnitude of some of the measures that China took.
I mean -- what else are we missing about China's response in all of this?
HH: You know, historically, we're just two very different countries in terms of culture and history.
I mean, these are two completely different human experiences for its people.
So, for China, when the lockdown happens, people are OK.
People are OK with it, because they think that's what a good parent should do.
You know, if a kid gets sick, you put him in the other room, and you lock him up and make sure that the other kids don't get sick.
And they expect that out of the government.
But when it is outside of China, from America, it becomes a huge issue of the right political thing to do and whether it's infringing on personal freedom.
So the issues that you have to deal with in a democratic society are issues that one does not have to deal with in China.
I have to say that there's a word in Chinese that doesn't exist in any other language, and the word is called "guāi.
" It is what you call a kid who listens to his or her parents.
So I think, as a people, we are very "guāi.
" We have this sort of authoritarian figure that Chinese always look up to, and they do expect the government to actually take the actions, and they will deal with it.
However much suffering there is, they feel that, OK, if big brother says that this has to be done, then it must be done.
And that really defines China as a separate mentality, Chinese has a separate mentality, as, say, people in Europe and America.
HW: That sense of collective responsibility sometimes feels a little absent from this culture.
At the same time, there are, I think, valid concerns around surveillance and data privacy, things like that.
What is the balance here, and what is the right trade-off between surveillance and freedom?
HH: I think in the internet age, it is somewhere between China and the US.
I think when you take individual freedom versus collective safety, there has to be a balance somewhere there.
With surveillance, the head of Baidu, Robin Li, once said the Chinese people are quite willing to give up certain individual rights in exchange for convenience.
Actually, he was completely criticized on Chinese social media, but I think he is right.
So I think the West really needs to move a step towards the East and to think about the collective as a whole rather than only think about oneself as an individual.
Do you see a change in the media?
" completely changed 180 degrees.
So under authoritarian government, they still are very aware of public opinion, but, on the other hand, when people complain and when they commemorate Dr.
And one of the reasons is because they have never, ever known another system.
This is the system they know how to work.
HH: Oh, of course.
HH: Yes.
So it is a time to be together, rather than to try to pull the world apart and crawl back to our own nationalistic shells.
HW: It's a beautiful sentiment.
Huang Hung, thank you so much for joining us from Beijing.
Stay well, please.
HH: Thank you, Helen, and you stay well as well.
Your hands, up close, are anything but smooth.
With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places for a virus to stick.
If you then touch your face, the virus can infect you.
But there are two extraordinarily simple ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer.
So which is better?
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer.
These lipids are pin shaped molecules whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it.
So in water-rich environments, lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside and the tails inside.
Their shared reaction to water makes the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect.
This outer structure helps the molecular machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes and hijack our cells.
But it has thousands upon thousands of weak points where the right molecules could pry it apart.
And this is where soap comes in.
A single drop of any brand of soap contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, which resemble biological lipids.
Their tails, which are similarly repulsed by water, compete for space with the lipids that make up the virus’s shell.
But they’re just different enough to break up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down.
Those amphiphiles then form bubbles of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins.
Apply water, and you’ll wash that whole bubble away.
Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, and more like an earthquake.
When you surround a coronavirus with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds within the membrane their strength.
That same effect also holds the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables them to infect your cells.
If you dry the virus out in air, it keeps its stability.
But now surround it with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found in most hand-sanitizers.
This makes the hydrophobic effect disappear, and gives the molecules room to move around.
The overall effect is like removing all of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake.
The cell’s membrane collapses and those spike proteins crumble.
In either method, the actual process of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two.
But doctors recommend at least 20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape that is your hand.
Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere, including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, and between your fingers, to protect you properly.
And when it comes to a coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands with soap and water whenever possible.
Even though both approaches are similarly effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which could otherwise hide virus particles.
But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds.
Of course, hand sanitizer is more convenient to use on the go.
In the absence of a sink, use the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together until they’re dry.
Unfortunately, there are billions of people who don’t have access to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time but especially during an outbreak.
Researchers and aid groups are working to provide solutions for these communities.
One example is a device that uses salt, water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing.
So wherever possible, soap and water are recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best for every viral outbreak?
Not necessarily.
Many common colds are caused by rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure called a capsid instead of a lipid membrane.
The capsid doesn't have nearly as many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer for soap to be effective.
However some of its surface proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect of hand sanitizer.
In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer may be more effective, especially if you then wash your hands to remove residual particles.
The best way to know which to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best for all things illness-related: follow the advice of accredited medical professionals.Your hands, up close, are anything but smooth.
With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places for a virus to stick.
If you then touch your face, the virus can infect you.
But there are two extraordinarily simple ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer.
So which is better?
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer.
These lipids are pin shaped molecules whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it.
So in water-rich environments, lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside and the tails inside.
Their shared reaction to water makes the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect.
This outer structure helps the molecular machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes and hijack our cells.
But it has thousands upon thousands of weak points where the right molecules could pry it apart.
And this is where soap comes in.
A single drop of any brand of soap contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, which resemble biological lipids.
Their tails, which are similarly repulsed by water, compete for space with the lipids that make up the virus’s shell.
But they’re just different enough to break up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down.
Those amphiphiles then form bubbles of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins.
Apply water, and you’ll wash that whole bubble away.
Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, and more like an earthquake.
When you surround a coronavirus with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds within the membrane their strength.
That same effect also holds the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables them to infect your cells.
If you dry the virus out in air, it keeps its stability.
But now surround it with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found in most hand-sanitizers.
This makes the hydrophobic effect disappear, and gives the molecules room to move around.
The overall effect is like removing all of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake.
The cell’s membrane collapses and those spike proteins crumble.
In either method, the actual process of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two.
But doctors recommend at least 20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape that is your hand.
Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere, including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, and between your fingers, to protect you properly.
And when it comes to a coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands with soap and water whenever possible.
Even though both approaches are similarly effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which could otherwise hide virus particles.
But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds.
Of course, hand sanitizer is more convenient to use on the go.
In the absence of a sink, use the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together until they’re dry.
Unfortunately, there are billions of people who don’t have access to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time but especially during an outbreak.
Researchers and aid groups are working to provide solutions for these communities.
One example is a device that uses salt, water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing.

The best way to know which to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best for all things illness-related: follow the advice of accredited medical professionals.
So please welcome here Dr.Larry Brilliant. Larry, so good to see you. Larry Brilliant: Thank you, nice to see you. CA: Larry, in that talk, you showed a video clip that was a simulation of what a pandemic might look like.
I would like to play it -- this gave me chills.Larry Brilliant (TED2006): Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like, so we know what we're talking about.
Let's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia.
It initially goes quite slowly, you get two or three discrete locations.
Then there will be secondary outbreaks.
And the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you.
Within three weeks, it will be everywhere in the world.
CA: Larry, that phrase you mentioned there, "early detection," "early response," that was a key theme of that talk, you made us all repeat it several times.
Is that still the key to preventing a pandemic?
LB: Oh, surely.
You know, when you have a pandemic, something moving at exponential speed, if you miss the first two weeks, if you're late the first two weeks, it's not the deaths and the illness from the first two weeks you lose, it's the two weeks at the peak.
Those are prevented if you act early.
Early response is critical, early detection is a condition precedent.
CA: And how would you grade the world on its early detection, early response to COVID-19? LB: Of course, you gave me this question earlier, so I've been thinking a lot about it.
I think I would go through the countries, and I've actually made a list.
I think the island republics of Taiwan, Iceland and certainly New Zealand would get an A.
The island republic of the UK and the United States -- which is not an island, no matter how much we may think we are -- would get a failing grade.
I'd give a B to South Korea and to Germany. And in between . . . So it's a very heterogeneous response, I think. The world as a whole is faltering.
We shouldn't be proud of what's happening right now. CA: I mean, we got the detection pretty early, or at least some doctors in China got the detection pretty early.
LB: Earlier than the 2002 SARS, which took six months.
This took about six weeks.
And detection means not only finding it, but knowing what it is.
So I would give us a pretty good score on that.
The transparency, the communication -- those are other issues.
CA: So what was the key mistake that you think the countries you gave an F to made? LB: I think fear, political incompetence, interference, not taking it seriously soon enough -- it's pretty human.
I think throughout history, pretty much every pandemic is first viewed with denial and doubt.
But those countries that acted quickly, and even those who started slow, like South Korea, they could still make up for it, and they did really well.
We've had two months that we've lost.
We've given a virus that moves exponentially a two-month head start.
That's not a good idea, Chris.
CA: No, indeed.
I mean, there's so much puzzling information still out there about this virus.
What do you think the scientific consensus is going to likely end up being on, like, the two key numbers of its infectiousness and its fatality rate?
LB: So I think the kind of equation to keep in mind is that the virus moves dependent on three major issues. One is the R0, the first number of secondary cases that there are when the virus emerges.
The longer that is, the slower the pandemic appears to us.
When it's really short, like six days, it moves like lightning.
CA: I mean, none of the numbers that you've mentioned so far are in themselves different from any other infections in recent years.
What is the combination that has made this so deadly?
LB: Well, it is exactly the combination of the short incubation period and the high transmissibility.
It's a respiratory disease -- perhaps misleading.
Makes you think of a flu.
But so many of the patients have blood in their urine from kidney disease, they have gastroenteritis, they certainly have heart failure very often, we know that it affects taste and smell, the olfactory nerves, we know, of course, about the lung.
The question I have: is there any organ that it does not affect?
And in that sense, it reminds me all too much of smallpox.
We need to slow down the speed of this virus, which is why we do social distancing.
I mean, Taiwan did it so beautifully, Iceland did it so beautifully, Germany, all with different strategies, South Korea.
But we had a vaccine.
And you were an advisor for.
LB: I do.
I'm actually excited to see that we're doing something that we only get to think of in computer science, which is we're changing what should have always been, or has always been, rather, multiple sequential processes.
Do safety testing, then you test for effectiveness, then for efficiency.
We're doing all three or four of those steps, instead of doing it in sequence, we're doing in parallel.
CA: And how does that translate into a likely time line, do you think?
But you may have heard that this virus may not give us the long-term immunity -- that something like smallpox would do.
Back in 2006, as a winner of the TED Prize, we granted you a wish, and you wished the world would create this pandemic preparedness system that would prevent something like this happening. I feel like we, the world, let you down.
When we met in 2006, the average one of these viruses leaping from an animal to a human, it took us six months to find that -- like the first Ebola, for example.
I think the island republics of Taiwan, Iceland and certainly New Zealand would get an A.
We've had two months that we've lost.
The longer that is, the slower the pandemic appears to us.
When it's really short, like six days, it moves like lightning.
And then the last, and the most important -- and it's often overlooked -- is the density of susceptibles.
CA: I mean, none of the numbers that you've mentioned so far are in themselves different from any other infections in recent years.
What is the combination that has made this so deadly?
LB: Well, it is exactly the combination of the short incubation period and the high transmissibility.
But you know, everybody on this call has known somebody who has the disease.
Sadly, many have lost a loved one.
This is a terrible disease when it is serious.
And I get calls from doctors in emergency rooms and treating people in ICUs all over the world, and they all say the same thing: "How do I choose who is going to live and who is going to die?
I have so few tools to deal with.
" It's a terrifying disease, to die alone with a ventilator in your lungs, and it's a disease that affects all of our organs.
It's a respiratory disease -- perhaps misleading.
Makes you think of a flu.
But so many of the patients have blood in their urine from kidney disease, they have gastroenteritis, they certainly have heart failure very often, we know that it affects taste and smell, the olfactory nerves, we know, of course, about the lung.
The question I have: is there any organ that it does not affect?
And in that sense, it reminds me all too much of smallpox.
CA: So we're in a mess.
What's the way forward from here?
LB: Well, the way forward is still the same.
Rapid detection, rapid response.
Finding every case, and then figuring out all the contacts.
We've got great new technology for contact tracing, we've got amazing scientists working at the speed of light to give us test kits and antivirals and vaccines.
We need to slow down, the Buddhists say slow down time so that you can put your heart, your soul, into that space.
We need to slow down the speed of this virus, which is why we do social distancing.
Can we do this, how can we do this?
LB: Oh, of course we can do this.
I mean, Taiwan did it so beautifully, Iceland did it so beautifully, Germany, all with different strategies, South Korea.
It really requires competent governance, a sense of seriousness, and listening to the scientists, not the politicians following the virus.
Of course we can do this.
Let me remind everybody -- this is not the zombie apocalypse, it's not a mass extinction event.
You know, 98, 99 percent of us are going to get out of this alive.
We need to deal with it the way we know we can, and we need to be the best version of ourselves.
Both sitting at home as well as in science, and certainly in leadership.
CA: And might there be even worse pathogens out there in the future?
Like, can you picture or describe an even worse combination of those numbers that we should start to get ready for?
LB: Well, smallpox had an R0 of 3.5 to 4.5, so that's probably about what I think this COVID will be. But it killed a third of the people.
But we had a vaccine.
So those are the different sets that you have.
But what I'm mostly worried about, and the reason that we made "Contagion" and that was a fictional virus -- I repeat, for those of you watching, that's fiction.
We created a virus that killed a lot more than this one did.
CA: You're talking about the movie "Contagion" that's been trending on Netflix.
And you were an advisor for.
LB: Absolutely, that's right.
But we made that movie deliberately to show what a real pandemic looked like, but we did choose a pretty awful virus.
And the reason we showed it like that, going from a bat to an apple, to a pig, to a cook, to Gwyneth Paltrow, was because that is in nature what we call spillover, as zoonotic diseases, diseases of animals, spill over to human beings.
And if I look backwards three decades or forward three decades -- looking backward three decades, Ebola, SARS, Zika, swine flu, bird flu, West Nile, we can begin almost a catechism and listen to all the cacophony of these names.
But there were 30 to 50 novel viruses that jumped into human beings.
To the virus, we're not.
CA: Mmm.
You mentioned vaccines, though.
Do you see any accelerated path to a vaccine?
LB: I do.
I'm actually excited to see that we're doing something that we only get to think of in computer science, which is we're changing what should have always been, or has always been, rather, multiple sequential processes.
Do safety testing, then you test for effectiveness, then for efficiency.
And then you manufacture.
We're doing all three or four of those steps, instead of doing it in sequence, we're doing in parallel.
Bill Gates has said he's going to build seven vaccine production lines in the United States, and start preparing for production, not knowing what the end vaccine is going to be.
We're simultaneously doing safety tests and efficacy tests.
I think the NIH has jumped up.
I'm very thrilled to see that.
CA: And how does that translate into a likely time line, do you think?
A year, 18 months, is that possible?
LB: You know, Tony Fauci is our guru in this, and he said 12 to 18 months.
I think that we will do faster than that in the initial vaccine.
But you may have heard that this virus may not give us the long-term immunity -- that something like smallpox would do.
So we're trying to make vaccines where we add adjuvants that actually make the vaccine create better immunity than the disease, so that we can confer immunity for many years.
That's going to take a little longer.
CA: Last question, Larry.
Back in 2006, as a winner of the TED Prize, we granted you a wish, and you wished the world would create this pandemic preparedness system that would prevent something like this happening. I feel like we, the world, let you down.
If you were to make another wish now, what would it be?
LB: Well, I don't think we're let down in terms of speed of detection.
I'm actually pretty pleased.
When we met in 2006, the average one of these viruses leaping from an animal to a human, it took us six months to find that -- like the first Ebola, for example.
We're now finding the first cases in two weeks.
I'm not unhappy about that, I'd like to push it down to a single incubation period.
It's a bigger issue for me.
What I found is that in the Smallpox Eradication Programme people of all colors, all religions, all races, so many countries, came together.
And it took working as a global community to conquer a global pandemic.
Now, I feel that we have become victims of centrifugal forces.
We're in our nationalistic kind of barricades.
We will not be able to conquer a pandemic unless we believe we're all in it together.
This is not some Age of Aquarius, or Kumbaya statement, this is what a pandemic forces us to realize.
We are all in it together, we need a global solution to a global problem.
Anything less than that is unthinkable.
CA: Larry Brilliant, thank you so very much.
LB: Thank you, Chris.
I never thought that I would be giving my TED Talk somewhere like this.
But, like half of humanity, I've spent the last four weeks under lockdown due to the global pandemic created by COVID-19. I am extremely fortunate that during this time I've been able to come here to these woods near my home in southern England.
And I'd like to begin that story six years ago, when I had first joined the United Nations. Now, I firmly believe that the UN is of unparalleled importance in the world right now to promote collaboration and cooperation.
But what they don't tell you when you join is that this essential work is delivered mainly in the form of extremely boring meetings -- extremely long, boring meetings.
Now, you may feel that you have attended some long, boring meetings in your life, and I'm sure you have.
But these UN meetings are next-level, and everyone who works there approaches them with a level of calm normally only achieved by Zen masters.
But myself, I wasn't ready for that.
I joined expecting drama and tension and breakthrough.
What I wasn't ready for was a process that seemed to move at the speed of a glacier, at the speed that a glacier used to move at.
Now, in the middle of one of these long meetings, I was handed a note. And it was handed to me by my friend and colleague and coauthor, Christiana Figueres.
Christiana was the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and as such, had overall responsibility for the UN reaching what would become the Paris Agreement.
I was running political strategy for her.
So when she handed me this note, I assumed that it would contain detailed political instructions about how we were going to get out of this nightmare quagmire that we seemed to be trapped in. I took the note and looked at it. It said, "Painful.
But let's approach with love!
" Now, I love this note for lots of reasons. I love the way the little tendrils are coming out from the word "painful.
" It was a really good visual depiction of how I felt at that moment.
But I particularly love it because as I looked at it, I realized that it was a political instruction, and that if we were going to be successful, this was how we were going to do it.
So let me explain that. What I'd been feeling in those meetings was actually about control.
I had moved my life from Brooklyn in New York to Bonn in Germany with the extremely reluctant support of my wife.
My children were now in a school where they couldn't speak the language, and I thought the deal for all this disruption to my world was that I would have some degree of control over what was going to happen.
I felt for years that the climate crisis is the defining challenge of our generation, and here I was, ready to play my part and do something for humanity.
But I put my hands on the levers of control that I'd been given and pulled them, and nothing happened. I realized the things I could control were menial day-to-day things.
"Do I ride my bike to work?
" and "Where do I have lunch?
", whereas the things that were going to determine whether we were going to be successful were issues like, "Will Russia wreck the negotiations?
" "Will China take responsibility for their emissions?
" "Will the US help poorer countries deal with their burden of climate change?
" The differential felt so huge, I could see no way I could bridge the two.
It felt futile.
But even in that moment, I realized that what I was feeling had a lot of similarities to what I'd felt when I first found out about the climate crisis years before.
I'd spent many of my most formative years as a Buddhist monk in my early 20s, but I left the monastic life, because even then, 20 years ago, I felt that the climate crisis was already a quickly unfolding emergency and I wanted to do my part.
But once I'd left and I rejoined the world, I looked at what I could control.
It was the few tons of my own emissions and that of my immediate family, which political party I voted for every few years, whether I went on a march or two.
And then I looked at the issues that would determine the outcome, and they were big geopolitical negotiations, massive infrastructure spending plans, what everybody else did.
It felt futile.
" Or, it plays down our own role. "There's nothing that you individually can do, so why try?
Is it really true that humans will only take sustained and dedicated action on an issue of paramount importance when they feel they have a high degree of control?
What they are doing is caring for their fellow human beings at their moment of greatest vulnerability.
So let me give you a historical story to explain it.
That is also how the transformation happened on the road to the Paris Agreement.
If we're capable of that, maybe we have not yet tested the limits of what humanity can do when it rises to meet a shared challenge.
But let's approach with love!
" and "Where do I have lunch?
" The differential felt so huge, I could see no way I could bridge the two.
It felt futile.
I began to feel that I'd made a mistake. I began to get depressed.
But even in that moment, I realized that what I was feeling had a lot of similarities to what I'd felt when I first found out about the climate crisis years before.
I'd spent many of my most formative years as a Buddhist monk in my early 20s, but I left the monastic life, because even then, 20 years ago, I felt that the climate crisis was already a quickly unfolding emergency and I wanted to do my part.
But once I'd left and I rejoined the world, I looked at what I could control.
It was the few tons of my own emissions and that of my immediate family, which political party I voted for every few years, whether I went on a march or two.
And then I looked at the issues that would determine the outcome, and they were big geopolitical negotiations, massive infrastructure spending plans, what everybody else did.
The differential again felt so huge that I couldn't see any way that I could bridge it.
I kept trying to take action, but it didn't really stick.
It felt futile.
Now, we know that this can be a common experience for many people, and maybe you have had this experience.
" Or, it plays down our own role. "There's nothing that you individually can do, so why try?
" But there's something odd going on here.
Is it really true that humans will only take sustained and dedicated action on an issue of paramount importance when they feel they have a high degree of control?
Look at these pictures.
These people are caregivers and nurses who have been helping humanity face the coronavirus COVID-19 as it has swept around the world as a pandemic in the last few months.
Are these people able to prevent the spread of the disease? No. Are they able to prevent their patients from dying? Some, they will have been able to prevent, but others, it will have been beyond their control.
Does that make their contribution futile and meaningless?
Actually, it's offensive even to suggest that.
What they are doing is caring for their fellow human beings at their moment of greatest vulnerability.
Now, that's interesting, because it shows us that humans are capable of taking dedicated and sustained action, even when they can't control the outcome.
But it leaves us with another challenge.
With the climate crisis, we have this huge separation.
It used to be that we were separated by time. The impacts of the climate crisis were supposed to be way off in the future.
But right now, the future has come to meet us.
Continents are on fire.
Cities are going underwater.
Countries are going underwater.
Hundreds of thousands of people are on the move as a result of climate change.
But even if those impacts are no longer separated from us by time, they're still separated from us in a way that makes it difficult to feel that direct connection. They happen somewhere else to somebody else or to us in a different way than we're used to experiencing it.
So even though that story of the nurse demonstrates something to us about human nature, we're going to have find a different way of dealing with the climate crisis in a sustained manner.
There is a way that we can do this, a powerful combination of a deep and supporting attitude that when combined with consistent action can enable whole societies to take dedicated action in a sustained way towards a shared goal.
It's been used to great effect throughout history.
So let me give you a historical story to explain it.
Right now, I am standing in the woods near my home in southern England.
And these particular woods are not far from London.
Eighty years ago, that city was under attack.
In the late 1930s, the people of Britain would do anything to avoid facing the reality that Hitler would stop at nothing to conquer Europe. Fresh with memories from the First World War, they were terrified of Nazi aggression and would do anything to avoid facing that reality.
In the end, the reality broke through.
Churchill is remembered for many things, and not all of them positive, but what he did in those early days of the war was he changed the story the people of Britain told themselves about what they were doing and what was to come.
Where previously there had been trepidation and nervousness and fear, there came a calm resolve, an island alone, a greatest hour, a greatest generation, a country that would fight them on the beaches and in the hills and in the streets, a country that would never surrender.
That change from fear and trepidation to facing the reality, whatever it was and however dark it was, had nothing to do with the likelihood of winning the war.
There was no news from the front that battles were going better or even at that point that a powerful new ally had joined the fight and changed the odds in their favor.
It was simply a choice.
A deep, determined, stubborn form of optimism emerged, not avoiding or denying the darkness that was pressing in but refusing to be cowed by it.
That stubborn optimism is powerful.
It is not dependent on assuming that the outcome is going to be good or having a form of wishful thinking about the future.
However, what it does is it animates action and infuses it with meaning.
They were animated towards a shared purpose and a shared outcome.
We have seen that throughout history.
This coupling of a deep and determined stubborn optimism with action, when the optimism leads to a determined action, then they can become self-sustaining: without the stubborn optimism, the action doesn't sustain itself; without the action, the stubborn optimism is just an attitude.
The two together can transform an entire issue and change the world.
We saw this at multiple other times.
We saw it when Rosa Parks refused to get up from the bus.
We saw it in Gandhi's long salt marches to the beach. We saw it when the suffragettes said that "Courage calls to courage everywhere.
" And we saw it when Kennedy said that within 10 years, he would put a man on the moon.
That is also how the transformation happened on the road to the Paris Agreement.
Those challenging, difficult, pessimistic meetings transformed as more and more people decided that this was our moment to dig in and determine that we would not drop the ball on our watch, and we would deliver the outcome that we knew was possible.
More and more people transformed themselves to that perspective and began to work, and in the end, that worked its way up into a wave of momentum that crashed over us and delivered many of those challenging issues with a better outcome than we could possibly have imagined.
And even now, years later and with a climate denier in the White House, much that was put in motion in those days is still unfolding, and we have everything to play for in the coming months and years on dealing with the climate crisis.
So right now, we are coming through one of the most challenging periods in the lives of most of us.
The global pandemic has been frightening, whether personal tragedy has been involved or not. But it has also shaken our belief that we are powerless in the face of great change.
In the space of a few weeks, we mobilized to the point where half of humanity took drastic action to protect the most vulnerable.
If we're capable of that, maybe we have not yet tested the limits of what humanity can do when it rises to meet a shared challenge.
We now need to move beyond this narrative of powerlessness, because make no mistake -- the climate crisis will be orders of magnitude worse than the pandemic if we do not take the action that we can still take to avert the tragedy that we see coming towards us.
We can no longer afford the luxury of feeling powerless.
The truth is that future generations will look back at this precise moment with awe as we stand at the crossroads between a regenerative future and one where we have thrown it all away.
And the truth is that a lot is going pretty well for us in this transition.
Costs for clean energy are coming down.
Cities are transforming. Land is being regenerated.
People are on the streets calling for change with a verve and tenacity we have not seen for a generation.
Genuine success is possible in this transition, and genuine failure is possible, too, which makes this the most exciting time to be alive.
We can take a decision right now that we will approach this challenge with a stubborn form of gritty, realistic and determined optimism and do everything within our power to ensure that we shape the path as we come out of this pandemic towards a regenerative future.
Right now, all of these things are possible.
So let's go back to that boring meeting room where I'm looking at that note from Christiana. And looking at it took me back to some of the most transformative experiences of my life.
One of the many things I learned as a monk is that a bright mind and a joyful heart is both the path and the goal in life.
This stubborn optimism is a form of applied love.
It is both the world we want to create and the way in which we can create that world.
And it is a choice for all of us. Choosing to face this moment with stubborn optimism can fill our lives with meaning and purpose, and in doing so, we can put a hand on the arc of history and bend it towards the future that we choose.
Yes, living now feels out of control. It feels frightening and scary and new.
But let's not falter at this most crucial of transitions that is coming at us right now.
Let's face it with stubborn and determined optimism.
Yes, seeing the changes in the world right now can be painful. But let's approach it with love.
But I'm still pretty new to it.
They love a good personal story.
But that's not really why I decided to jump into finance.
And the reason this is true has something to do with the narratives that society has kept hitting us with in the news, in the workplace and even by those annoyingly self-critical voices in our heads.
The other narrative that I'm going to talk about is the idea of the superimmigrant.
In America, we love to idolize superimmigrants as the ideal symbols of American success.
And this really affected my self-image, because I started to question these ideas for who my parents were and who I was, and I started to wonder, "Am I doing enough to protect my family and my community from the injustices that we felt every day?
Now I understand that this means different things to different people.
I mean, I was really lucky, and I want you to know that.
You do not have to be an immigrant or the child of immigrants to know that.
But I do know that now, today, I am living something close to what my parents saw as their American dream.
I did not know it back then, but during those eight years that I lived without my family, I had my oxygen mask on and I focused on survival.
But being able to have that self-control is sometimes the only way that we are able to help those around us.
Now I'm super lucky to be in a place where I can be there for my little brother so that he feels confident and prepared to take on whatever he chooses to do next.
But I also know that because I am in this position of privilege, I also have the responsibility to make sure that my community finds spaces where they can find guidance, access and support.
I can't claim to know where each and every one of you are on your journey through life, but I do know that our world is one that flourishes when different voices come together.
My hope is that you will find the courage to put your oxygen mask on when you need to, and that you will find the strength to help those around you when you can.
Thank you.
(Applause)Hi, everyone, my name is Elizabeth, and I work on the trading floor.
But I'm still pretty new to it.
I graduated from college about a year and a half ago, and to be quite honest, I'm still recovering from the recruiting process I had to go through to get here.
(Laughter) Now, I don't know about you, but this is the most ridiculous thing that I still remember about the whole process, was asking insecure college students what their biggest passion was.
Like, do you expect me to have an answer for that?
(Laughter) Of course I did.
They love a good personal story.
But you know what?
I lied.
(Laughter) And not because the things I said weren't true -- I mean, my parents were talking about this stuff.
But that's not really why I decided to jump into finance.
I just really wanted to pay my rent.
(Laughter) And here's the thing.
The reality of having to pay my rent and do real adult things is something that we're rarely willing to admit to employers, to others and even to ourselves.
I know I wasn't about to tell my recruiters that I was there for the money.
And that's because for the most part, we want to see ourselves as idealists and as people who do what they believe in and pursue the things that they find the most exciting.
But the reality is very few of us actually have the privilege to do that. Now, I can't speak for everyone, but this is especially true for young immigrant professionals like me.
And the reason this is true has something to do with the narratives that society has kept hitting us with in the news, in the workplace and even by those annoyingly self-critical voices in our heads.
Well, there's two that come to mind when it comes to immigrants.
The first is the idea of the immigrant worker.
You know, people that come to the US in search of jobs as laborers, or field workers, dish washers.
You know, things that we might consider low-wage jobs but the immigrants?
That's a good opportunity.
And as immigrant expert George Borjas would have put it, it's kind of like America wanted workers, but then, they got confused when we got people instead.
(Laughter) I mean, it's natural that people want to strive to put a roof over their heads and live a normal life, right?
So for obvious reasons, this narrative has been driving me a little bit crazy.
But it's not the only one.
The other narrative that I'm going to talk about is the idea of the superimmigrant.
In America, we love to idolize superimmigrants as the ideal symbols of American success.
I grew up admiring superimmigrants, because their existence fueled my dreams and it gave me hope.
The problem with this narrative is that it also seems to cast a shadow on those that don't succeed or that don't make it in that way, as less than.
And for years, I got caught up in the ways in which it seemed to celebrate one type of immigrant while villainizing the other.
I mean, were my parents' sacrifices not enough?
Was the fact that my dad came home from the metal factory covered in corrosive dust, was that not super?
Don't get me wrong, I've internalized both of these narratives to some degree, and in many ways, seeing my heroes succeed, it has pushed me to do the same.
But both of these narratives are flawed in the ways in which they dehumanize people if they don't fit within a certain mold or succeed in a certain way.
And this really affected my self-image, because I started to question these ideas for who my parents were and who I was, and I started to wonder, "Am I doing enough to protect my family and my community from the injustices that we felt every day?
" So why did I choose to "sell out" while watching tragedies unfold right in front of me?
Now, it took me a long time to come to terms with my decisions.
And I really have to thank the people running the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, or HSF, for validating this process early on.
And the way that HSF -- an organization that strives to help students achieve higher education through mentorship and scholarships -- the way that they helped calm my anxiety, it was by telling me something super familiar.
Something that you all probably have heard before in the first few minutes after boarding a flight.
In case of an emergency, put your oxygen mask on first before helping those around you.
Now I understand that this means different things to different people.
But for me, it meant that immigrants couldn't and would never be able to fit into any one narrative, because most of us are actually just traveling along a spectrum, trying to survive.
And although there may be people that are further along in life with their oxygen mask on and secured in place, there are undoubtedly going to be others that are still struggling to put theirs on before they can even think about helping those around them.
But the ways in which the world sees immigrants, it affects more than just the narratives in which they live.
It also impacts the ways laws and systems can affect communities, families and individuals.
I know this firsthand, because these laws and systems, well, they broke up my family, and they led my parents to return to Mexico.
And at 15, my eight-year-old brother and I, we found ourselves alone and without the guidance that our parents had always provided us with.
Despite being American citizens, we both felt defeated by what we had always known to be the land of opportunity.
Now, in the weeks that followed my parents' return to Mexico, when it became clear that they wouldn't be able to come back, I had to watch as my eight-year-old brother was pulled out of school to be with his family.
And during this same time, I wondered if going back would be validating my parents' sacrifices. And so I somehow convinced my parents to let me stay, without being able to guarantee them that I'd find somewhere to live or that I'd be OK.
But to this day, I will never forget how hard it was having to say goodbye.
And I will never forget how hard it was watching my little brother crumble in their arms as I waved goodbye from the other side of steel grates.
Now, it would be naive to credit grit as the sole reason for why I've been able to take advantage of so many opportunities since that day.
I mean, I was really lucky, and I want you to know that.
Because statistically speaking, students that are homeless or that have unstable living conditions, well, they rarely complete high school.
But I do think that it was because my parents had the trust in letting me go that I somehow found the courage and strength to take on opportunities even when I felt unsure or unqualified.
Now, there's no denying that there is a cost to living the American dream.
You do not have to be an immigrant or the child of immigrants to know that.
But I do know that now, today, I am living something close to what my parents saw as their American dream.
Because as soon as I graduated from college, I flew my younger brother to the United States to live with me, so that he, too, could pursue his education.
Still, I knew that it would be hard flying my little brother back.
I knew that it would be hard having to balance the demands and professionalism required of an entry-level job while being responsible for a child with dreams and ambitions of his own.
But you can imagine how fun it is to be 24 years old, at the peak of my youth, living in New York, with an angsty teenage roommate who hates doing the dishes.
(Laughter) The worst.
(Laughter) But when I see my brother learning how to advocate for himself, and when I see him get excited about his classes and school, I do not doubt anything.
Because I know that this bizarre, beautiful and privileged life that I now live is the true reason for why I decided to pursue a career that would help me and my family find financial stability.
I did not know it back then, but during those eight years that I lived without my family, I had my oxygen mask on and I focused on survival.
And during those same eight years, I had to watch helplessly the pain and hurt that it caused my family to be apart.
What airlines don't tell you is that putting your oxygen mask on first while seeing those around you struggle -- it takes a lot of courage.
But being able to have that self-control is sometimes the only way that we are able to help those around us.
Now I'm super lucky to be in a place where I can be there for my little brother so that he feels confident and prepared to take on whatever he chooses to do next.
But I also know that because I am in this position of privilege, I also have the responsibility to make sure that my community finds spaces where they can find guidance, access and support.
I can't claim to know where each and every one of you are on your journey through life, but I do know that our world is one that flourishes when different voices come together.
My hope is that you will find the courage to put your oxygen mask on when you need to, and that you will find the strength to help those around you when you can.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I am a public policy wonk. I investigate data that points to problems in the American economy -- problems like rising household debt, declining wages and benefits, shortfalls in public revenue.
And I try to pinpoint solutions to make our economy more prosperous for more people. I geek out about tax policy and infrastructure investments, and I get really excited by a gracefully designed regulatory regime.
He said that he had taken my advice.
He said that my words had been like someone wiped the dust from a window and let the light in.
Over the years, Gary and I have become friends.
And Gary would tell you that I've taught him a lot about systemic racism in America and public policy.
But I've learned a lot from Gary, too. And the biggest lesson for me has been that Gary's prejudice has caused him to suffer.
Fear, anxiety, isolation.
And it's made me rethink many of the economic problems I've been focusing on my entire career.
I wondered, is it possible that our society's racism has likewise been backfiring on the very same people set up to benefit from privilege?
Driven by this question, I've spent the past few years traveling the country, researching and writing a book. My conclusion?

I wondered, is it possible that our society's racism has likewise been backfiring on the very same people set up to benefit from privilege?
Driven by this question, I've spent the past few years traveling the country, researching and writing a book. My conclusion?
A friend called me a few weeks ago with bad news.
She dropped her cell phone into the toilet.
Anyone here done that before?
(Laughter) So it was a bad situation.
You know, without getting into the details of exactly how that happened or how she got it out, let's just say it was a bad situation.
And she panicked because, like for many of us, her phone is one of the most used and essential tools in her life.
But, on the other hand, she had no idea how to fix it, because it's a completely mysterious black box.
So think about it: what would you do?
What do you really understand about how your phone works?
What are you willing to test or fix?
For most people, the answer is, nothing.
In fact, one survey found that almost 80 percent of smartphone users in this country have never even replaced their phone batteries, and 25 percent didn't even know this was possible.
Now, I'm an experimental physicist, hence the toys.
I specialize in making new types of nanoscale electronic devices to study their fundamental quantum mechanical properties.
But even I wouldn't know where to start in terms of testing elements on my phone if it broke.
And phones are just one example of the many devices that we depend upon but can't test, take apart, or even fully understand.
Cars, electronics, even toys are now so complicated and advanced that we're scared to open and fix them.
So here's the problem: there's a disconnect between us and the technology that we use.
We're completely alienated from the devices that we most depend upon, which can make us feel helpless and empty.
In fact, it's not surprising then that one study found that we are now more afraid of technology than we are of death.
(Laughter) But I think that we can reconnect to our devices, rehumanize them in a sense, by doing more hands-on experiments.
Why?
Well, because an experiment is a procedure to test a hypothesis, demonstrate a fact.
It's the way that we use our senses, our hands, to connect the world and figure out how it works.
And that's the connection that we're missing.
So let me give you an example.
Now -- let's make sure it's working.
So when I wave my hand near the plates, you can see that the voltage changes just like the touchscreen responds to my hand.
But what is it about my hand?
Now I need to do more experiments.
So I can, say, take a piece of wood and touch one of the plates and see that not much happens, but if I take a piece of metal and touch the plate, then the voltage changes dramatically.
So now I can do further experiments to see what the difference is between the wood and the metal, and I should find out that the wood is not conducting but the metal is conducting like my hand.
And it doesn't really matter whether I'm testing how a touchscreen works or if I'm measuring how conducting different types of materials are, or even if I'm just using my hands to see how hard it is to break different thicknesses of materials.
In all cases, I'm gaining control and understanding of the basis of the things that I use.
So hands-on thinking through experiments connects our understanding, even our sense of vitality, to the physical world and the things that we use.
Now, for me this focus on experiments is also personal.
I remember my sister had a chemistry set that I always wanted to use but she never let me touch.
In fact, when I was nine years old, my grandmother called me a solipsist, which is something I had to look up.
It means that you think that yourself is all that exists.
And at the time I was pretty offended, because whose grandmother calls them that?
So at first, none of them wanted to touch it.
Can you make a hypothesis and test it?
Until, one kid finally sliced it through and found really cool stuff inside.
See, there's a magnet inside, and I can just cut this open.
Cut it open again, you can split it.
And when I drag the pen on it, you can see that these filaments are attached to it.
They all started ripping them open and taking them apart and yelling out the things that they discovered, how these magnetic filaments connected to the magnetic pen and that's how it wrote.
Or, here I have some crushed-up bran cereal.
Right?
That has iron in it.
The same thing in here, cold, and when I make it cold, and put it on top of the magnet, so -- (Applause) It's amazing.
It's called a superconductor.
Now, superconductors can be complex, but even simple experiments can connect us better to the world.
What are you willing to test or fix?
So when I wave my hand near the plates, you can see that the voltage changes just like the touchscreen responds to my hand.
But what is it about my hand?
Now I need to do more experiments.
So I can, say, take a piece of wood and touch one of the plates and see that not much happens, but if I take a piece of metal and touch the plate, then the voltage changes dramatically.
So now I can do further experiments to see what the difference is between the wood and the metal, and I should find out that the wood is not conducting but the metal is conducting like my hand.
And, you see, I build up my understanding.
Like, now I can see why I can't use a touchscreen with gloves, because gloves aren't conducting.
But I've also broken down some of the mystery behind the technology and built up my agency, my personal input and interactions with the basis of my devices.
But experimenting is a step beyond just taking things apart.
It's testing and doing hands-on critical thinking.
And it doesn't really matter whether I'm testing how a touchscreen works or if I'm measuring how conducting different types of materials are, or even if I'm just using my hands to see how hard it is to break different thicknesses of materials.
In all cases, I'm gaining control and understanding of the basis of the things that I use.
And there's research behind this.
For one, I'm using my hands, which seem to promote well-being.
I'm also engaging in hands-on learning, which has been shown to improve understanding and retention, and even activate more parts of your brain.
So hands-on thinking through experiments connects our understanding, even our sense of vitality, to the physical world and the things that we use.
Looking things up on the internet does not have the same effect.
Now, for me this focus on experiments is also personal.
I didn't grow up doing experiments.
I didn't know what a physicist did.
I remember my sister had a chemistry set that I always wanted to use but she never let me touch.
I felt mentally disconnected from the world and didn't know why.
In fact, when I was nine years old, my grandmother called me a solipsist, which is something I had to look up.
It means that you think that yourself is all that exists.
And at the time I was pretty offended, because whose grandmother calls them that?
(Laughter) But I think that it was true.
And then later, when I was able my own testing and understanding through research, a big part of my connection to the world was complete.
Now, I know that not everyone is an experimental physicist by profession, but I think that everyone could be doing more hands-on experiments.
And actually I think we sort of -- I'll give you another example.
I was recently working with some middle school students, helping them learn about magnetism, and I gave them a Magna Doodle to take apart. Remember one of these things?
So at first, none of them wanted to touch it.
They'd been told for so long not to break things that they're accustomed to just passive using.
But then I started asking them questions.
You know, how does it work?
What parts are magnetic?
Can you make a hypothesis and test it?
But they still didn't want to break it open.
They wanted to take it home with them, really.
Until, one kid finally sliced it through and found really cool stuff inside.
And so this is something we can do here together.
They're pretty easy to take apart.
See, there's a magnet inside, and I can just cut this open.
Cut it open again, you can split it.
OK, so when I do that -- I don't know if you can see this, but there is sort of -- there it is, this oozy white stuff in here.
Now you can see it on my finger.
And when I drag the pen on it, you can see that these filaments are attached to it.
So the kids saw this, and at this point they're like, this is really cool.
They got excited.
They all started ripping them open and taking them apart and yelling out the things that they discovered, how these magnetic filaments connected to the magnetic pen and that's how it wrote.
Or, how the oozy white stuff kept things dispersed so it could write. And as they were leaving the room, two of them turned to me and said, "We loved that.
Me and her are going home this weekend to do more experiments.
" (Laughter) Yeah, I know, the parents in there are worried about it, but it's a good thing!
Experimenting is good, and actually I found it extremely gratifying, and I think hopefully it was very life-enriching for them.
Because, even a basic magnet is something that we can experiment with at home.
They're both simple and complex at the same time.
Or, you can take this dollar bill over here, and I can take a set of magnets, and you can see that the dollar bill gets lifted by the magnets.
Or, here I have some crushed-up bran cereal.
OK?
And that's also magnetic.
That has iron in it.
(Laughter) And that can be good for you, right?
That's not magnetic, but somehow it's interacting with a magnet.
It's easy to be overwhelmed by these amazing views, and to be really fascinated by these sometimes alien-looking formations.
To do this, they carry out a series of experiments that each can tell us a small piece of the puzzle.
In our muscle cells, actin structures form these regular filaments that look kind of like fabric.
They can be thought of as basically cellular highways that are used to move things from one side of the cell to the other.
Unlike our roads, microtubules grow and shrink, appearing when they're needed and disappearing when their job is done.
The molecular version of semitrucks are proteins aptly named motor proteins, that can walk along microtubules, dragging sometimes huge cargoes, like organelles, behind them.
This particular motor protein is known as dynein, and its known to be able to work together in groups that almost look, at least to me, like a chariot of horses.
As you see, the cell is this incredibly changing, dynamic place, where things are constantly being built and disassembled.
But some of these structures are harder to take apart than others, though.
And special forces need to be brought in in order to make sure that structures are taken apart in a timely manner.
That job is done in part by proteins like these.
These donut-shaped proteins, of which there are many types in the cell, all seem to act to rip apart structures by basically pulling individual proteins through a central hole.
When these kinds of proteins don't work properly, the types of proteins that are supposed to get taken apart can sometimes stick together and aggregate and that can give rise to terrible diseases, such as Alzheimer's.
And now let's take a look at the nucleus, which houses our genome in the form of DNA.
In all of our cells, our DNA is cared for and maintained by a diverse set of proteins.
DNA is wound around proteins called histones, which enable cells to pack large amounts of DNA into our nucleus.
These machines are called chromatin remodelers, and the way they work is that they basically scoot the DNA around these histones and they allow new pieces of DNA to become exposed.
This DNA can then be recognized by other machinery.
In this case, this large molecular machine is looking for a segment of DNA that tells it it's at the beginning of a gene.
Once it finds a segment, it basically undergoes a series of shape changes which enables it to bring in other machinery that in turn allows a gene to get turned on or transcribed.
This has to be a very tightly regulated process, because turning on the wrong gene at the wrong time can have disastrous consequences.
Scientists are now able to use protein machines to edit genomes.
I'm sure all of you have heard of CRISPR.
CRISPR takes advantage of a protein known as Cas9, which can be engineered to recognize and cut a very specific sequence of DNA.
In this example, two Cas9 proteins are being used to excise a problematic piece of DNA.
For example, a part of a gene that may give rise to a disease.
Cellular machinery is then used to basically glue two ends of the DNA back together.
As a molecular animator, one of my biggest challenges is visualizing uncertainty.
All of the animations I've shown to you represent hypotheses, how my collaborators think a process works, based on the best information that they have.
But for a lot of molecular processes, we're still really at the early stages of understanding things, and there's a lot to learn.
The truth is that these invisible molecular worlds are vast and largely unexplored.
To me, these molecular landscapes are just as exciting to explore as a natural world that's visible all around us.
Thank you.
(Applause)I live in Utah, a place known for having some of the most awe-inspiring natural landscapes on this planet.
It's easy to be overwhelmed by these amazing views, and to be really fascinated by these sometimes alien-looking formations.
As a scientist, I love observing the natural world.
But as a cell biologist, I'm much more interested in understanding the natural world at a much, much smaller scale.
I'm a molecular animator, and I work with other researchers to create visualizations of molecules that are so small, they're essentially invisible.
These molecules are smaller than the wavelength of light, which means that we can never see them directly, even with the best light microscopes.
So how do I create visualizations of things that are so small we can't see them?
Scientists, like my collaborators, can spend their entire professional careers working to understand one molecular process.
To do this, they carry out a series of experiments that each can tell us a small piece of the puzzle.
One kind of experiment can tell us about the protein shape, while another can tell us about what other proteins it might interact with, and another can tell us about where it can be found in a cell.
And all of these bits of information can be used to come up with a hypothesis, a story, essentially, of how a molecule might work.
My job is to take these ideas and turn them into an animation.
This can be tricky, because it turns out that molecules can do some pretty crazy things.
But these animations can be incredibly useful for researchers to communicate their ideas of how these molecules work.
They can also allow us to see the molecular world through their eyes.
I'd like to show you some animations, a brief tour of what I consider to be some of the natural wonders of the molecular world.
First off, this is an immune cell.
These kinds of cells need to go crawling around in our bodies in order to find invaders like pathogenic bacteria.
This movement is powered by one of my favorite proteins called actin, which is part of what's known as the cytoskeleton.
Unlike our skeletons, actin filaments are constantly being built and taken apart.
The actin cytoskeleton plays incredibly important roles in our cells.
They allow them to change shape, to move around, to adhere to surfaces and also to gobble up bacteria.
Actin is also involved in a different kind of movement.
In our muscle cells, actin structures form these regular filaments that look kind of like fabric.
When our muscles contract, these filaments are pulled together and they go back to their original position when our muscles relax.
Other parts of the cytoskeleton, in this case microtubules, are responsible for long-range transportation.
They can be thought of as basically cellular highways that are used to move things from one side of the cell to the other.
Unlike our roads, microtubules grow and shrink, appearing when they're needed and disappearing when their job is done.
The molecular version of semitrucks are proteins aptly named motor proteins, that can walk along microtubules, dragging sometimes huge cargoes, like organelles, behind them.

And I'm now happily married to my actual second husband.
And also, what's important to us.
Because when you wait until it's broken, it's too late. But if you have them early on, they can actually help build a better marriage. Three ideas that I want to put on the table for you to consider. One, sacrifice should be thought of as a fair exchange.
Take the example of Lisa and Andy.
Lisa decides to go to medical school early in the marriage, and Andy works to support them.
He does this out of love.
" A couple of years go by, she graduates from medical school, and she files for a divorce.
And at that point, that mediator might have asked, "How exactly does fair exchange work?
Deb leaves behind an extended family, her friends and a job that she really liked.
Now, the marriage mediator who would have come in before they moved and before Deb quit her job might have asked them, "What do your choices about childcare do to the obligations you have to each other?
" If the two of them had thought about their split beforehand, what would have gone differently?
So, let's go back to Lisa and Andy.
And then Andy of course worked to make the mortgage payments.
And all of their premarital and marital property became joined.
That inheritance is now marital property.
So, in a split, what's going to happen?
So this marriage mediator, if they had talked to them before all of this happened, that person would have asked, "What do you want to keep separate and what do you want to keep together?
" So if they had thought about their split, maybe they would have decided differently, maybe Lisa would have thought, "Maybe the inheritance can stay separate," and saved for a day when they might actually need it.
And maybe the mortgage that they took on wouldn't have been as onerous, and maybe Andy wouldn't have had to work so hard to make those payments.
And maybe he would have become less resentful.
Maybe they would have lived in a smaller house and been content to do that.
The point is, if they had had a divorce-conscious discussion about what to keep separate, their marriage might have been more connected and more together.
Too often in marriage, we make sacrifices, and we demand them, without reckoning their cost.
But there is wisdom in looking at the price tags attached to our marital decisions in just the way that divorce law teaches us to do.
What I want is for people to think about their marital bargains through the lens of divorce.
And to ask, "How is marriage a sacrifice, but an exchange of sacrifice?
How do we think about our exchange?
" Second: "How do we think about childcare and deal with the fact that there is no such thing as free childcare?
" "How do we deal with the fact that some things can be separate and some things can be together, and if we don't think about it, then it will all be part of the joint enterprise.
" So basically, what I want to leave you with is that in marriage or divorce, people should think about the way that "till death do us part" marriage is forever.
Thank you.
" Because spouses are bound together by their decisions, in marriage and in divorce.
So, a mentor of mine once told me, "You should always marry your second husband first. " (Laughter) What did that mean?
It didn't mean that Mr. Right is somehow waiting behind door number two.
It meant that if you want to understand what makes a marriage work, you should think about how a marriage ends.
Divorce makes extremely explicit what the tacit rules of marriage are.
And I'm now happily married to my actual second husband.
(Laughter) The reason that I think this is so important is that I think everyone should be having some of these very painful conversations that divorced people experience.
These are painful conversations about what we contributed, what we owe, what we are willing to give and what we give up.
And also, what's important to us.
Those conversations should be happening in a good marriage, not after it is broken.
Because when you wait until it's broken, it's too late. But if you have them early on, they can actually help build a better marriage. Three ideas that I want to put on the table for you to consider. One, sacrifice should be thought of as a fair exchange.
Two, there's no such thing as free childcare.
And three, what's yours probably becomes ours.
So let me talk about each of these ideas.
The first one, sacrifice should be a fair exchange.
Take the example of Lisa and Andy.
Lisa decides to go to medical school early in the marriage, and Andy works to support them.
And Andy works night shifts in order to do that, and he also gives up a great job in another city.
He does this out of love.
But of course, he also understands that Lisa's degree will benefit them both in the end. But after a few years, Andy becomes neglected and resentful.
And he starts drinking heavily.
And Lisa looks at her life and she looks at Andy and she thinks, "This is not the bargain I wanted to make.
" A couple of years go by, she graduates from medical school, and she files for a divorce.
So in my perfect world, some kind of marriage mediator would have been able to talk to them before Lisa went to medical school.
And at that point, that mediator might have asked, "How exactly does fair exchange work?
What does it look like in your marriage?
What are you willing to give and what are you willing to owe?
" So in a divorce, Lisa now probably is going to owe Andy financial support for years.
And Andy . . . no amount of financial support is going to make him feel compensated for what he gave up, and the lost traction in his career. If the two of them had thought about their split early on, what might have gone differently?
Well, it's possible that Lisa would have decided that she would take loans or work a part-time job in order to support her own tuition so that Andy wouldn't have had to bear the entire burden for that.
And Andy might have decided to take that job in that other city and maybe the two of them would have commuted for a couple of years while Lisa finished her degree.
So let's take another couple, Emily and Deb.
They live in a big city, they have two children, they both work.
Emily gets a job in a small town, and they decide to move there together.
And Deb quits her job to look after the children full-time.
Deb leaves behind an extended family, her friends and a job that she really liked.
And in that small town, Deb starts to feel isolated and lonely.
And 10 years later, Deb has an affair, and things fall apart.
Now, the marriage mediator who would have come in before they moved and before Deb quit her job might have asked them, "What do your choices about childcare do to the obligations you have to each other?
How do they affect your relationship?
Because you have to remember that there is no such thing as free childcare.
" If the two of them had thought about their split beforehand, what would have gone differently?
Well, maybe Deb would have realized a little better how much her family and her friends were important to her precisely in what she was taking on, which is full-time parenthood.
Perhaps Emily, in weighing the excitement of the new job offer might have also thought about what that would mean for the cost to Deb and what would be owed to Deb as a result of her taking on full-time parenthood.
So, let's go back to Lisa and Andy.
Lisa had an inheritance from her grandmother before the marriage.
And when they got married, they bought a home, and Lisa put that inheritance toward a down payment on that home.
And then Andy of course worked to make the mortgage payments.
And all of their premarital and marital property became joined.
That inheritance is now marital property.
So, in a split, what's going to happen?
They're going to have to sell the house and split the proceeds, or one of them can buy the other out.
So this marriage mediator, if they had talked to them before all of this happened, that person would have asked, "What do you want to keep separate and what do you want to keep together?
And how does that choice actually support the security of the marriage?
Because you have to remember that what's yours, probably, will become ours, unless you actually are mindful and take steps to do otherwise.
" So if they had thought about their split, maybe they would have decided differently, maybe Lisa would have thought, "Maybe the inheritance can stay separate," and saved for a day when they might actually need it.
And maybe the mortgage that they took on wouldn't have been as onerous, and maybe Andy wouldn't have had to work so hard to make those payments.
And maybe he would have become less resentful.
Maybe they would have lived in a smaller house and been content to do that.
The point is, if they had had a divorce-conscious discussion about what to keep separate, their marriage might have been more connected and more together.
Too often in marriage, we make sacrifices, and we demand them, without reckoning their cost.
But there is wisdom in looking at the price tags attached to our marital decisions in just the way that divorce law teaches us to do.
What I want is for people to think about their marital bargains through the lens of divorce.
And to ask, "How is marriage a sacrifice, but an exchange of sacrifice?
How do we think about our exchange?
" Second: "How do we think about childcare and deal with the fact that there is no such thing as free childcare?
" "How do we deal with the fact that some things can be separate and some things can be together, and if we don't think about it, then it will all be part of the joint enterprise.
Autism is something that many people know about.
For example, some people think that autistic people are fair-skinned males that speak in monotone and constantly go on and on about the same topic.
Some people think that autistic people do not know right from wrong, avoid attention and usually say the wrong thing at the wrong time.
Now if you agree with what I just said, I'm sorry to tell you, but you do not have the right impression of autism.
How do I know?
However, there is not a lot of information out there on what an autistic life actually looks like, so people often resort to stereotypes.
And we see these often in the media.
Did you know that some people are trying to find a cure for autism?
Many people are challenging the idea and to us, we think autism is not a disease.
Our brains function differently from most people's brains.
Think of it like comparing and Xbox and a PlayStation.
Were there lots of conversations happening all at once?
And that is why I don't show as much empathy as my nonautistic friends do.
My mother.
And I may not think like you, or act like you, but I am still human and I am not diseased.
Thank you.
(Applause)Autism is something that many people know about.
For example, some people think that autistic people are fair-skinned males that speak in monotone and constantly go on and on about the same topic.
Some people think that autistic people do not know right from wrong, avoid attention and usually say the wrong thing at the wrong time.
Some people think that autistic people are socially awkward and lack humor and empathy.
Now if you agree with what I just said, I'm sorry to tell you, but you do not have the right impression of autism.
How do I know?
Because I have autism.
I do have my own obsessions with things like electronics and public transit, but that does not define me.
Each of us are different and unique in our own way.
However, there is not a lot of information out there on what an autistic life actually looks like, so people often resort to stereotypes.
And we see these often in the media.
Some of the more common stereotypes in the media include being socially awkward, lacking empathy and even being a supergenius.
And the lack of knowledge on autism doesn't stop there either.
Did you know that some people are trying to find a cure for autism?
That's because they see it as a negative thing, as a disease.
Many people are challenging the idea and to us, we think autism is not a disease.
It's just another way of thinking and looking at the world.
Our brains function differently from most people's brains.
Think of it like comparing and Xbox and a PlayStation.
They're both highly capable consoles with different programming.
But if you put your Xbox game in a PlayStation, it won't work, because the PlayStation communicates differently.
When I look in the mirror, I see someone who thinks differently.
Oh, and I also see nice hair.
(Laughter) (Applause) But the question is, am I really diseased if I just think differently?
The main problem with living autistic in today's society is that the world just isn't built for us.
There's so many ways that we can get overwhelmed.
For example, the thing that makes me overwhelmed all the time is loud noises, which means I never crank up my music really loud and I usually am not a fan of large parties.
But other people on the spectrum might get overwhelmed with things like bright lights or strong smells or gooey textures that all have the potential to create anxiety.
Think about all of the social gatherings you've been to in the past.
Was there loud music playing?
Were there really bright lights?
Were there lots of different food smells going on at the same time?
Were there lots of conversations happening all at once?
Those things may not have bothered you guys, but for someone with autism, they can be quite overwhelming.
So in those situations, we do something called stimming, which is like a repetitive motion or a noise or some other random fidgeting that may or may not seem normal.
Some people will flap their arms or make a noise or spin.
Ya, it's basically our way of zoning out.
It can often feel necessary for us to stim.
However, it's often frowned upon, and we're forced to hide it.
When we're forced to hide our autistic traits like this, it's called masking.
And some people mask better than others.
I mask so well sometimes that people don't even know I'm autistic until I give them the big reveal.
(Laughs) But at the end of the day, it gets really stressful.
Even something like doing my homework at night becomes very tiring.
Some people think, because of our ability to mask, that this is the cure to autism.
However, all it really does is makes us ashamed of showing our true selves.
Another common stereotype that is often associated with autism is that autistic people lack empathy.
And again, this is not true.
I actually have lots of empathy.
I'm just not really good at showing it.
Whenever a friend is trying to tell me some of the struggles that they're going through, I often don't know how to express my reply.
And that is why I don't show as much empathy as my nonautistic friends do.
Emotional expression, however much or however little, is difficult for me.
And that is because I am bursting inside with every single emotion one feels at all times.
Though of course, I cannot express it that way.
Otherwise, let's say, happiness, for example, would come out as a huge burst of gleeful wheezing, hand flapping and loud vocal "woohoos.
" (Laughter) Whereas you may just smile.
(Laughter) Whether it be receiving an awesome birthday gift or listening to a tragic story on the news, I cannot really express my reply without bursting, so once again, I have to mask it in order to appear normal.
My inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me express extremes or nothing.
So my . . . I am not great with my emotions, and I communicate differently, and because of that, I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
This diagnosis helps me and my friends and family to know how my mind works.
And in the world, approximately one percent of the population is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
And this number is growing.
However, we are still a big minority.
And there's still lots of people that do not see us as equals to other people.
This is my family.
And in my family, there is one other person who is also autistic.
My mother.
Yes, adult women can also be autistic.
Sometimes it can be a bit difficult for us to communicate with each other, however.
Sometimes I'll say something like, "Oh, Toronto's Union Station, right?
" thinking that I can help them to remember certain aspects of it.
When they get confused, I often have to elaborate myself on that.
And we often have to say things in a number of different ways so that everyone understands.
However, despite all that, we all love each other and respect each other as equals.
In his book "NeuroTribes," author Steve Silberman states that autism and other mental conditions should be seen as naturally human, naturally part of a human spectrum and not as defects.
And I may not think like you, or act like you, but I am still human and I am not diseased.
Thank you.
If you ask me about my life as an expatriate, I would say that I've been lucky.
But it hasn't been easy.
We knew things were getting bad, but we never saw what was coming: an economic crisis, infrastructure breaking down, citywide electrical blackouts, the decline of public health care and shortage of medicines, disease outbreaks and starvation.
A lot of my friends are Venezuelan immigrants, and in the last few years, we've begun talking about how we could make a difference when we live so far away.
They track available personnel, medical supplies, mortality data, disease outbreaks; compile it into a report; and then share that on Twitter.
In that first hackathon, we had 300 participants from seven countries come up with 16 different project submissions.
We picked the projects with the most potential and continued working on them after the event.
They're called MediTweet and Blackout Tracker.
My mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2015. She needed to have a lumbar puncture to get a final diagnosis and treatment plan. But the needle for this procedure wasn't available.
I was in Venezuela at that time, and I was seeing my mom getting worse in front of me every day. After looking everywhere, we found the needle in a site that is like the eBay of Latin America.
I met the seller in a local bakery, and it was like buying something on the black market.
It's easy for them to deny that the problem exists or make excuses, because there is no official data on it.
But that is the point.
These projects are not insanely advanced, but it's what the people of Venezuela need, and they can have a tremendous impact.
Beyond these projects, perhaps our most significant accomplishment is that a movement has been created, one where people around the world are coming together to use their professional skills to create solutions for the people of Venezuela.
And because we are partnering with locals, we are creating the solutions that people want and need.
What is so great about this is that we are using our professional skills, so it comes easily and naturally.
It's not that hard for us to make a difference.
If someone from San Francisco were to hire professionals to create solutions like MediTweet or Blackout Tracker, it would cost a small fortune.
By donating our services, we are making a bigger impact than if we were just to donate money. And you can do the same thing -- not in Venezuela, necessarily, but in your own community.
Anyone with knowledge and professional skills has a powerful force to bring hope to a community.
For us at Code for Venezuela, this is just the beginning.
Thank you.
(Applause)I'm an immigrant from Venezuela, and I've lived in the US for six years.
If you ask me about my life as an expatriate, I would say that I've been lucky.
But it hasn't been easy.
Growing up, I never thought that I was going to leave my homeland.
I participated in my first student protest in 2007, when the president shut down one of the most important news networks.
I was getting my bachelor's degree in communications, and that was the first time I realized I couldn't take free speech for granted.
We knew things were getting bad, but we never saw what was coming: an economic crisis, infrastructure breaking down, citywide electrical blackouts, the decline of public health care and shortage of medicines, disease outbreaks and starvation.
I moved to Canada with my husband in 2013, and we always thought we'd move back home when the crisis improved.
But we never did.
Nearly all my childhood friends have left the country, but my parents are still there.
There have been moments where I've called my mom, and I could hear people screaming and crying in the background as teargas bombs exploded in the streets.
And my mom, as if I couldn't hear it, would always tell me, (Speaking Spanish) "We're fine, don't worry.
" But of course, I worry.
It's my parents, and I'm 4,000 miles away.
Today, I'm just one of more than four million Venezuelans who have left their home country.
A lot of my friends are Venezuelan immigrants, and in the last few years, we've begun talking about how we could make a difference when we live so far away.
That is how Code for Venezuela was born in 2019. It began with a hackathon, because we are experts in tech, and we thought we could use our tech skills to create solutions for people on the ground.
But first, we needed to find some experts actually living inside Venezuela to guide us. We'd see so many other hackathons that came up with wily, ambitious, incredible technological solutions that sounded great in theory but ultimately failed to work in the actual countries they were intended to help.
They track available personnel, medical supplies, mortality data, disease outbreaks; compile it into a report; and then share that on Twitter.
He became our go-to expert on health care in Venezuela.
Luis Carlos Díaz, a widely recognized journalist who reports acts of censorship and human rights violations suffered by the people of Venezuela, he helps us make sense of what is happening there, since the news is controlled by the government. We call these people our heroes on the ground.
With their expert advice, we came up with a series of challenges for hackathon participants.
In that first hackathon, we had 300 participants from seven countries come up with 16 different project submissions.
We picked the projects with the most potential and continued working on them after the event.
Today, I'll share two of our most successful projects to give you a taste of the impact we are having so far.
They're called MediTweet and Blackout Tracker.
MediTweet is an intelligent Twitter bot that helps Venezuelans find the medicine they need.
Right now in Venezuela, if you get sick and you go to a hospital, there is a good chance they won't have the right medical supplies to treat you. The situation is so bad that patients often get a "shopping list" from the doctor instead of a prescription.
I live the need for this firsthand.
My mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2015. She needed to have a lumbar puncture to get a final diagnosis and treatment plan. But the needle for this procedure wasn't available.
I was in Venezuela at that time, and I was seeing my mom getting worse in front of me every day. After looking everywhere, we found the needle in a site that is like the eBay of Latin America.
I met the seller in a local bakery, and it was like buying something on the black market.
My mom brought the needle to her doctor, and he did the procedure.
Without this, she could have died.
But it's not just medical supplies, it's medicines, too.
When she was first diagnosed, we bought her treatment in a state pharmacy, and it was, like, practically free.
But then the state pharmacy ran out, and we still had six months of treatment ahead. Six months of treatment ahead.
" Our Twitter bot scans Twitter for the hashtag #ServicioPublico and connects users who are asking for specific medicines with those who are selling their private leftovers.
We also pool the location data of those Twitter users and use it for a visualization tool.
It gives local organizations like Médicos por la Salud a sense of where they have a shortage.
We can also apply machine learning algorithms to detect clusters of disease.
If they've received humanitarian aid, this could help them to make better decisions about the distributions of the supplies.
Our second project, is called Blackout Tracker.
Venezuela is currently going through an electricity crisis. Last year, Venezuela suffered what some people consider the worst power failures in Venezuelan history.
I had two long days without communication with my parents.
Some cities experienced blackouts every day.
But you only know about this on social media.
The government won't report blackouts on the news.
When the power goes out, many Venezuelans, we quickly tweet out the location with the hashtag #SinLuz, meaning "without electricity," before their phones ran out of battery, so people around the country know what is happening.
Like MediTweet, Blackout Tracker scans Twitter for the hashtag #SinLuz and creates a map using the location data of those users. You can quickly see where the blackouts are happening today and how many blackouts have happened over time.
People want to know what is happening, and this is our answer.
But it's also a way of holding the government accountable.
It's easy for them to deny that the problem exists or make excuses, because there is no official data on it.
Blackout Tracker shows how bad the problem really is.
Now, some people in Silicon Valley may look at these projects and say that there are no major technological innovations.
But that is the point.
These projects are not insanely advanced, but it's what the people of Venezuela need, and they can have a tremendous impact.
Beyond these projects, perhaps our most significant accomplishment is that a movement has been created, one where people around the world are coming together to use their professional skills to create solutions for the people of Venezuela.
And because we are partnering with locals, we are creating the solutions that people want and need.
What is so great about this is that we are using our professional skills, so it comes easily and naturally.
It's not that hard for us to make a difference.
If someone from San Francisco were to hire professionals to create solutions like MediTweet or Blackout Tracker, it would cost a small fortune.
By donating our services, we are making a bigger impact than if we were just to donate money. And you can do the same thing -- not in Venezuela, necessarily, but in your own community.
Anyone with knowledge and professional skills has a powerful force to bring hope to a community.
For us at Code for Venezuela, this is just the beginning.
Thank you.

OK. So we are going to start in 1891, when a German scientist was looking through a microscope at insect cells. And he saw something kind of funny. At the center of the cells, there was this dark stuff.
No one had ever seen it before.
And he noticed that as the cells would multiply and divide, it would go into some of the new cells but not the others.
He didn't know what it was, so he gave it a really great name. He called it the "X element. " (Laughter) And he was like, "We'll just fill in that X later.
" And then, fast-forward 10 years later, and there is an American scientist, and she is looking through her microscope, also at insect cells.
And she sees something funny.
There's more of this dark stuff.
And it's kind of tiny, it's hanging out near the X element. And eventually, someone was like, "Well, if that one thing's called X, should we call this other thing Y?
So within years of being discovered, these two little chromosomes had acquired more than 10 different names.
There was a fear that it would actually be really limiting -- maybe to science, maybe to society -- but the fear was in the room. And you can see they ended up getting "sex chromosome" -- it's like a pretty juicy title, it popularized genetics, you know?
So these are XXY, as opposed to XYY.(Audio) MW: Really?(Audio) SR: Yeah. Now, they never claimed that the individuals with an extra X chromosome were superfemales. They never investigated whether they had higher rates of violence. MW: Seems like kind of an oversight.
Or if we are, like, maybe we all like that name, should we just allow ourselves to think about them a little more broadly?
Because if we do, like, what insights would we gain, as people, as scientists?
Thank you. (Applause)
So what do people usually say when you're about to give a public talk?
It's to imagine that your audience is naked.
(Laughter) Well, I'm doing a different trick tonight, and I'm going to imagine all of us without farmers, and well, it's not so much different.
[Without farmers you'd be hungry, naked and sober] (Laughter) And our farmers do so much more for us than simply feed and clothe and provide us excellent things to drink.
Our farmers are an important part of all of our communities, particularly our rural communities.
And more than that, they're a strong driver of resilient economics.
Think about it this way: When a brewer buys hops from me, grown here in Minnesota, 90 percent of that dollar stays in our state, compared to just 10 percent when they buy it from somewhere else.
It means tax revenue for better schools and roads. It means support for the co-ops, the mechanics, all the support staff that are needed for a farm to thrive.
And they're our best stewards of the land.
"That land is a community is the basic concept of ecology, but that land is to be loved and respected as an extension of ethics.
We'll try again with bread.
Average retail price of bread in America, three forty-nine.
Farmer gets . . . Twelve cents. Audience: Oh!
And so how are we supposed to have strong local farms in this scenario?
What are we supposed to do if there aren't any local farmers left?
And this isn't just a farmer problem, it's not just something for the few of us farmers to sort out. This is an all-of-us problem. This is rural and it's urban and it's statewide and it's nationwide.
So what do we do about it?
I'll tell you that. But first, a story.
The green movement, we're all kind of familiar, started in the '60s, planting trees. And now we've come such a long way. Green is part of our day-to-day lives.
It's part of the day-to-day lives of Fortune 500 businesses. It's the subject of international treaties, the subject of presidential debates.
You and I, we switch our light bulbs, we use reusable bags. We participate in the green movement each and every day. Yet . . . and this is how we get to the idea -- the food movement, relatively younger, but also somewhat familiar, I imagine.
And that's all well and good, but where are we going?How do we get to our renewable-energy moment like the green movement did?
We also need to show up at the ballot box for our farmers. This is bigger than just buying local strawberries once a year at a pick-your-own. This is a year-round effort that we must make together to make the change we need. Changes like fair pricing for farmers.
That's quotas, supply management, guaranteed prices.Changes like fair and open trade.That means ending trade wars. And yeah, of course it means voting. Now we all knew that one already, though. For example, it's working.
Hey, who's that?
(Laughter) Just this year in Minnesota, we've passed a historic, first-in-the-country tax credit. The Beginning Farmer Tax Credit.
If we can do it, anybody can do it.Now, that was all light and fuzzy and feels pretty happy.Skeptics in the audience, you're here. That would be me, if I were here. Skeptics are thinking, "Wow, what do we need to change about our food system?
We have unlimited food, and it's real cheap, too, isn't that great?
Well, unfortunately, in the '80s and the '90s in this country, we went down a path of policy that could be described as "get big or get out. " And what "get big or get out" means is you maximize production while minimizing costs.
When it used to only take 40. We know what happens, we read about it in the news. Broadly determined, rural decline, but schools close, schools consolidate, post offices close, grocery stores close.
People leave, the community suffers and goes away.
I believe all of us in this audience with ties to rural Minnesota know this story well.
This is not a problem that we can solve with farmers markets and good intentions. We have to do more for our farmers.
Policy got us into this mess, and policy can get us out. American farmers are only getting older, fewer and poorer, yet they are crucial to our state. They're the vibrancy in our rural communities.
They're the drivers of economic growth and stability, and they are our best protectors of our shared resources of land, water and air. So we have to do better for them. So join me, would you?
Let's fight for our farmers.You can see it, we're already doing it in Minnesota, having great success. And together, we can do even more. And we must. So we were voting with our fork before, and we want to keep doing that.
] [From infectious disease expert Adam Kucharski] [Question 1: What does containment mean when it comes to outbreaks?
So it's a very focused, targeted method, and for SARS, it worked remarkably well.
But I think for this infection, because some cases are going to be missed, or undetected, you've really got to be capturing a large chunk of people at risk.
If a few slip through the net, potentially, you're going to get an outbreak.
[Question 2: If containment isn't enough, what comes next?
] In that respect, it would be about massive changes in our social interactions.
And so that would require, of the opportunities that could spread the virus so these kind of close contacts, everybody in the population, on average, will be needing to reduce those interactions potentially by two-thirds to bring it under control.
That might be through working from home, from changing lifestyle and kind of where you go in crowded places and dinners.
And of course, these measures, things like school closures, and other things that just attempt to reduce the social mixing of a population.
[Question 3: What are the risks that we need people to think about?
] It's not just whose hand you shake, it's whose hand that person goes on to shake.
And I think we need to think about these second-degree steps, that you might think you have low risk and you're in a younger group, but you're often going to be a very short step away from someone who is going to get hit very hard by this.
And I think we really need to be socially minded and think this could be quite dramatic in terms of change of behavior, but it needs to be to reduce the impact that we're potentially facing.
[Question 4: How far apart should people stay from each other?
] I think it's hard to pin down exactly, but I think one thing to bear in mind is that there's not so much evidence that this is a kind of aerosol and it goes really far -- it's reasonably short distances.
I don't think it's the case that you're sitting a few meters away from someone and the virus is somehow going to get across.
It's in closer interactions, and it's why we're seeing so many transmission events occur in things like meals and really tight-knit groups.
Because if you imagine that's where you can get a virus out and onto surfaces and onto hands and onto faces, and it's really situations like that we've got to think more about.
[Question 5: What kind of protective measures should countries put in place?
] [From infectious disease expert Adam Kucharski] [Question 1: What does containment mean when it comes to outbreaks?

[Question 5: What kind of protective measures should countries put in place?
Menstruation. A simple word describing a natural biological process, weighed down by centuries of stigma, has been transformed into something most of us can only speak about in whispers.
But why?
As I speak to you right now, more than 800 million women around the world are having a period.
None of us would exist without it, and yet it remains an "embarrassing" subject to broach. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting.
It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible.
What about 335 million girls around the world who go to school without even having access to water and soap to wash their hands?
What about 15-year-old schoolgirls in Kenya who have to sell their bodies to be able to buy sanitary napkins?
What about two-thirds of rural high school girls in India who don't even understand what their bodies are going through at menarche?
And right now, we are all gathered here in the USA. So what about 64 percent of women in St. Louis, Missouri, who weren't able to afford menstrual hygiene supplies in the previous year?
What about the struggles of homeless, transgender, intersex and displaced people who menstruate? What about them?

(Whale chirps and squeaks) They make these fantastic sounds not just to communicate, but also sometimes to echolocate, to find their way around and to find food.
But that can be tricky sometimes, because, well, here is the sound of a ship passing by, recorded underwater.
(Screeching oscillating sound) You know, when we think about marine pollution, I think we usually think about plastics. Maybe toxic chemicals, or even ocean acidification from climate change.
As a science journalist who often writes about environmental issues, those are the things that have passed my desk over the past 10 years or so.
This is important.
It can cause chronic stress, or even physical injury.
That might not sound like a lot, but decibels are on a logarithmic scale, like the Richter scale for earthquakes.
We do know some things. We know that sonar can be as loud, or nearly as loud, as an underwater volcano.
And whenever the workers stopped for a moment, I could feel my shoulders relax.
This effect has been seen in whales, too.
" Now you have to remember, we have evolved to be a visual species.
We really rely on our eyes.
You know, weirdly, a lot of the noise from a ship like this comes from the popping of tiny bubbles off the back of its propeller.
People have also invented quieter ways of hammering in the giant posts needed for giant wind turbines, like this one, and gentler ways of doing seismic surveys.
And there are some incentives for using quieter technologies. The European Union, for example, has a healthy marine system directive for 2020. And one of the ways that they define a healthy marine system is by how much noise is going in those waters.
But on the whole, most waters remain completely unregulated when it comes to ocean noise.
But again, most of the scientists I spoke to said that there's real momentum right now in policy circles to pay attention to this issue and maybe do something about this issue.
We already know enough to say that quieter seas are healthier seas.
But now scientists are really scrambling to come up with the details. Just how quiet do we need to be?
And where are the best places to make quiet or preserve quiet?
And how best can we hush our noise?
And this day, apparently, is very strictly observed.
No planes take off from the airport, no boats go out fishing, the tourists are gently led off the beach back into their hotel rooms.
Now he and other researchers can go back to this place and see what the fish choose to do with all this additional acoustic real estate. (Soft bubbling) I like to think of them having their own holiday, feasting and finding mates.
Celebrating their own spot of calm in an otherwise noisy world. Thank you.
(Applause)This is the sound of orcas off the coast of Vancouver.
(Whale chirps and squeaks) They make these fantastic sounds not just to communicate, but also sometimes to echolocate, to find their way around and to find food.
But that can be tricky sometimes, because, well, here is the sound of a ship passing by, recorded underwater.
(Screeching oscillating sound) You know, when we think about marine pollution, I think we usually think about plastics. Maybe toxic chemicals, or even ocean acidification from climate change.
As a science journalist who often writes about environmental issues, those are the things that have passed my desk over the past 10 years or so.
Well, in much the same way, there are people now raising awareness of the issue of noise pollution and trying to create pockets of quiet in the ocean, so that marine life can enjoy a more natural soundscape.
This is important.
Noise isn't just an irritation.
It can cause chronic stress, or even physical injury.
It can affect marine life's ability to find food and mates and to listen out for predators and more. Think of all the sounds we inject into the ocean.
Perhaps one of the most dramatic is the seismic surveys used to look for oil and gas.
Air guns produce loud blasts, sometimes every 10 to 15 seconds, for months on end. And they use the reflections of these sounds to map the ground beneath.
It can sound like this. (Explosion sounds) Then, there's the sound of the actual drilling for oil and gas, the construction of things like offshore wind farms, sonar and of course, the nearly constant drone from more than 50,000 ships in the global merchant fleet.
Now the natural ocean itself isn't exactly quiet.
If you put your head under the water, you can hear cracking ice, wind, rain, singing whales, grunting fish, even snapping shrimp.
Altogether, that can create a soundscape of maybe 50 to 100 decibels, depending on where and when you are. But mankind's addition to that has been dramatic.
It's estimated that shipping has added three decibels of noise to the ocean every 10 years in recent decades.
That might not sound like a lot, but decibels are on a logarithmic scale, like the Richter scale for earthquakes.
So a small number can actually represent a large change. Three decibels means a doubling of noise intensity in the ocean.
A doubling.
And that's only an estimate, because no one is actually keeping track of how noisy the ocean is all around the world. There is a body called the International Quiet Ocean Experiment, and one of their missions is to try and plug the hole in that data.
So for example, last year, they managed to convince the Global Ocean Observation System to start including noise as one of their essential variables for monitoring, alongside things like temperature and salinity.
We do know some things. We know that sonar can be as loud, or nearly as loud, as an underwater volcano.
So what does all this sound like to marine life, what do they hear?
It's kind of difficult to describe.
So what does this mean, what is the impact on all this marine life?Perhaps the easiest thing for scientists to assess is the effect of acute noise, really loud sudden blasts that might cause physical injury or hearing loss.
Well, what about chronic noise, the more pervasive issue of raising background noise from things like shipping?
Chronic noise can affect people too, of course. Studies have shown that people living near busy airports or really busy highways may have elevated levels of cardiovascular disease. And students living under busy flight paths may do worse on some educational tests.
And even while I was researching this subject, they were actually blasting out about three meters of solid granite from the lot across from my home office to make room for a new house, and the constant jittering of the rock hammer was driving me completely insane.
We really rely on our eyes.
You know, weirdly, a lot of the noise from a ship like this comes from the popping of tiny bubbles off the back of its propeller.
People have also invented quieter ways of hammering in the giant posts needed for giant wind turbines, like this one, and gentler ways of doing seismic surveys.
We already know enough to say that quieter seas are healthier seas.
But now scientists are really scrambling to come up with the details. Just how quiet do we need to be?
And when we moved to a new office, we didn't have furniture for a while, so we set up the phone on a trash can.
Paper processes are also slower and more prone to errors.
We worked with the Small Business Administration to move one of their systems from paper to digital.
So this is a picture from before, and this is afterwards.
Well, we work for the government, so we wrote a letter that said, "You can use this public-domain form on a cake for celebratory purposes.
" (Laughter) Which led to bad jokes about filling forms out in triplicake.
Yes, dad jokes in government.
Now I've talked a lot about paper, but we also bring up computer systems that go down.
We bring in modern technology practices, like user-centered design and the cloud, and we also help improve procurement.
It turns out government buys software the same way that it buys chairs and brownies and tanks: from government regulations that are over 1,000 pages long. So yes, there's some stuff that's messed up in government right now.
But if you think Silicon Valley is the savior in this story, (Laughs) you've got another thing coming.
Some of the best and brightest minds in technology are working on meal-delivery start-ups and scooters and how to deliver weed to people better.
Is that really the most important thing to work on right now?
Silicon Valley likes to talk about making the world a better place.
But you feel your impact in a much more visceral way in government.
This is somebody whose dad passed away.
He hunted me down on Twitter to say that a system that we had improved worked well for him during a tough time.
Those tough times are when government needs to work well and why we need innovation in government.
Now I have a confession to make.
When I came to DC, I sometimes used words like bureaucrat.
These days, I'm much more likely to use words like civil servant.
Like Francine, who can make you cry. Or at least, she made me cry, because she's so inspiring.
I am also deeply, fiercely proud of my colleagues.
They will work through illogical situations and put in late nights to get to the right result.
The government can't pay huge salary bonuses, so we ended up making our own awards.
Our mascot is a crab named Molly. And so that award is actually a crab-shaped purse, screwed into sheet metal.
These days, I believe less in silver bullets that are going to fix everything.
I believe more in the people who show up to help.
If you're looking for something deeply meaningful -- and full disclosure, sometimes incredibly frustrating -- here's what you need to know. There is something difficult and messy and vital and magical happening when civil servants partner with technologists at the city and state and national level.
You don't have to do it forever.
But you can make a difference in public service right now.
Thank you.
(Applause)Hi everybody. My name is Matt Cutts, and I worked at Google for almost 17 years.
As a distinguished engineer there, I was pretty close to the top of the Silicon Valley ecosystem.
Then I decided to follow some inspiring folks and do a short tour at the US Digital Service.
That's the group of geeks that helped rescue HealthCare. gov when that website went down hard in 2013. Yeah.
So I signed up for a three-to-six-month tour, and almost three years later, I'm still in Washington DC, working for the federal government, because the government really needs technologists right now.
At my old job, every room had videoconferencing integrated with calendars, power cables were built right into the furniture.
When I moved to a government agency, I had to call a person to set up a phone conference.
And when we moved to a new office, we didn't have furniture for a while, so we set up the phone on a trash can.
One of the things that surprised me, whenever I moved to DC, is how much the government still has to deal with paper.
This is a facility in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where people were worried that the building might be structurally unsound from the weight of all that paper. Yeah. Paper has some downsides.
Here's a pop quiz: If your last name starts with H or higher, H or higher, would you raise your hand? Wow. I have some bad news: Your veteran records might have been destroyed in a fire in 1973. (Laughter) Yeah.
Paper processes are also slower and more prone to errors.
If you're a veteran and you're applying for your health benefits using a paper form, you might have to wait months for that form to be processed.
We replaced that with a web form, and now most veterans find out if they can get access to their health benefits in 10 minutes.
(Applause) Here's another launch that I'm proud of.
We worked with the Small Business Administration to move one of their systems from paper to digital.
So this is a picture from before, and this is afterwards.
Same cubicles, same people, just a better system for everyone.
At one point, we wanted to celebrate modernizing a different system, and so we went to a local grocery store and we said, "Can you make a cake and decorate it with the form that we've digitized?
" And the grocery store got really weirded out by that request.
They wanted a letter on official government letterhead.
Well, we work for the government, so we wrote a letter that said, "You can use this public-domain form on a cake for celebratory purposes.
" (Laughter) Which led to bad jokes about filling forms out in triplicake.
Yes, dad jokes in government.
Now I've talked a lot about paper, but we also bring up computer systems that go down.
We bring in modern technology practices, like user-centered design and the cloud, and we also help improve procurement.
It turns out government buys software the same way that it buys chairs and brownies and tanks: from government regulations that are over 1,000 pages long. So yes, there's some stuff that's messed up in government right now.

Silicon Valley likes to talk about making the world a better place.
But you feel your impact in a much more visceral way in government.
This is somebody whose dad passed away.
Those tough times are when government needs to work well and why we need innovation in government.
I am also deeply, fiercely proud of my colleagues.
They had to overcome unbelievable pain and suffering.
This is why now I dedicate my life to education. And this is totally aligned with my sense of equity and my pursuit of social justice, because if you want to increase access to health services, you need first to increase access to health education.
(Applause) Our students are meant to go and change the world.
They will come from all over -- it's a global university -- and will get the medical education for free at one condition: they have to serve the vulnerable across the world during six to nine years.
They will keep the salary for themselves and their families but turn the education we give in quality clinical services, especially for the vulnerable. And doing so, they sign an agreement at the start that they will do that, a binding agreement.
We don't want money.
We have to go and mobilize the money.
But they will turn this in quality service delivery for all.
For this, of course, we need a strong gender equity agenda.
And in all our classes, master's course, minimum of 50 percent of women.
(Applause) And I'm proud to say that for the medical school that started five months ago, we have enrolled 70 percent girls.
(Applause) This is a statement against the current inequity for women to access medical education in our continent.
I believe in women's education.
This is why I applaud African ladies who go all over the world to increase their education, their skills and their knowledge.
But I hope they will bring that back to Africa to build the continent and make the continent a strong continent, because I'm sure a stronger Africa will make the world stronger.
But I'm so proud to have contributed to improve my community. And this makes me full of joy.
So, African women from the diaspora, if you hear me, never forget your homeland.
And when you are ready, come back home.
I did so.
It has fulfilled my life.
So, come back home.
Thank you.I came back to my home of Rwanda two years after the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.
The country was devastated.
The children I was caring for in the hospitals were dying from treatable conditions, because we didn't have equipment or medicine to save them.
I was tempted to pack my bag and run away.
But I debated with myself.
And because I'm really dedicated to social justice and equity, and there were only five pediatricians in total for millions of children in Rwanda, I decided to stay.
But among the people who have motivated my decision to stay, there were some fantastic women of Rwanda, some women who had faced the genocide and survived it.
They had to overcome unbelievable pain and suffering.
Some of them were raising children conceived through rape. Others were dying slowly with HIV and forgave the perpetrators, who voluntarily infected them using HIV and rape as a weapon.
So, they inspired me.
If they can do that, I can stay and try to do my best. Those ladies were really activists of peace and reconciliation.
(Applause) Wait till I tell you the percentage -- sixty-one percent.
(Applause) Today, we have the best campaign for the vaccination of children with, among our success, 93 percent of our girls vaccinated against HPV -- (Applause) to protect them against cervical cancer.
In this country, it's 54. (Laughter) We have reduced child mortality by 75 percent, maternal mortality by 80 percent. In early 2000s, there were nine women who were dying every day around delivery and pregnancy.
Today, it's around two.
It's an unfinished agenda.
We still have a long way to go.
Two is still too much.
So we know that women, when they use their skills in leadership positions, they enhance the entire population they are in charge of. And imagine what would happen if women were at parity with men all over the world.
What a huge benefit we could expect.
Hmm?
Gender inequity is the norm in the majority of professions, even in global health.
This is why now I dedicate my life to education. And this is totally aligned with my sense of equity and my pursuit of social justice, because if you want to increase access to health services, you need first to increase access to health education.
We have to go and mobilize the money.
But they will turn this in quality service delivery for all.
So, African women from the diaspora, if you hear me, never forget your homeland.
Thank you.
But before the astronauts began their final descent, an emergency alarm lit up.
Something was overloading the computer, and threatened to abort the landing.
Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton held her breath.
She'd led the team developing the pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission had no room for error.
But the nature of this last-second emergency would soon prove her software was working exactly as planned.
Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, Hamilton had always been inquisitive.
In college, she studied mathematics and philosophy, before taking a research position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school.
Here, she encountered her first computer while developing software to support research into the new field of chaos theory.
Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software for America’s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft.
But when she heard that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help sending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team.
NASA looked to Draper and his group of over 400 engineers to invent the first compact digital flight computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer.
Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible for guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft.
At a time when unreliable computers filled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate without any errors, and fit in one cubic foot of space.
Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware and one for developing software.
Hamilton led the team that built the on-board flight software for both the Command and Lunar Modules.
This work, for which she coined the term “software engineering," was incredibly high stakes.
Human lives were on the line, so every program had to be perfect.
Margaret’s software needed to quickly detect unexpected errors and recover from them in real time.
But this kind of adaptable program was difficult to build, since early software could only process jobs in a predetermined order.
To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program to be “asynchronous,” meaning the software's more important jobs would interrupt less important ones.
Her team assigned every task a unique priority to ensure that each job occurred in the correct order and at the right time— regardless of any surprises.
After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software could help the astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well.
She designed Priority Displays that would interrupt astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies.
The astronaut could then communicate with Mission Control to determine the best path forward.
This marked the first time flight software communicated directly— and asynchronously— with a pilot.
It was these fail safes that triggered the alarms just before the lunar landing.
Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake— he’d inadvertently flipped the rendezvous radar switch.
This radar would be essential on their journey home, but here it was using up vital computational resources.
Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer was well equipped to manage this.
During the overload, the software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs to be processed— including the programs necessary for landing.
The Priority Displays gave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land.
With minutes to spare, Mission Control gave the order.
The Apollo 11 landing was about the astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together as an integrated system of systems.
Hamilton’s contributions were essential to the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s goal to reach the Moon.
And her life-saving work went far beyond Apollo 11— no bugs were ever found in the in-flight software for any crewed Apollo missions.
After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses its unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs for systems and software.
In 2003, NASA honored her achievements with the largest financial award they’d ever given to an individual.
And 47 years after her software first guided astronauts to the moon, Hamilton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for changing the way we think about technology.At roughly 4pm on July 20, 1969, mankind was just minutes away from landing on the surface of the moon.
But before the astronauts began their final descent, an emergency alarm lit up.
Something was overloading the computer, and threatened to abort the landing.

As a result, we are becoming unconscious and unaware that it is happening at all.
Take the glasses I usually wear, for example.
These have become part of the way I ordinarily experience my surroundings.
So I asked myself, "As an artist, what can I create to draw the same kind of attention to the ways digital media -- like news organizations, social media platforms, advertising and search engines -- are shaping our reality?
We may not even realize that we've developed this kind of mental allergy.
It simulates this hypersensitivity by making red things look bigger when you are wearing it.
It's a palliative, like in digital media.
But this way of intentionally ignoring opposing ideas makes human community hyperfragmented and separated.
I picked the color red, because it's intense and emotional, it has high visibility and it's political.
In digital media, what we see every day is often mediated, but it's also very nuanced.
So I started to think of ways to put a little dirt, or change the lenses of my glasses, and came up with another project.
So what does all this mean for us?
Even though technology is creating this isolation, we could use it to make the world connected again by breaking the existing model and going beyond it.
By exploring how we interface with these technologies, we could step out of our habitual, almost machine-like behavior and finally find common ground between each other.
Technology is never neutral.
It provides a context and frames reality.
It's part of the problem and part of the solution.
We could use it to uncover our blind spots and retrain our perception and consequently, choose how we see each other.
Thank you.
(Applause)I'm an artist and an engineer.
And lately, I've been thinking a lot about how technology mediates the way we perceive reality.
And it's being done in a superinvisible and nuanced way.
Technology is designed to shape our sense of reality by masking itself as the actual experience of the world.
As a result, we are becoming unconscious and unaware that it is happening at all.
Take the glasses I usually wear, for example.
These have become part of the way I ordinarily experience my surroundings.
I barely notice them, even though they are constantly framing reality for me.
The technology I am talking about is designed to do the same thing: change what we see and think but go unnoticed.
Now, the only time I do notice my glasses is when something happens to draw my attention to it, like when it gets dirty or my prescription changes.
So I asked myself, "As an artist, what can I create to draw the same kind of attention to the ways digital media -- like news organizations, social media platforms, advertising and search engines -- are shaping our reality?
" So I created a series of perceptual machines to help us defamiliarize and question the ways we see the world.
For example, nowadays, many of us have this kind of allergic reaction to ideas that are different from ours.
We may not even realize that we've developed this kind of mental allergy.
So I created a helmet that creates this artificial allergy to the color red.
It simulates this hypersensitivity by making red things look bigger when you are wearing it.
It has two modes: nocebo and placebo.
In nocebo mode, it creates this sensorial experience of hyperallergy.
Whenever I see red, the red expands.
It's similar to social media's amplification effect, like when you look at something that bothers you, you tend to stick with like-minded people and exchange messages and memes, and you become even more angry.
Sometimes, a trivial discussion gets amplified and blown way out of proportion.
Maybe that's even why we are living in the politics of anger.
In placebo mode, it's an artificial cure for this allergy.
Whenever you see red, the red shrinks.
It's a palliative, like in digital media.
When you encounter people with different opinions, we will unfollow them, remove them completely out of our feeds.
It cures this allergy by avoiding it.
But this way of intentionally ignoring opposing ideas makes human community hyperfragmented and separated.
The device inside the helmet reshapes reality and projects into our eyes through a set of lenses to create an augmented reality.
I picked the color red, because it's intense and emotional, it has high visibility and it's political.
So what if we take a look at the last American presidential election map through the helmet?
(Laughter) You can see that it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican, because the mediation alters our perceptions.
The allergy exists on both sides.
In digital media, what we see every day is often mediated, but it's also very nuanced.
If we are not aware of this, we will keep being vulnerable to many kinds of mental allergies.
Our perception is not only part of our identities, but in digital media, it's also a part of the value chain.
Our visual field is packed with so much information that our perception has become a commodity with real estate value.
Designs are used to exploit our unconscious biases, algorithms favor content that reaffirms our opinions, so that every little corner of our field of view is being colonized to sell ads.
Like, when this little red dot comes out in your notifications, it grows and expands, and to your mind, it's huge.
So I started to think of ways to put a little dirt, or change the lenses of my glasses, and came up with another project.
Now, keep in mind this is conceptual.
It's not a real product.
It's a web browser plug-in that could help us to notice the things that we would usually ignore.
Like the helmet, the plug-in reshapes reality, but this time, directly into the digital media itself.
It shouts out the hidden filtered voices.
What you should be noticing now will be bigger and vibrant, like here, this story about gender bias emerging from the sea of cats.
(Laughter) The plug-in could dilute the things that are being amplified by an algorithm.
Like, here in this comment section, there are lots of people shouting about the same opinions.
The plug-in makes their comments super small.
(Laughter) So now the amount of pixel presence they have on the screen is proportional to the actual value they are contributing to the conversation.
(Laughter) (Applause) The plug-in also shows the real estate value of our visual field and how much of our perception is being commoditized.
Different from ad blockers, for every ad you see on the web page, it shows the amount of money you should be earning.
(Laughter) We are living in a battlefield between reality and commercial distributed reality, so the next version of the plug-in could strike away that commercial reality and show you things as they really are.
(Laughter) (Applause) Well, you can imagine how many directions this could really go.
Believe me, I know the risks are high if this were to become a real product.
And I created this with good intentions to train our perception and eliminate biases.
But the same approach could be used with bad intentions, like forcing citizens to install a plug-in like that to control the public narrative.
It's challenging to make it fair and personal without it just becoming another layer of mediation.
So what does all this mean for us?
Even though technology is creating this isolation, we could use it to make the world connected again by breaking the existing model and going beyond it.
By exploring how we interface with these technologies, we could step out of our habitual, almost machine-like behavior and finally find common ground between each other.
Technology is never neutral.
It provides a context and frames reality.
It's part of the problem and part of the solution.
We could use it to uncover our blind spots and retrain our perception and consequently, choose how we see each other.
Thank you.

I've been a journalist for more than 23 years, at the "Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," the "Pittsburgh Tribune Review" and most recently, "The Denver Post.
" (Applause) When I started at "The Denver Post" in 2003, it was among the country's 10 largest newspapers, with an impressive subscriber base and nearly 300 journalists.
At the time, I was in my 30s.
Any ambitious journalist that age aspires to work for one of the big national papers, like "The New York Times" or "The Wall Street Journal.
" But I was simply blown away by my first few weeks at "The Denver Post," and I thought, "This is going to be my paper.
I can make a career right here.
" Well, seven years passed, we were sold to a hedge fund, Alden Global Capital.
Within a few years -- (Laughs) (Laughter) Some of you know this story.
(Laughter) Within a few years, buyouts ordered by past and present owners would reduce the newsroom by nearly half.
And I understood.
The rule of thumb used to be that 80 percent of a newspaper's revenue came from pricy print ads and classifieds.
With emerging giants like Google and Facebook and Craigslist, those advertizing dollars were evaporating.
The entire industry was undergoing a massive shift from print to digital.
Alden's orders were to be digital first.
Take advantage of blogs, video and social media.
They said that one day, the money we made online would make up for the money we lost in print.
But that day never came.
In 2013, we won a Pulitzer Prize for covering the Aurora theater shooting.
Alden ordered that more journalists be cut.
Again, and again, and again, and again.
We were forced to say goodbye to talented, hardworking journalists we considered not just friends but family.
Those of us left behind were stretched impossibly thin, covering multiple beats and writing rushed articles.
Inside a windowless meeting room in March of 2018, we learned that 30 more would have to go.
This paper that once had 300 journalists would now have 70. And it didn't make sense.
Here, we'd won multiple Pulitzer Prizes.
We shifted our focus from print to digital, we hit ambitious targets and email from the brass talked up the Post's profit margins, which industry experts pegged at nearly 20 percent.
So if our company was so successful and so profitable, why was our newsroom getting so much smaller and smaller?
I knew that what was happening in Colorado was happening around the country.
Since 2004, nearly 1,800 newsrooms have closed.
You've heard of food deserts.
These are news deserts.
More and more newsrooms are being sold off to companies like Alden.
Harvest what you can, throw away what's left.
And I kind of get that.
For one thing, the local news has been in decline for so long that many of you may not even remember what it's like to have a great local paper.
Well, I'm not here to be romantic or nostalgic.
I'm here to warn you that when local news dies, so does our democracy.
Seeing, knowing, understanding -- this is how good decisions are made.
Listening in to state house and senate hearings.
Those important but, let's face it, sometimes devastatingly boring committee hearings.
Even better, researchers have found that reading a local paper can mobilize 13 percent of nonvoters to vote.
(Applause) That's the number that can change the outcome of many elections.
Voters become more partisan.
I don't think this is what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they talked about free and fair elections.
When they're being watched, politicians have less power, police do right by the public, even massive corporations are on their best behavior.
At the time, I was in my 30s.
" But I was simply blown away by my first few weeks at "The Denver Post," and I thought, "This is going to be my paper.
" Well, seven years passed, we were sold to a hedge fund, Alden Global Capital.
Within a few years -- (Laughs) (Laughter) Some of you know this story.
The entire industry was undergoing a massive shift from print to digital.
So if our company was so successful and so profitable, why was our newsroom getting so much smaller and smaller?
I knew that what was happening in Colorado was happening around the country.
Since 2004, nearly 1,800 newsrooms have closed.
You've heard of food deserts.
These are news deserts.
They are communities, often entire counties, with little to zero news coverage whatsoever.
Making matters worse, many papers have become ghost ships, pretending to sail with a newsroom but really just wrapping ads around filler copy.
More and more newsrooms are being sold off to companies like Alden.
And in that meeting, their intentions couldn't have been clearer.
Harvest what you can, throw away what's left.
So, working in secret with a team of eight writers, we prepared a special Sunday Perspective section on the importance of local news.
(Laughter) The Denver rebellion launched like a missile, and went off like a hydrogen bomb.
[In An Extraordinary Act Of Defiance, Denver Post Urges Its Owner To Sell The Paper] ['Denver Post' Editorial Board Publicly Calls Out Paper's Owner] [On The Denver Post, vultures and superheroes] (Applause and cheers) Clearly, we weren't alone in our outrage.
But as expected, I was forced to resign.
(Laughter) And a year later, nothing's changed.
"The Denver Post" is but a few lone journalists doing their admirable best in this husk of a once-great paper.
Now, at least some of you are thinking to yourself, "So what?
" Right?
So what?
Let this dying industry die.
And I kind of get that.
For one thing, the local news has been in decline for so long that many of you may not even remember what it's like to have a great local paper.
Maybe you've seen "Spotlight" or "The Paper," movies that romanticize what journalism used to be.
Well, I'm not here to be romantic or nostalgic.
I'm here to warn you that when local news dies, so does our democracy.
And that should concern you -- (Applause and cheers) And that should concern you, regardless of whether you subscribe.
Here's why.
A democracy is a government of the people.
People are the ultimate source of power and authority.
A great local newsroom acts like a mirror.
Its journalists see the community and reflect it back.
That information is empowering.
Seeing, knowing, understanding -- this is how good decisions are made.
When you have a great local paper, you have journalists sitting in on every city council meeting.
Listening in to state house and senate hearings.
Those important but, let's face it, sometimes devastatingly boring committee hearings.
(Laughter) Journalists discover the flaws and ill-conceived measures and those bills fail, because the public was well-informed.
Readers go to the polls and they know the pros and cons behind every ballot measure, because journalists did the heavy lifting for them.
Even better, researchers have found that reading a local paper can mobilize 13 percent of nonvoters to vote.
Thirteen percent.
(Applause) That's the number that can change the outcome of many elections.
When you don't have a great local paper, voters are left stranded at the polls, confused, trying to make their best guess based on a paragraph of legalese.
Flawed measures pass.
Well-conceived but highly technical measures fail.
Voters become more partisan.
Recently in Colorado, our governor's race had more candidates than anyone can remember.
In years past, journalists would have thoroughly vetted, scrutinized, fact-checked, profiled, debated every contender in the local paper.
"The Denver Post" did its best.
But in the place of past levels of rigorous reporting and research, the public is increasingly left to interpret dog-and-pony-show stump speeches and clever campaign ads for themselves.
With advertizing costing what it does, electability comes down to money.
So by the end of the primaries, the only candidates left standing were the wealthiest and best-funded.
Many experienced and praise-worthy candidates never got oxygen, because when local news declines, even big-ticket races become pay-to-play.
Is it any surprise that our new governor was the candidate worth more than 300 million dollars?
Or that billionaire businessmen like Donald Trump and Howard Schultz can seize the political stage?
I don't think this is what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they talked about free and fair elections.
(Applause and cheers) Now this is exactly why we can't just rely on the big national papers, like "The Journal" and "The Times" and "The Post.
" Those are tremendous papers, and we need them now, my God, more than ever before.
But there is no world in which they could cover every election in every county in the country. No. The newsroom best equipped to cover your local election ought to be your local newsroom.
If you're lucky and still have one.
When election day is over, a great local paper is still there, waiting like a watchdog.
When they're being watched, politicians have less power, police do right by the public, even massive corporations are on their best behavior.
This is what happens when local newsrooms shutter and communities across the country go unwatched and unseen.
Until we recognize that the decline of local news has serious consequences for our society, this situation will not improve.
A properly staffed local newsroom isn't profitable, and in this age of Google and Facebook, it's not going to be.
If newspapers are vital to our democracy, then we should fund them like they're vital to our democracy.
(Applause and cheers) We cannot stand by and let our watchdogs be put down.
We can't let more communities vanish into darkness.
It is time to debate a public funding option before the fourth estate disappears, and with it, our grand democratic experiment.
We need much more than a rebellion.
It is time for a revolution.
Thank you.
(Applause and cheers)
Have you ever been robbed?
Or had something you value forcibly taken from you against your will?
It's violating. Feelings of fury, of assault and of helplessness. That's what corruption feels like.
Corruption is theft.
It is corrosive, it is criminal, it is toxic and it is predatory.
Now, I'm from Kenya, and in Kenya, corruption takes different forms.
I want to share the story of Karura Forest with you.
This is my hometown of Nairobi.
I love Nairobi.
It's beautiful.
But it is a city of paradoxes.
It is at once beautiful and challenging.
But at the heart of this beautiful city that I call home is Karura Forest, an oasis of green, expansive beauty that would be the envy of any city anywhere. We almost lost Karura Forest to corruption.
Word has reached my mother, Wangari Maathai, that Karura Forest is under attack.
There was a construction site coming up right in the middle of the forest.
Government officials had stolen the forest.
They had divided, sold and gifted hundreds of parcels of Karura to their friends and cronies.
Now in 1977, my mother founded the Green Belt Movement to plant trees across Kenya, restore green spaces and protect green spaces, much like Karura Forest.
She got together her friends and allies, and together, they created what became one of the most successful tree-planting campaigns in the world. It was therefore no surprise that when word got to her that Karura was under attack, they immediately sprang into action.
They battled police and hired goons to stop the theft of this forest.
But fortunately, there was an uprising of support from the clergy, politicians, students and the general public, all of whom came out to say no to corruption and greed.
And pretty soon, that support was too strong and intense for the authorities to subdue.
And Karura Forest was saved.
In the 2000s, I joined my mother in the Green Belt Movement and witnessed the growth of the movement's advocacy activities, its expansion beyond Kenya and an extremely important growing consensus around the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize that she received -- that the environment, democracy and peace were inextricably linked.
I also learned that what my mother had faced that many years ago trying to protect Karura Forest was not an isolated incident.
The corruption and greed that manifested itself then is alive and well today, from greedy politicians and public servants willing to loot public coffers at their expense.
Corruption is everywhere.
Now, corruption is devastating to any economy, democracy and the environment.
It robs citizens of vital social services and renders human life worthless.
In recent years, Kenya has been ranked amongst the top 10 most corrupt countries in the world.
Even more frustrating for me is that Kenya loses a third of her national budget to corruption each year.
That is six billion dollars.
It is totally unacceptable.
In a country where anti-corruption efforts have been frustrated and ignored and interfered with, we absolutely need new strategies for dealing with this vice.
We cannot complain forever.
We either decide that we're going to live with it or we are going to change it.
There's some good news.
Human beings are not born corrupt.
At some point, these behaviors are fostered by a culture that promotes individual gain over collective progress.
So if we're going to uproot corruption, we have got to start before it ever takes root. We have got to intervene early.
I don't know about your country, but where I come from, youth will lead us into the future.
In Kenya today, 80 percent of the population is under the age of 35. But by their own admission, they have conflicting values.
Fifty-eight percent of young people in Kenya recently told us they will do anything to make money.
An additional 45 percent said corruption is a legitimate tool for doing business.
Seventy-three percent said they would not be willing to stand up for what they believe in for fear of retribution.
Shifting cultures takes patience, persistence and commitment, and it is extremely slow and deep work.
But if we are going to shift a culture, we have got to get that work started.
And in the time since her passing, we have established a foundation in her name to do exactly that but to work with young people and children to begin to build character and personal leadership, to inspire purpose and integrity.
But fighting corruption is not as easy as saying corruption is bad. Now, here are three strategies that we are employing that we believe can be replicated in any school community.
First, we must understand the why: Why does corruption happen in the first place?
Do we call it for what it is -- theft -- or do we gloss over it with other words?
When young children are able to model what it looks and feels like to deal with corruption, they are likely, when faced with a dilemma in their future, to model what they've been taught. Second, we need to teach character explicitly.
Now, this may seem obvious, but a child who exhibits a growth mindset and a sense of self-control is self-confident. And a self-confident child is likely to stand up for what they believe.
We have got to believe in our capacity to bring about the future we want to see, each of us in our small way. Young people must believe that a new reality is possible.
Corruption, climate change, ecosystem collapse, biodiversity loss -- all these issues need leadership.
And in the words of Baba Dioum of Senegal, "In the final analysis, we will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand and we will understand only what we are taught.
" Thank you.
(Applause)
I love dumplings.
But I seldom have dumplings in a restaurant, because my mom's cooking is the best.
One day, I happened to take a bite of Dumpling Xi's dish. To my surprise, they had a flavor of going home.
Fresh, chewy and unexpected.
In addition to being a dumpling lover, I actually have a full-time job.
I am a management consultant, so naturally, I was keen to understand the reasons behind those delicious dumplings.
What I didn't expect is that this dumpling triggered my exploration of new ways of management in China.
A change that is deeply rooted in ancient Chinese philosophies.
But first, let's go back to the dumplings.
Gāo Défú founded Dumpling Xi 17 years ago.
Today, the company enjoys 500 stores with 8,000 employees.
But it wasn't always the case.
Three years ago, the demand for his dumplings was soaring due to consumers' craving for healthy food.
But the strong growth of online food delivery services had pulled the consumers away from store visits, causing a huge concern for Gāo.
If I were to advise Gāo back then, I would go directly with the classical approach, hiring venture managers, providing training on how to integrate online-offline sales, or having some high potentials fully dedicated to the new job, such as a Chief Digital Officer.
But Gāo did something totally different.
He invented a two-hat model.
Instead of recruiting new executives, he invited five successful regional heads to take on a second role at headquarters.
The catch was, they had to do it while still being the frontline managers.
Keep in mind that these people had no formal training or related experience in this field.
What they did have, though, was natural strengths and a growth mindset.
When Gāo first told me the idea, I said, "Are you sure?
I have seldom seen companies as large as yours having part-time senior executives.
" Gāo's team was also puzzled.
In the first three months, the sales fluctuated, some even dropped by 20 percent.
But Gāo didn't blink.
The regional heads had to learn new skills while still doing their job.
Things like what kinds of dumplings can be sold online, how to digitalize their supply chain.
After the transition period, something magical happened.
The sales came back.
One year later, the company began to launch its fresh and spicy dumplings online.
Two years later, more talents with start-up dreams were attracted.
More importantly, the company began to translate these individual new capabilities into company policies, and roll them out.
A true differentiator compared with his peers.
The nature of Gāo's approach, such as having tolerance for frontline managers to make mistakes, or having some new ideas not coming from the top, is not common in China.
Because they go against our traditions.
In the past 2,000 years, Confucianism has been dominant in China, which values seniority and authority.
For a nation, this is a time-tested formula to ensure order and harmony.
For a company, this ensures precise execution at a large scale.
But with business environments constantly changing, internet disrupting traditional industries, new millennials becoming a major workforce, new ways of management emerge.
I feel so lucky to study this in such a dynamic age, while at the same time to satisfy my stomach with delicious dumplings.
Gāo's two-hat approach is just one example.
Another example comes from Miranda Qu, the founder of Xiaohongshu.
Xiaohongshu is a thriving internet company with 300 million users.
It is an online community where young fans can get together to talk about their favorite soap opera, "Go Go Squid!
" Or buy the cool shoes that the lead actress wears in a running scene.
From the early days, Qu wanted the whole organization to be ready to spot things that need to change and challenge the authority.
But one day, she noticed her interns were calling senior staff "teachers.
" This may sound innocent, but it signaled a problem to Qu.
Because if the teacher phenomenon becomes a norm, it will encourage hierarchy and discourage ownership.
This is also something related to Confucian thinking.
In Chinese, we call it "benfen.
" "Ben" means me, myself.
"Fen" means the share of the job.
"I will just focus on my job and not cross any lines," which is totally the opposite to Qu's thinking.
So Qu created a unique initiative called "Signature Program.
" In the program, each employee chooses an avatar character that pops up alongside digital communication channels.
Some common ideas include Captain Hook, Harry Potter and many well-known characters in Chinese literature.
The way these characters interact proved to be the answer to Qu's problem.
Avatars from the same story would get together to talk about their favorite characters.
In the community called "Slam Dunk," people from different cities, different departments, different levels of the organization, they would talk about how these characters inspired them at work.
An employee with a signature called Coach Anzai was facing some difficulty in leading a very young team.
Other Dunk fans will share the best practices on how to motivate a diversified team and inspire them to work to their full potential.
The signature program plays a pivotal role in fostering a collaborative environment at Xiaohongshu.
Not only the teacher issue has disappeared, the company has been ranked as one of the most innovative Chinese companies by Forbes in the past two years.
Gāo's two-hat approach and Qu's signature program are just two examples of empowering the frontline staff.
But these methods may not always be right.
The company couldn't adopt such an approach for the whole organization, because, one, the company has 400,000 employees, and the line between innovative chaos and chaotic chaos is very thin.
Two, the company has five ecosystems and 10-plus sectors -- health care, insurance, real estate, smart city.
Very difficult to apply a bottom-up innovation to all.
But the company still needs to be innovating.
Ma Mingzhe, the founder, positions the headquarters as the steering wheel.
Steering innovations and new ideas, cascading them down to its subsidiaries.
One of the ideas that headquarters came up with is AI-enabled loss assessment.
For a not-so-complicated case, the car owner can take a picture of the damaged car, upload it online.
The insurance center can decide a claim amount right away by AI-enabled loss assessment.
Facial recognition, ID verification.
The car owner can get a payment in a few minutes, which could have taken a few days.
So, for companies that [find it] difficult to conduct grassroots innovation, a centralized approach is also an option.
The more I see these unconventional management mechanisms -- Gāo with two hats, Qu with the signature program and Ma with the steering wheel -- the more I ponder where do these mechanisms come from.
They're definitely not Confucian.
They are very similar to another Asian school of thought, Taoism.
Confucianism believes the way to achieve perfection is to organize and regulate things.
But Taoism believes in letting things work to their perfection naturally, to support their natural state and to let them transform spontaneously.
In other words, leaders should not impose their will.
Leaders should act by shaping the context rather than control.
Confucianism works best in winning a stable context, whereas Taoism, with its power to shape the context, is more effective in dealing with uncertainty.
A leader is best when people barely know he exists.
When work is done, people say, "We did it ourselves.
" Thank you.
(Applause)
So, when I was 14, my family was in the process of adopting my little brothers from Ethiopia. And one day my mom asked, "What day should we put for their birthday?
" "Uh, the day they were born, obviously?
" Ridiculous question. And then my mom said, "Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers have a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?
" Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it, except instead of trying to solve the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I try to solve this problem globally. So what do birth certificates have to do with international development?
But how are they going to uphold human rights and how do they know if anyone is being left behind if they do not know who they are or where they are in the first place?So what can countries do about this?
Now, there's no one-size-fits-all model, because every country context is unique.
In 1881, doctor William Halsted rushed to help his sister Minnie, who was hemorrhaging after childbirth.
He quickly inserted a needle into his arm, withdrew his own blood, and transferred it to her.
After a few uncertain minutes, she began to recover.
Halsted didn’t know how lucky they’d gotten.
His transfusion only worked because he and his sister happened to have the same blood type— something that isn’t guaranteed, even among close relatives.
Blood types hadn’t been discovered by Halsted’s time, though people had been experimenting with transfusions for centuries— mostly unsuccessfully.
In 1667, a French physician named Jean-Baptiste Denis became the first to try the technique on a human.
Denis transfused sheep’s blood into Antoine Mauroy, a man likely suffering from psychosis, in the hopes that it would reduce his symptoms.
Afterward, Mauroy was in good spirits.
But after a second transfusion, he developed a fever, severe pain in his lower back, intense burning in his arm, and he urinated a thick, black liquid.
Though nobody knew it at the time, these were the signs of a dangerous immune response unfolding inside his body.
This immune response starts with the production of proteins called antibodies, which distinguish the body’s own cells from intruders.
They do so by recognizing the foreign proteins, or antigens, embedded in an intruder’s cell membrane.
Antibodies latch onto the antigens, signaling other immune cells to attack and destroy the foreign cells.
The destroyed cells are flushed from the body in urine.
In extreme cases, the massive break down of cells causes clots in the bloodstream that disrupt the flow of blood to vital organs, overload the kidneys, and cause organ failure. Fortunately, Denis’s patient survived the transfusion.
But, after other cross-species transfusions proved fatal, the procedure was outlawed across Europe, falling out of favor for several centuries.
It wasn’t until 1901 that Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types, the crucial step in the success of human to human blood transfusions.
He noticed that when different types were mixed together, they formed clots.
This happens when antibodies latch on to cells with foreign antigens, causing blood cells to clump together.
But if the donor cells are the same blood type as the recipient’s cells, the donor cells won’t be flagged for destruction, and won’t form clumps.
By 1907, doctors were mixing together small amounts of blood before transfusing it.
If there were no clumps, the types were a match.
This enabled them to save thousands of lives, laying the foundation for modern transfusions.
Up to this point, all transfusions had occurred in real time, directly between two individuals.
That’s because blood begins to clot almost immediately after coming into contact with air— a defense mechanism to prevent excessive blood loss after injury.
In 1914, researchers discovered that the chemical sodium citrate stopped blood coagulating by removing the calcium necessary for clot formation.
Citrated blood could be stored for later use— the first step in making large scale blood transfusions possible.
In 1916, a pair of American scientists found an even more effective anticoagulant called heparin, which works by deactivating enzymes that enable clotting.
We still use heparin today.
At the same time, American and British researchers developed portable machines that could transport donor blood onto the battlefields of World War I.
Combined with the newly-discovered heparin, medics safely stored and preserved liters of blood, wheeling it directly onto the battlefield to transfuse wounded soldiers.
After the war, this crude portable box would become the inspiration for the modern-day blood bank, a fixture of hospitals around the world.
My name is Joel, and I'm a co-parent.
Baby daddy is also someone who is not married by law to the mother of said child.
Growing up, I thought "co-parent" was reserved primarily for white families that starred in Netflix prime-time dramas.
(Laughter) It still kind of does.
But it wasn't used to explain the role of a parent. Right?
Either you had kids or you didn't, and no one in my social circles or at our dinner table was having complex conversations about the role fathers played in that conversation, right?
A more balanced, open, loving approach to parenting was not something we were discussing within our social circles.
A majority of the time, the fathers I knew of growing up were barely present or just completely nonexistent.
"Co-parent" wasn't a term I heard or saw where I grew up, where I came from.
I come from the hood.
That hood would be Creston Avenue, 188th in the Bronx.
And for -- one person, that's what's up.
(Laughter) Appreciate that.
For a lot of us in that hood, there was only one person you could already turn to for food, shelter, warmth, love, discipline: our mothers.
My mother, who I playfully call "Linda T," was my first example of real love and what showing up as a healthy co-parent looked like.
She was a strong, determined single mother, a woman who would have benefited greatly from having a secure and stable partner as a co-parent.
So I vowed whenever I got married, my boo and I would be together forever.
You know?
(Laughs) We'd share the same bed and home, we'd sleep under the same covers, we'd argue at IKEA -- normal stuff.
(Laughter) My partner would feel seen and loved, and our children would grow up in a two-parent household.
However, things rarely ever end up how we plan them.
Our daughter Lilah has never known a household with both of her parents living together under one roof.
Her mother and I were never married.
We dated on and off for several months before we found out she was pregnant.
Up until then, my mother didn't even know she existed.
I was ashamed, I was embarrassed, and, at times, I was suicidal.
I was asking myself, what was I doing? Where was I going wrong?
I never wanted the stigma or label of what some identified as the stereotypical "black father.
(Applause) It would involve love in a nurturing and safe environment that would feed Lilah long after we both left this earth.
Fast-forward four years, and Lilah is now in pre-K.
She loves gummies, and she says things like, "My heart is filled with love.
" She's the most loving, compassionate, empathetic human being I know, and the reason I get to tell you all of this is because she's back in the Bronx with her mother.
You see, this is co-parenting, and in an ideal world, my mother would have had a co-parent, too.
She would have had support, someone to show up and give her a break, a time off.
In an ideal world, every parent is a co-parent.
In an ideal world, both parents share the weight of the work appropriately.
Lilah's mother and I have a schedule.
Some days, I leave work and pick Lilah up from school, some days I don't.
Lilah's mother gets to go rock climbing or study for the LSAT, and I get to stand in a room full of bold, dynamic and powerful women and talk about dad stuff.
(Applause) It is work, it is beautifully hard work dismantling the systems that would have us believe a woman's primary role is in the kitchen, tending to all things domestic, while the hapless dad fumbles all over himself whenever he has to spend a weekend alone with the kids.
It is work that needs to happen right now.
You see, far too often, what it seems like is when both parents are working, one parent is typically tasked with organizing the household and keeping the home running.
That person is typically a woman or someone who identifies as such.
Far too often, those who identify as mothers and as women have to sacrifice their dreams in order to appease the standard.
They have to sacrifice their dreams in order to ensure that motherhood takes precedence over all else.
(Applause) Co-parenting makes the space possible for everybody.
As a co-parent, the time I've gotten to share and spend with Lilah is time I appreciate, the time that has allowed me to be fully present for my child, removing the notion that the emotional labor required to raise a child is a woman's work.
As a co-parent, Lilah and I have built snowmen, we've played with acorns, we've rapped to the soundtrack of "Moana," I know you have, too.
(Laughter) She's sat with me while I've led workshops at Columbia University, when I talk about the intersections of poetry, hip-hop and theater.
We get to talk about her emotions and her feelings because we have exclusive time together, and that time is planned time, it's organized around not just my schedule but her mother's.
Both of us, as co-parents, have unique parenting styles.
And we may argue at times, but what we can always agree on is how to raise a human -- our human.
I will never fully understand or comprehend what it means to hold a child in my body for 10 months.
I will never be able to understand the trials and tribulations of breastfeeding, the work that it takes, the emotional, physical, psychological and emotional toll that carrying a human can have on the female body.
What co-parenting does is say, we can create balance, a more balanced home and work life for everyone involved.
Co-parenting says that while parenting may involve sacrifices, yes, the weight of that sacrifice is not solely resting on one parent alone.
No matter your relational dynamic, no matter how you identify as a human being -- he, she, they, ze -- co-parenting says we can create space and equity, better communication, empathy, I hear you, I see you, how can I show up for you in ways that benefits our family?
My goal: I want more fathers to embrace co-parenting as a model for a better tomorrow, a better today for ourselves, for our co-parenting partners, for our families, for our community.
I want more fathers talking about fatherhood openly, candidly, honestly, lovingly.
Right?
I want more people to recognize that black fathers in particular are more than the court system, more than child support and more than what the media might portray us to be.
(Applause) Our role as fathers, our role as parents, our value as parents is not dependent on the zeroes at the ends of our checks but the capacity within our hearts to show up for our families, for the people we love, for our little ones.
Being a father is not only a responsibility, it's an opportunity.
This is for Dwain, this is for Kareem "Buc" Drayton, this is for Biggs, this is for Boola, this is for Tyron, this is for all the black fathers who are showing up on a day-to-day basis.
This is for Charles Lorenzo Daniels, my father, who didn't have the language or the tools to show up in the ways that he wanted to.
Thank you. My name is Joel.
Hi Bria, hi West. (In Yoruba) Amen.
(Applause)
Four years ago, a teenage girl changed my life in one conversation.
She was 13 years old, she was a friend's little cousin and she casually told me that she had met the man she was going to marry.
So I said, "OK, tell me about him.
" And she told me that his name was Harry Styles.
(Laughter) So I laughed a little, like you, and then she said, "I know you don't think I'm serious, but I'm actually going to be with him.
Because I love him so much that I would slit someone's throat to be with him. " (Laughter) And that was the moment that I became obsessed with fangirls.
I didn't know it then, but that moment would transform the course of my life and go on to change everything that I thought I knew about being an adult, being a woman and being truly happy.
But before we get started, what is a fangirl, and what is a Harry Styles?
Well, according to the dictionary, the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a fangirl is a "girl or woman who is an extremely or overly enthusiastic fan of someone or something.
" Technically, you can have fangirls of anything, but my specific interest was in fangirls of boy bands.
Because of their somewhat lethal reputation.
I remember, my dad had told me this story of some Beatles fans in the '60s, who apparently had torn a parked BMW to literal pieces, because the band had supposedly just been sat in it.
In the '60s, the Beatles were the biggest boy band on the planet, but when I met this girl in 2015, the biggest boy band on the planet was none other than One Direction.
And Harry Styles was a member of One Direction. Harry Styles was reputed for his compassionate demeanor and perfect hair.
I learn this when I read thousands of tweets about him.
I learn that he is a sweet cupcake.
I learn that he is a perfect angel.
I learn that one time, he vomited on the side of a freeway in California and that within two hours, fans had turned the site of the vomit into a sacred shrine.
(Laughter) I scroll through -- (Laughter) I scroll through fan-made paintings of Harry, baby photos of him, paintings of baby photos of him.
I watch videos that show me how to make DIY love totems for Harry -- for example, a lampshade covered in photos of his face, or a key ring that states the exact time of his birth.
I read hours of fan fiction, and I fall down this specific rabbit hole of stories that actually place me as a protagonist inside of various imagined romances with him. So in one, I tell him that I'm pregnant with his child.
In another, we meet in hospital where we're both fighting cancer, and in another, we fall so deeply in love that we become fugitives who kill people.
(Laughter) But then . . . something unthinkable happens.
One Direction, the biggest boy band on the planet, loses a member. Zayn Malik quits the band, and the internet explodes with feels.
I read tweets as these girls describe the physical pain of this loss, how they can't eat or sleep or walk.
I read them describe how much Zayn had meant to them.
And I watch videos of 10-year-old girls crying.
But, like, really crying.
And then I watch as people repost these videos but with new titles that contain words like "crazy" and "creepy" and "insane.
" And suddenly, my YouTube sidebar contains "Compilation: Fans react to Zayn leaving. Psycho alert! " Then I watch as mainstream news outlets cover the story.
I read them describe these "young banshees.
" I read one journalist say, "It's a commonly known fact since the age of the Beatles that there is nothing scarier in this world than a group of excited teenage girls. " (Laughter) And then I ask myself a question I've never considered in my life.
Why is it that the image of young girls screaming their lungs out with excitement for a pop star is considered crazy, psycho, scary, a bit much?
But the image of young boys screaming their lungs out for a footballer is perfectly normal?
And as soon as I realized this double standard, I realized that all of my curiosity about fangirls had been sparked by exactly the same judgments.
I, too, had suspected that they were a bit crazy.
I'd looked at images of girls screaming for the Beatles, the Backstreet Boys, One Direction, and the word that had come to mind was not "excitement" but "hysteria. " And what I did not know was the history of that word.
That in the 19th century, hysteria was considered to be a legitimate female mental disorder that could be diagnosed by doctors if women displayed excessive emotion or difficult behavior.
The word "hysterical" comes from the Latin word "hystericus," meaning "of the womb," because it was thought that this condition was caused by a dysfunction of the uterus.
And so, a treatment for hysteria was a hysterectomy.
Which is what we still call a removal of the womb.
And at this point, I decide to redeclare my obsession.
Because I am no longer just obsessed with fangirls.
Now, I'm obsessed with the way that the world talks about fangirls and the way that the world looks at young, female enthusiasm.
Because, I want to know, if girls grow up in a world where words like "crazy" and "psycho" and "hysterical" are casually used to describe female enthusiasm, then how does that shape the way that those girls get to see themselves?
Separately, I become obsessed with female screams.
Not in a creepy way.
I'm talking about, like, those shrieks and squeals that fangirls let out at concerts.
I want to know why it is that some people instinctively flinch when I merely describe the sound, like it's painful just to think about it.
Then I meet Amy Hume.
She's a voice coach.
And she blows my mind.
Because she tells me that the female voice between the ages of 11 and 13 is one of the most interesting things to study.
Why?
Because there's this research by Carol Gilligan that says that is the age when girls begin to perform and alter their voices.
For example, adding breath for maturity, (Imitating vocal fry) or adding vocal fry for apathy.
(Laughter) But tell me, according to this research, when do you reckon boys begin to perform and alter their voices?
Now, I guessed 18, because "men mature later," right? Wrong. The answer was four years old.
Because that is when boys learn not to cry or squeal.
That those are not manly sounds.
And that's when I realized that a fangirl's shriek is therefore like a superpower.
(Laughter) Because it's this fearless and honest expression of pure celebration and joy, and it's a sound they have not forgotten how to make.
I actually reckon that fangirls have a second superpower, because they know how to do something that most of my adult friends have no idea how to do.
Fangirls know how to love something without apology or fear. My years of researching fangirls culminated in this determination to write something that celebrates and vindicates them.
So I decided to make this thriller comedy musical that sounds like a Beyoncé concert meets rave meets church.
I called it "Fangirls," and I designed it like a Trojan horse.
Because they annoy you?
Or because it isn't what the boys do?
" And as a former fangirl cynic, that is the question that I want to leave you all with.
Why should fangirls tone it down?
Because they're crazy?
Or because our definition of "reasonable" is based on what it is acceptable for men to do?
What if we rethink the judgments we've been conditioned to feel when we see young women screaming their lungs out with excitement?
What if we decided to rethink the words we use to describe that joy, and what if we didn't allow ourselves to diminish girls with words that undermine their intelligence, their interests and their capability?
Because, according to my research, they are capable of building a shrine to Harry Styles's vomit on the side of a freeway within two hours.
(Laughter) That takes some executive skills in logistics and communication.
(Laughter) If that isn't "capable," I don't know what is.
(Applause) I reckon, instead of judging fangirls, we can learn from them.
We can all die tomorrow, so why not love things while we're still breathing?
And with that, I'd like to ask you all to try something with me.
Can I get you all to stand up?
Stand up if you can, stand up.
Alright, so here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to count to three and when I finish, I'm going to ask every single one of you to let out your very best fangirl scream.
(Laughter) Yeah?
Here is why I am asking you to do this. Because if all five-or-so thousand of you do this and really commit, we all get our first chance to hear that sound and to decide that it is not a crazy sound.
It is a hopeful sound.
So shall we do this?
I said, shall we do this?
(Audience: Yes!
) Alright.
OK, I am going to cheat and I'm not going to go full volume, because I'm miked and we don't want to hear that.
But it means you all have to go 110 percent.
You ready?
Take a deep breath with me.
Think of someone you love, let's go, one, two, three.
(Audience screams) (Laughter and applause) You all just sounded stunning and as sane and as intelligent and as dignified as when you walked in this room.
(Laughter) Thank you.
(Applause)
Lord Shiva— primordial destroyer of evil, slayer of demons, protector, and omniscient observer of the universe— was testing his wife’s patience.
Historically, the union between Shiva and Parvati was a glorious one.
They maintained the equilibrium between thought and action on which the well-being of the world depended.
Without Parvati as the agent of energy, growth, and transformation on Earth, Shiva would become a detached observer, and the world would remain static.
But together, the two formed a divine union known as Ardhanarishvara–– a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection to all living things.
For these reasons, Parvati was worshipped far and wide as the mother of the natural world–– and the essential counterpart to Shiva’s powers of raw creation.
While Parvati sustained daily life with care and control, Shiva had begun to belittle his wife’s essential work— and insisted on quarreling about their roles in the universe.
He believed that Brahma, the Creator of the world, had conceived the material plane purely for his own fancy.
And therefore, all material things were merely distractions called māyā— nothing but a cosmic illusion.
For millennia Parvati had merely smiled knowingly as Shiva dismissed the things she nurtured.
But upon His latest rebuke, she knew she had to prove the importance of her work once and for all.
She took flight from the world, withdrawing her half of the cosmic energy that kept the Earth turning.
At her disappearance, a sudden, terrifying and all-encompassing scarcity enveloped the world in eerie silence. Without Parvati, the land became dry and barren.
Rivers shrank and crops shriveled in the fields.
Hunger descended on humanity.
Parents struggled to console their starving children while their own stomachs rumbled.
With nothing to eat, people no longer gathered over heaped bowls of rice, but withdrew and shrank from the darkening world.
To His shock and awe, Shiva also felt the profound emptiness left by his wife’s absence.
Despite His supreme power, He too realized that He was not immune to the need for sustenance, and His yearning felt bottomless and unbearable.
As Shiva despaired over the desolate Earth, He came to realize that the material world could not be so easily dismissed.
At her husband’s epiphany, the compassionate Parvati could no longer stand by and watch her devotees wasting away.
To walk among them and restore their health, she took the form of a new avatar, carrying a golden bowl of porridge and armed with a jewel-encrusted ladle.
As word of this hopeful figure spread, she was worshipped as Annapurna, the Goddess of food.
With the arrival of Annapurna, the world blossomed anew.
People rejoiced at fertility and food, and communed together to give thanks.
Some believe that Annapurna first appeared in the sacred city of Kashi, or the Place of Freedom, on the banks of the Ganges— where she opened a kitchen to fill the bellies of the people until they could eat no more.
But it was not only mere mortals who were served at her feast.
Humbled at the scenes of earthly pleasure blooming all around him, Lord Shiva himself approached the goddess with an empty bowl and begged for food and forgiveness.
For this reason, the supreme deity is sometimes portrayed as a poor beggar at the mercy of Annapurna; holding her golden bowl in her left hand, while the right forms the abhaya mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance.
With these symbols, this powerful avatar makes it clear that the material world is anything but an illusion.
Rather, it is a cycle of life that must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths and rumbling bellies, to the equilibrium of the Earth.
In the mid-19th century, suspension bridges were collapsing all across Europe.
Their industrial cables frayed during turbulent weather and snapped under the weight of their decks.
So when a German-American engineer named John Roebling proposed building the largest and most expensive suspension bridge ever conceived over New York’s East River, city officials were understandably skeptical.
But Manhattan was increasingly overcrowded, and commuters from Brooklyn clogged the river.
In February of 1867, the government approved Roebling’s proposal.
To avoid the failures of European bridges, Roebling designed a hybrid bridge model.
From suspension bridges, he incorporated large cables supported by central pillars and anchored at each bank.
This design was ideal for supporting long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables.
But Roebling’s model also drew from cable-stayed bridges.
These shorter structures held up their decks with diagonal cables that ran directly to support towers.
By adding these additional cables, Roebling improved the bridge’s stability, while also reducing the weight on its anchor cables.
Similar designs had been used for some other bridges but the scope of Roebling’s plan here dwarfed them all.
His new bridge’s deck spanned over 480 meters— 1.5 times longer than any previously built suspension bridge.
Since standard hemp rope would tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his proposal called for over 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables.
To support all this weight, the towers would need to stand over 90 meters above sea level— making them the tallest structures in the Western Hemisphere.
Roebling was confident his design would work, but while surveying the site in 1869, an incoming boat crushed his foot against the dock.
Within a month, tetanus had claimed his life.
Fortunately, John Roebling's son, Washington, was also a trained engineer and took over his father’s role.
The following year, construction on the tower foundations finally began.
This first step in construction was also the most challenging.
Building on the rocky river bed involved the use of a largely untested technology: pneumatic caissons.
Workers lowered these airtight wooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes pumped pressurized air in and water out.
Once established, air locks allowed workers to enter the chamber and excavate the river bottom.
They placed layers of stone on top of the caisson as they dug.
When it finally hit the bedrock, they filled it with concrete, becoming the tower’s permanent foundation.
Working conditions in these caissons were dismal and dangerous.
Lit only by candles and gas lamps, the chambers caught fire several times, forcing them to be evacuated and flooded.
Even more dangerous was a mysterious ailment called "the bends.
" Today, we understand this as decompression sickness, but at the time, it appeared to be an unexplainable pain or dizziness that killed several workmen.
In 1872, it nearly claimed the life of the chief engineer.
Washington survived, but was left paralyzed and bedridden.
Yet once again, the Roeblings proved indomitable.
Washington’s wife Emily not only carried communications between her husband and the engineers, but soon took over day-to-day project management.
Unfortunately, the bridge’s troubles were far from over.
By 1877, construction was over budget and behind schedule.
Worse still, it turned out the bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them faulty wires.
This would have been a fatal flaw if not for the abundant failsafes in John Roebling’s design.
After reinforcing the cables with additional wires, they suspended the deck piece by piece.
It took 14 years, the modern equivalent of over 400 million dollars, and the life’s work of three different Roeblings, but when the Brooklyn Bridge finally opened on May 24, 1883, its splendor was undeniable.
Today, the Brooklyn Bridge still stands atop its antique caissons, supporting the gothic towers and intersecting cables that frame a gateway to New York City.
After all, this is basic supply and demand economics.
If, in any market, you dramatically increase supply, you should expect prices, profitability and growth to go down for existing players.
But in my personal experience, I've also seen the other side of the story.
Where online marketplaces, like Gojek in Indonesia or Jumia in Africa, have helped their business ecosystems and the communities around them.
The positive side I have seen demonstrated itself in a woman, a taxi driver in Egypt, that now had the opportunity to work without the harassment she faced in the taxi business.
It demonstrated itself through a village in Kenya that got an economic boost, because the nearby beautiful but completely unknown lake is now becoming a national ecotourism spot.
Online marketplaces will continue to grow.
And they will transform the way we shop, the way we travel and the way we transact with each other. So we really need to understand where is the truth between those two stories.
Should we expect more of the bright side or more of the dark and worrying side?
And is there a way to get the first without getting the second?
I believe there is.
As a strategy consultant, I study businesses for a living. And as a mathematician at heart, I couldn't live with something and its opposite being equally true. So, I went back to fundamentals, and I asked the question: What do online marketplaces really do?
What do they do?
Well, at their core, they're doing something very simple.
They match sellers and buyers. That's it.
For drivers and passengers, you get Uber, Grab in Southeast Asia or DiDi in China.
For matching merchants and consumers, you get Amazon, Alibaba or Jumia in Africa.
And by doing so, they can find better matches, do it faster and ultimately, unlock more value for everyone.
In fact, online marketplaces' core benefit is that they get us more from the same amount of effort.
By design, they create more value for the economy.
Now, we need to figure out who gets this additional value.
You can give it to the drivers -- more passengers, more income.
You can give it to consumers, if you reduce prices.
Or you can decide that the platform gets to keep all of it.
What usually happens is that all three of them would somehow split it.
But what about the rest of us?
We can also be impacted without being on either sides of this business. If my neighbor decides to rent his apartment on Airbnb, and we have more people coming in and out of the building, more noise than usual, then I'm getting an unpleasant side effect of this productivity magic.
This is what economists would call a "negative externality.
" The negative externality of Uber cars becoming more productive is taxi drivers seeing the value of their licenses drop by as much as 30 percent in New York, for example.
This is the dark side.
And this is what sparks street demonstrations and sometimes, sometimes, even violence.
I profoundly believe this is avoidable.
And it became clearer to me the more I have spent time in emerging markets.
In fact, during my time in Singapore, I spent half of any given week traveling in the region, between Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and I became a user -- actually, more of a fan -- of online marketplaces that were not that well-known back then.
But some of them made interesting strategic trade-offs that dramatically reduced their side effects, their externalities.
Take Gojek, for example.
They're basically Uber for motor bikes.
They are one of the most liked online marketplaces in Indonesia, and this has a lot to do with the role they chose to play.
Instead of picking a fight with every other transportation option out there, they choose to gradually integrate them within their own platform, so that without leaving the Gojek app, you can check the public transportation schedule and choose to take a bus for a long distance.
Then, maybe, a motorbike or a traditional taxi that you can order and pay for from within the same app.
If you look at Gojek today, nine out of 10 previous motor taxi drivers believe their quality of life has improved after joining the platform. And nine out of 10 consumers -- nine out of 10 -- believe that Gojek has a positive impact on society in general.
Now, this level of trust is what allowed Gojek to grow into what is today a super online marketplace for everything from food to grocery even massages and laundry pickups.
It all came from a deliberate trade-off to be an orchestrator of a bigger ecosystem where others also have their role to play, instead of a single winner, a hero, that takes for himself what would, at the end, be a smaller pie.
Another interesting example is Jumia.
Jumia is the equivalent of Amazon in Africa.
But they don't generate the same level of fear in the small-business community.
And one of the reasons for that is because they have decided to actively invest in African entrepreneurs, to grow them into the digital age.
We have studied online marketplaces in Africa last year.
And during that study, we have met one of Jumia's merchants.
His name is Jomo.
He was fired from his job in 2014, and at that time, he decided he wanted to become his own boss.
He wanted to be independent.
He also wanted to never be fired again.
So at that time, Jomo had no clue what a business is.
So he needed to go through a series of trainings to learn how to select products, how to price them and how to promote them online. Today, Jomo has a 10-employee online business.
And as of a few months ago, he just opened his very first brick-and-mortar shop in the suburbs of Nairobi.
Now, through its university, Jumia has the potential of helping a huge number of Jomos.
And we have estimated that together with other online marketplaces on the continent, they can generate three million additional jobs by 2025. And they would do that either directly, or through their impact on the wider community.
And sometimes, taking that wider impact into consideration or forgetting about it can make or break a platform.
To illustrate that, let's go back to Singapore.
So, when we decided with my wife to leave the country last year, Uber decided to do the same. At the same time, again, we started to see that pattern, but maybe it's a coincidence.
In reality, Uber lost the ride-hailing battle to a Malaysian-born start-up called Grab.
Now, interestingly, my wife didn't have the same level of concerns with Grab, because when Grab started, it had a different name.
It was called MyTeksi, and as the name suggests, it started as a platform for taxis. So when Grab started expanding the driver pool beyond taxis, it was seen as gradual and reasonable. They were also very careful while doing so.
They thought of what kind of social safety net they should bring to all drivers.
So they put in place special insurance packages and even financial education programs.
Now, compare that with what happened in London, in New York, in Paris, where taxi drivers didn't feel that the platforms understood they had to pay 200,000 euros for their license -- and mostly in loans.
When you don't take that kind of social environmental information into account, you get strong reactions.
I'm not trying to argue that the trade-offs by either Grab or Jumia or Gojek are risk-free.
Jumia is one of only three unicorns in the whole of Africa.
And Grab, well, they pushed out Uber out of the whole region of Southeast Asia.
And I also think these trade-offs have nothing specific to emerging markets. Amazon or Uber or others can learn from them and adapt them to their own realities.
In the long run, this doesn't need to be a zero-sum game.
In the long run -- and this is maybe the Asian side of me speaking -- it pays to be patient.
It pays to reconsider your goal and your priorities in the light of a much bigger equation that includes you and your users, of course, but also it includes regulators, policymakers, your communities.
And I would argue, above all, it includes the very businesses you are meant to disrupt.
Thank you.
(Applause)
But it took over a year to plan and execute, and it required the help of so many people, like the lobster boat captain, who helped transport all of the materials to the island.
And the volunteers, who helped carry thousands of pounds of wood and steel to the top of the hill through waist-high shrubs.
And in the end, "FOREVER" only lasted for three weeks.
(Laughter) So if you're wondering why I did it at all, as I often did during that process, it might help for you to know a little bit more about me and my upbringing.
I grew up in an evangelical Christian family. And although I'm an atheist today, I've realized that my religious upbringing has played a really important role in shaping the person that I've become.
In 1986, when I was five years old, my parents became missionaries to South Africa.
And that was during the last few years of the apartheid, so we lived in an all-white neighborhood, and I attended an all-white public school, while my parents helped found a multiracial church in downtown Cape Town.
Because I was so young, it was impossible for me to understand the magnitude of what was happening in South Africa at that time.
I witnessed the racism and oppression of people of color I knew and loved on a daily basis, but because of my own skin color, there was no way I could fully comprehend it.
But I had the privilege to experience, firsthand, one of the most influential social movements of the 20th century.
And the thing that left a long-lasting impression on me was how the people I met in South Africa could envision a better future for themselves and their country.
A future they really believed was possible.
And then they worked together, relentlessly, for decades, until they achieved that extraordinary historic change.
I was there to see Nelson Mandela released from prison, and I watched an entire country begin a major transformation.
And that transformed me as a person.
It instilled in me a sense of wonder and optimism and possibility that permeates everything I create.
I make sculptures like "FOREVER" as a way of giving physical, tangible forms to language and time.
Those powerful but invisible forces that shape the way we perceive and experience our realities.
And in doing so, I try to give other people the opportunity to reflect on their own perception of reality and inspire them to wonder and imagine what else might be possible.
I often use signs to do this, because of how simply and effectively they're able to grab our attention and communicate information.
They often point out things we would otherwise overlook, like this sign on the side of the highway in Texas. [TEMPTATIONS] They can often signify things that we can't see at all, like the distance to our destination.
A city in the US that contains so much history, the birthplace of our constitution.
But imagine you're walking down the street in an area that's undergoing a huge transformation due to gentrification. And as you walk down that street, you notice something flashing up above you. So you look up and you see this.
A flashing neon sign that says "All the light you see is from the past," and then "All you see is past," before turning off completely for a brief moment.
It asks you to stop and notice the history embedded in everything that you see.
And it reminds you that because light takes time to travel across space, even from just across the street or across the room, everything you're seeing in the present moment is technically an image of the past.
Signs influence the way we all navigate the world, which means they have the ability to create a collective experience or understanding.
My time in South Africa taught me that when people are able to find common ground and work together towards a mutual goal, powerful things can happen and so much more becomes possible.
And I want to create more opportunities for people to find that kind of common ground.
I want people to feel the power of collaboration, sometimes quite literally.
I put two sensors on a platform far enough apart so that one person can't make it work on their own.
But when two or more people work together to complete that electrical circuit, the inflatable comes to life. And it begins to fill with air, and the longer people hold hands, the larger it becomes, expanding into the words "You are magic.
" (Music, birds chirping) I always love to see how each group of people finds a different way to bridge that physical and metaphorical divide.
But as soon as they release their hands and break that connection, the words immediately begin to slouch and fall over and eventually return to a lifeless pile of fabric on the ground.
(Applause) At this moment in time, I think we could all agree that the future feels pretty bleak and uncertain.
But maybe the hope for a brighter, more sustainable, more equitable future depends first on our ability to imagine it.
But after we imagine it, we actually have to believe it's possible.
And then we have to find common ground with people we would maybe otherwise disagree with and work together towards that mutual goal.
And if we do that, I believe we have the capacity for magic.
So if you can humor me for one more minute, I'm going to ask everyone in this theater to hold hands.
When was the last time you held hands with a stranger?
(Laughter) And if you feel comfortable, go ahead and make that metaphorical gesture of reaching across the aisle.
And after you've held hands with people on either side of you, if you feel comfortable, please close your eyes.
Now take a minute to imagine what you want, what you want the future to look like.
And give yourself permission to be at least a little bit idealistic.
What do you want to see change or happen in your own life as an individual?
What do you want to see change or happen for everyone, for the planet? Can you picture it?
And can you start to see how, if we all worked together, it might actually be possible?
Now open your eyes, and let's make it real.
Thank you. (Applause)
So when was the last time that you wrote a handwritten note?
I have to admit that it's a lot of fun when people ask me what I do for my job, because I tell them I literally rub things together.
This sounds ridiculous, just rubbing things together.
But it has a technical name: tribology.
T-r-i-b-o-l-o-g-y, from the ancient Greek word "tribos," which means "to rub. " It's a funny-sounding word you've probably never heard before, but I promise you, discovering it changes your experience with the physical world.
Tribology has given me amazing projects.
I've worked on materials that fly, and I've worked on dog food -- a combination that doesn't sound like one person has any business doing in the span of just a couple years, until you start to view the world through a tribological lens.
And I think you'll be surprised at how significant a little bit of tribology can be in alleviating some very large problems.
Tribology is the study of friction, wear and lubrication.
You have all experienced all three of these things.
Remember the last time you tried to move a heavy object across the floor, and you could just feel something resisting you?
That would be friction.
Friction is the force that opposes motion.
Wear is the loss or transfer of material. It's the reason you have to replace your favorite shoes, because eventually the soles disappear.
Lubricants are used to reduce friction and wear.
They loosen up those stubborn rusted bolts that just otherwise will not budge.
But tribology is also defined as the science of interacting surfaces in relative motion.
So, interacting surfaces in relative motion: there are a lot of those in the world.
As you're sitting there right now, are you wiggling your foot at all or maybe shifting around in your seat?
Because guess what? Tribology is happening.
Even the smallest shift in your seat involves two surfaces moving relative to each other.
And your tribological interaction for the shift will be different than the person next to you.
This is because the clothes you're wearing change the friction between you and the seat.
If you're wearing silk, it's a little easier to squirm around in the seat than if you're wearing wool.
That's because the friction is lower for silk.
If you're moving your ankle or wiggling your ankle at all, did it make a popping sound?
You've had that, right?
You get up, you move around, and some joint cracks or pops.
Thank you for that sound, tribology.
That sound can come from the fluid that lubricates your joints just moving around.
You're essentially releasing gas bubbles in that fluid.
That sound can also come from the tendons simply moving over each other.
Pretty common in the ankle, so any of my fellow foot-wigglers out there may suddenly find themselves curious about the tribology of tendons.
But how does one become a tribologist like me?
It starts when you're a kid, of course.
I was a ballerina growing up.
I reached the level where I was dancing on my toes, or "en pointe. " Now, when you're dancing en pointe, you're wearing those amazing shoes, but they can be slippery on the stage.
The last thing you want to do when you're trying to dance on your toes is to slip and fall.
So we had boxes of stuff called rosin.
We would step into the rosin, put a light coating on our shoes.
Rosin comes from tree sap and, in its powdered form, makes things less slippery.
You learned real fast as a dancer how much was the right amount to put on your shoes, because if you didn't put enough on, you were probably going to slip due to the low friction between your shoe and the stage.
Best case scenario, you're the clumsy ballerina on stage, but the worst case scenario would be an injury.
Already, I was optimizing and manipulating friction.
You see, I was destined to be a tribologist.
(Laughter) But you were also a junior tribologist.
When you used crayons or colored pencils, you knew that the harder you pressed, the darker the color.
You also knew this meant you were going to have to sharpen that crayon or colored pencil more frequently, because it was wearing down faster.
Now let's talk about those enticing shiny waxed floors that you just had to slide across.
You knew if you put on a pair of socks, you were going to get a really good slide across that floor.
Good luck trying to do that barefoot.
Master manipulators of friction. All kids are tribologists.
What about us as adults?
At some point today, you brushed your teeth.
I hope.
(Laughter) This is tribology in action.
The toothpaste and toothbrush are working to remove or wear the plaque from your teeth.
For the record, my dad is a dentist.
Never thought my career was going to circle back to the family business.
But one day, we found ourselves speaking the same language when I was tasked with developing a test to investigate plaque removal.
Sounded simple enough, until I started to look at it as a tribologist, and then it became incredibly complex.
You have hard materials -- those would be your teeth -- soft materials like your gums, the toothpaste, the toothbrush. There's lubrication -- the form of saliva and water -- the dynamics of the person doing the brushing and more.
I promise if we put diamonds in your toothpaste, you're going to remove that plaque.
So there's a fine balance to be had between wearing the plaque away and not damaging your teeth and gums.
We're brushing our teeth because we ate.
Seems simple enough. But it's another field of tribology, and it's not so simple.
I think you can all recall a moment where you tried something new and you just found yourself going, "Well, it tastes alright.
I really don't like that texture.
" Tribologists are looking at lubricity, the coefficient of friction, as ways to connect mouth feel and texture to what you're experiencing, so that if we're changing the formulations of what we're eating and drinking so the sugar content or fat content are different, how does that change mouth feel?
This is what tribologists are looking to solve.
Animals as adults commonly get periodontal disease, so we really should be brushing their teeth, and more pet owners are starting to do this.
If you have a dog, you may have observed that you give a dog a treat, and it magically seems to disappear after just one bite.
So the added challenge here is: How do you remove plaque when you have one bite?
Let me give you one more example.
No matter where you are right now, you got to this location somehow.
You regularly check the treads on those tires.
Tribology is the study of wear and friction, and with tires, friction can be the difference between a safe arrival and a car accident.
This is because the friction between your tires and the road will influence your acceleration, your deceleration and your stopping distance.
As a driver, you instinctively already know how important friction is, because you know that when the roads are wet, they're more dangerous because they're slippery.
This is because the water is reducing the friction between your tires and the road.
Something else to consider is that overcoming friction takes energy, so you're losing energy to friction.
Tribology is the study of friction, wear and lubrication.
Friction is the force that opposes motion.
But tribology is also defined as the science of interacting surfaces in relative motion.
You've had that, right?
Best case scenario, you're the clumsy ballerina on stage, but the worst case scenario would be an injury.
I promise if we put diamonds in your toothpaste, you're going to remove that plaque.
We're brushing our teeth because we ate.
Eating is another routine thing we all do.
Seems simple enough. But it's another field of tribology, and it's not so simple.
You have the food, which will break and wear while you're eating, and that food is interacting with your teeth, your tongue, your saliva, your throat.
And all of those interactions are going to influence your experience of eating.
I think you can all recall a moment where you tried something new and you just found yourself going, "Well, it tastes alright.
I really don't like that texture.
" Tribologists are looking at lubricity, the coefficient of friction, as ways to connect mouth feel and texture to what you're experiencing, so that if we're changing the formulations of what we're eating and drinking so the sugar content or fat content are different, how does that change mouth feel?
How do we quantify that?
This is what tribologists are looking to solve.
And while my colleagues were in one corner of this lab looking at the fat content of yogurt, I was in another corner studying dog food.
That lab smelled really good, by the way, let me tell you.
We all brush our teeth on a regular basis.
How many of us brush our pets' teeth?
Animals as adults commonly get periodontal disease, so we really should be brushing their teeth, and more pet owners are starting to do this.
I know my best friend is really great at brushing her cat's teeth, somehow. Good luck trying to do that with my cat.
So what pet food suppliers are trying to do is incorporate plaque removal in things like treats.
If you have a dog, you may have observed that you give a dog a treat, and it magically seems to disappear after just one bite.
So the added challenge here is: How do you remove plaque when you have one bite?
I developed a benchtop test to study this problem, and to do so, I had to mimic the oral system of dogs: their teeth, plaque, saliva.
And I used friction and wear measurements to study the effectiveness of that treat on removing plaque.
If you're sitting there right now thinking about the last time you didn't brush your dog's teeth, you're very welcome.
But what's the big deal with tribology?
Let me give you one more example.
No matter where you are right now, you got to this location somehow.
Maybe you walked or rode your bike, but for most people in this room, you probably came in a car.
Just think about all the tribological systems in a car.
You have your personal interactions with the car, the car's interactions with the road and everything under the hood and in the drivetrain.
Some routine maintenance is directly connected to tribology.
You know how many miles your tires are recommended for using before you replace them.
You regularly check the treads on those tires.
You're actively monitoring the wear of your tires.
Tribology is the study of wear and friction, and with tires, friction can be the difference between a safe arrival and a car accident.
This is because the friction between your tires and the road will influence your acceleration, your deceleration and your stopping distance.
As a driver, you instinctively already know how important friction is, because you know that when the roads are wet, they're more dangerous because they're slippery.
This is because the water is reducing the friction between your tires and the road.
You may recall that friction is the force that opposes motion, so water reducing that force means it's now easier for you to move, hence it's more slippery when the roads are wet.
Something else to consider is that overcoming friction takes energy, so you're losing energy to friction.
This is one way your tires can influence your fuel efficiency.
And, in fact, did you know that about one-third of the fuel that you put into your internal combustion engine vehicle will be spent overcoming friction? One-third. Tribology research has helped us reduce friction and therefore increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.
Holmberg and Erdemir have actually done some great studies showing the impact tribology research can have on reducing our energy consumption.
And they found that, looking over the span of 20 years, we had the opportunity to reduce the energy consumption of passenger vehicles up to 60 percent.
When you think about all the cars in the world, that's a lot of energy we can save.
It's part of the nearly nine percent of our current global energy consumption that the authors identified tribology can help us save.
That's a significant amount of energy.
So when you look at the numbers, tribology can do some amazing things.
My colleagues have identified up to 20 quads of energy we can save across the US alone.
To put this in perspective: one quad of energy is roughly equivalent to 180 million barrels of oil, and tribology can help us save 20 times that.
This is through new materials, new lubricants, novel component design, doing things like making wind turbines more efficient and reliable.
This happened just by putting 31 people in a room who viewed the world through a tribology lens.
Imagine the opportunities that will reveal themselves as more of us start to see tribology all around.
My favorite projects right now are in aerospace applications.
I love reducing wear and friction in these challenging environments.
I can make materials and parts that will reduce the friction in moving components and engines so that they have less force opposing their motion.
Less force to move means they require less power, so you can use a smaller actuator, which would weigh less, which saves fuel.
I can also help make parts that last longer through lower wear.
This will reduce material waste and also means we're manufacturing the parts less frequently, so we're saving energy in manufacturing.
I encourage you to start seeing tribology in the world around you and to think about how you would improve those interacting surfaces you experience.
Even the smallest improvements really add up.
Tribology may be a funny-sounding word, but it has a huge impact on our world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I danced with Bella for the first time as Bei Mir Bistu Shein filled the room.
And her blue eyes locked with mine.
We took turns singing and forgetting the words.
She led, I followed.
A waltz step here, a shimmy here.
(Rattle sound) (Laughter) Hands on our hearts, our foreheads touching, as we communicated through movement and music, making sense through nonsense.
Bella is 83 and lives with dementia.
The dance gives us a chance to find each other.
How did I learn to dance with dementia?
Because I'm not a dancer.
And I'm not a doctor.
But I've played one in the hospital.
(Laughs) I'm a clown doctor.
Or a medical clown.
My tools are whoopee cushions, shakers (Shaker rattles) and a red nose.
Now, at the same time, there are studies to support it, but right now, I'd like to take you behind the nose and go beyond the laughter and share a few things that I've seen skating through ICUs.
In my Heelys.
Size 11. Because I take medical clowning very, very seriously.
(Deflating sound) (Laughter) (Deflating sound) (Deflating sound) (Laughter) My mentor was conducting clown rounds in the hospital when he was approached by a nurse.
They needed to put a tube up the kid's nose.
Kid didn't want to do it, so rather than hold the kid down, they asked my colleague if he could help.
So the clown asked for a second tube and shoved it up his own nose. Kid of like this.
Oh, please don't do this at home.
(Laughter) Now, the kid saw this, grabbed his own tube and promptly stuck it up his own nose, kind of like this.
(Applause) The clowns, the nurse and the patient discovered a creative solution for their situation together.
And guess what, there's research to back this up.
Randomized controlled trials in Israel and Italy show that medical clowns can be as effective as tranquilizers with no side effects.
In 2004, I started conducting my own clown rounds at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.
My colleague and I were invited to accompany a young six-year-old with the most adorable southern accent, to accompany him while he got his chemotherapy port flushed, a very uncomfortable and regular procedure.
We joined him, his mom and the nurse in this tiny, closed curtain cubicle.
Every medical clown encounter begins by obtaining consent from the patient.
So we ask him if we can be there.
He says, "Sure.
" We're often the one element that a child could control while they're in the hospital.
So we start with a card trick, fan the deck so he can pick.
But as soon as the nurse approaches with the needle to flush the port, he starts screaming and cussing like no six-year-old I'd ever heard in my life.
So we say, "Hey, should we come back later?
" He stops, mouth open, eyes wet with tears, face flushed pink with anger, and he smiles, "Oh no, you're fine, I want you to be here. " OK. So we start playing a song, my colleague on recorder, me on whoopee cushion.
The nurse approaches with the needle, and it happens again, this torrent of four-letter words.
He went from playing and laughing to screaming and crying, back and forth until the procedure was complete.
For the first time, I experienced this odd duality of joy and suffering.
But not for the last time.
See, when we're there, we're not there merely to distract or make anyone feel better per se.
The medical clowns work moment by moment to create connections between the clowns, the nurse, the parent and the child.
This provides a source of power or control for the child while supporting the staff with their work.
I've spent over a decade bringing joy and delight to the bedsides of terminally ill children in the top hospitals in New York City.
And you know what I've learned?
Everyone's hurting.
Staff, family, patients.
The patient's in the hospital because they're hurting.
The family's hurting as they navigate uncertainty, grief and the financial burdens of care.
The staff is hurting, only it's more than burnout.
More and more health care workers are reporting feeling overworked and overextended.
Now, I'm not so naive as to suggest that the solution is to send in the clowns.
(Laughter) But what if?
What if the tools of medical clown arts practitioners from around the world permeated our entire health care system?
In 2018, at the Healthcare Clowning International Meeting, they represented over 150 programs in 50 different countries.
University of Haifa offers a formal undergraduate degree program in medical clowning.
It makes things better for the whole health care team.
One of my favorite games to play in the hospital is elevator music.
I love elevators, because they're a place where paths cross, different worlds meet.
It's intimate, uncomfortably quiet and just begging for a little playful disruption.
The doors close and "The Girl from Ipanema" starts playing on Hammond organ, because I keep a portable speaker hidden in my pocket.
So for those used to using the silent, sterile elevator, it's a moment of surprise.
Folks have permission to acknowledge or not this disruption.
The game grows with every stop, because as soon as the elevator stops, the music stops.
New passengers get on, and the current passengers get to witness the new passengers -- their surprise -- as they hear the elevator music for the first time.
You experience the shift of adults standing silently, strangers in an elevator, to attempting to suppress their mirth, to, "Is this a party or an elevator," filled with full-on laughter.
Research conducted in Brazil, Australia, Canada and Germany confirm that the artistic interventions of medical clowns improve the work environment for the staff, beyond the elevator, and support their work administering care.
Promising research in the US indicates that arts programing in the hospital can improve the work environment, leading to increased job satisfaction and better quality of care.
My work has taught me how to actually be present.
How to breathe in a room with a person in pain.
How to connect and build trust, no matter the age, ability or illness.
And how medical clowning is an excellent way of using the arts to put the care back in health care. Thanks. (Applause)
In 2013, a team of researchers held a math test.
The exam was administered to over 1,100 American adults, and designed, in part, to test their ability to evaluate sets of data.
Hidden among these math problems were two almost identical questions.
Both problems used the same difficult data set, and each had one objectively correct answer.
The first asked about the correlation between rashes and a new skin cream.
The second asked about the correlation between crime rates and gun control legislation.
Participants with strong math skills were much more likely to get the first question correct.
But despite being mathematically identical, the results for the second question looked totally different.
Here, math skills weren’t the best predictor of which participants answered correctly.
Instead, another variable the researchers had been tracking came into play: political identity.
Participants whose political beliefs aligned with a correct interpretation of the data were far more likely to answer the problem right.
Even the study’s top mathematicians were 45% more likely to get the second question wrong when the correct answer challenged their political beliefs.
What is it about politics that inspires this kind of illogical error?
Can someone’s political identity actually affect their ability to process information?
The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon that has become increasingly visible in public life: partisanship.
While it’s often invoked in the context of politics, partisanship is more broadly defined as a strong preference or bias towards any particular group or idea.
Our political, ethnic, religious, and national identities are all different forms of partisanship.
Of course, identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part of human life.
Our sense of self is defined not only by who we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to.
As a result, we’re strongly motivated to defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of self and our social communities.
But this becomes a problem when the group’s beliefs are at odds with reality.
Imagine watching your favorite sports team commit a serious foul.
You know that’s against the rules, but your fellow fans think it’s totally acceptable.
The tension between these two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to resolve this uncomfortable state of limbo.
You might start to blame the referee, complain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself there was no foul in the first place.
In a case like this, people are often more motivated to maintain a positive relationship with their group than perceive the world accurately.
This behavior is especially dangerous in politics.
On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows people to create a political identity and support policies they agree with.
But partisan-based cognitive dissonance can lead people to reject evidence that’s inconsistent with the party line or discredits party leaders.
And when entire groups of people revise the facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can lead to policies that aren’t grounded in truth or reason.
This problem isn’t new— political identities have been around for centuries.
But studies show that partisan polarization has increased dramatically in the last few decades.
One theory explaining this increase is the trend towards clustering geographically in like-minded communities.
Another is the growing tendency to rely on partisan news or social media bubbles.
These often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas from people with similar views.
Fortunately, cognitive scientists have uncovered some strategies for resisting this distortion filter.
One is to remember that you’re probably more biased than you think.
Warning people that they might have been presented with misinformation can also help.
And when you’re trying to persuade someone else, affirming their values and framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive.
We still have a long way to go before solving the problem of partisanship.
But hopefully, these tools can help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence-based decisions about our shared reality.
I'm a protein designer.
And I'd like to discuss a new type of medicine.
It's made from a molecule called a constrained peptide.
There are only a few constrained peptide drugs available today, but there are a lot that will hit the market in the coming decade.
Let's explore what these new medicines are made of, how they're different and what's causing this incoming tidal wave of new and exciting medicines.
Constrained peptides are very small proteins.
They've got extra chemical bonds that constrain the shape of the molecule, and this makes them incredibly stable as well as highly potent.
They're naturally occurring, our bodies actually produce a few of these that help us to combat bacterial, fungal and viral infections.
And animals like snakes and scorpions use constrained peptides in their venom.
Drugs that are made of protein are called biologic drugs.
So this includes constrained peptides, as well as medicines like insulin or antibody drugs like Humira or Enbrel.
And in general, biologics are great, because they avoid several ways that drugs can cause side effects.
First, protein.
It's a totally natural, nontoxic material in our bodies.
Our cells produce tens of thousands of different proteins, and basically, all of our food has protein in it.
And second, sometimes drugs interact with molecules in your body that you don't want them to.
Compared to small molecule drugs, and by this I mean regular drugs, like aspirin, biologics are quite large.
Molecules interact when they adopt shapes that fit together perfectly.
Much like a lock and key.
Well, a larger key has more grooves, so it's more likely to fit into a single lock.
But most biologics also have a flaw.
They're fragile.
So they're usually administered by injection, because our stomach acid would destroy the medicine if we tried to swallow it.
Constrained peptides are the opposite.
They're really durable, like regular drugs.
So it's possible to administer them using pills, inhalers, ointments.
This is what makes constrained peptides so desirable for drug development.
They combine some of the best features of small-molecule and biologic drugs into one.
But unfortunately, it's incredibly difficult to reengineer the constrained peptides that we find in nature to become new drugs.
So this is where I come in.
Creating a new drug is a lot like crafting a key to fit a particular lock.
We need to get the shape just right.
But if we change the shape of a constrained peptide by too much, those extra chemical bonds are unable to form and the whole molecule falls apart.
So we needed to figure out how to gain control over their shape.
I was part of a collaborative scientific effort that spanned a dozen institutions across three continents that came together and solved this problem.
We took a radically different approach from previous efforts.
Instead of making changes to the constrained peptides that we find in nature, we figured out how to build new ones totally from scratch.
To help us do this, we developed freely available open-source peptide-design software that anyone can use to do this, too.
To test our method out, we generated a series of constrained peptides that have a wide variety of different shapes.
Many of these had never been seen in nature before.
Then we went into the laboratory and produced these peptides.
Next, we determined their molecular structures, using experiments.
When we compared our designed models with the real molecular structures, we found that our software can position individual atoms with an accuracy that's at the limit of what's possible to measure.
Three years ago, this couldn't be done.
But today, we have the ability to create designer peptides with shapes that are custom-tailored for drug development.
So where is this technology taking us?
Well, recently, my colleagues and I designed constrained peptides that neutralize influenza virus, protect against botulism poisoning and block cancer cells from growing.
Some of these new drugs have been tested in preclinical trials with laboratory animals.
And so far, they're all safe and highly effective.
Constrained peptide design is a cutting-edge technology, and the drug development pipeline is slow and cautious.
So we're still three to five years out from human trials.
But during that time, more constrained peptide drugs are going to be entering the drug development pipeline.
And ultimately, I believe that designed peptide drugs are going to enable us all to break free from the constraints of our diseases.
Thank you. (Applause)
What is the most beautiful place you have ever been?
And when you were there, did you take a picture of it?
Here's a place that tops that list for me.
This is Mesa Arch in Canyonlands National Park in Utah at sunrise.
It's the traditional homeland of the Pueblo, Ute, Paiute and Navajo people, and when you are there, it is absolutely stunning.
The sunrise illuminates the bottom of the arch orange, and then behind it you see the buttes and clouds and cliffs.
But what you might not see from my photo here is the 30 people behind me who were also taking photos.
And these are just the committed people, the sunrise people, right?
So when you think about that, there must be hundreds if not thousands of photos of Mesa Arch taken every week.
I've been sharing my photography on Instagram for years, and it started to become really interesting and funny, even, just how many similar photos of the same places I started to see online.
And I was participating in it.
So this made me wonder: Why are we taking photos in the first place?
Sometimes, I visit a popular landmark -- this one is Horseshoe Bend in Arizona -- and I see all the people with their phones and cameras out who snap a photo, just to turn and get back in the car or walk back to the trailhead.
And sometimes it seems like we are missing the point of going to this place to experience it for ourselves or to see it with our own eyes.
When I'm behind the camera, I notice the smallest details: the layers of light in the mountains as the light fades at the end of the day; the shapes that nature so expertly makes, abstract and yet completely perfect.
I could go on and on here musing about the intricacies of this planet and the way that it makes me feel.
Photographing the beauty and complexity of this world for me is like making a portrait of someone that I love.
And when I make a photograph, I have to think about what I want it to say.
I have to ask myself what I want it to feel like.
When you're communicating through an image, every creative choice matters.
Sometimes, I plan to share my images, and other times, I take them just for myself.
They found that when we're behind the camera, when we're the ones taking the picture, we enjoy our experiences more, not less.
But it wasn't true all the time.
If the person took the photo solely with the intention of sharing it, there was no increase in enjoyment, because they didn't do it for themselves.
So this points to an important distinction: photography can enhance your experience if it's done intentionally.
The intention piece is what matters.
As a photographer, I've really had to check myself on this.
When does it help me to have my camera out, and when do I just need to put it away?
On a trip to Alaska, I had the opportunity to photograph Alaskan brown bears.
I was on a boat with four other photographers, and we were all having our minds blown at the same time in such close proximity to these animals.
It's an emotional experience.
Being eye to eye with these bears gave me a feeling of connection that transcends words, and having my camera with me in this case enhanced that.
We were all creating independently but also all completely in the moment, both with nature and with each other.
I so clearly remember capturing the water droplets and the motion as the bears swam and the cute cubs following their mothers.
That group and I will have that experience together and these images to look back on time and time again, and photography is what enabled us to share this in the first place.
Other times, I choose to leave the camera behind, and I think that choice ultimately improves both my experience and my work.
I recently flew to the South Pacific island of Tonga to swim with humpback whales.
I noticed myself feeling pressure and a certain obligation to take the camera with me, when sometimes I just wanted the pure experience itself.
And the experience is seriously amazing.
You're talking about being in the water with a curious baby animal the size of a station wagon while you are surrounded by particles that float around you like glitter, and the mom swims gracefully below you.
There were times, obviously, when I did take my camera with me, and those were really amazing to capture as well.
But the setup is pretty big. It's like this big box.
This is what it looks like.
And so this is between me and the whales, and at times that feels like a block between you and reality.
Is there a difference when it's just your phone?
Last year, I went to Uluru in Central Australia, which is this massive rock that towers over the desert.
This is sacred land to Anangu, who are the Aboriginal people from this area and the traditional owners of the land.
There are particular spots in Uluru that you cannot photograph professionally, because they are culturally sensitive, equivalent to sacred scripture to Anangu.
So because of this, most of my photographs are from either far away, like this one, or from specific angles in the park.
You could say that some of the most interesting and beautiful visuals in Uluru are located in these sensitive areas, but the request not to photograph them is an explicit and direct invitation to learn more about the land, its importance and its people.
Isn't that what we should be doing anyway?
So my visit to Uluru quickly became not about me but about connecting with the place.
Ironically and unsurprisingly, I have found that presence and connection also happens to make for more compelling images.
We can probably all point to social media as being a good place to share the images from our travels and from our lives.
We not only share pieces of the world that we have seen but also parts of our day-to-day experiences.
And if we're applying intentionality to the photos we take, then hopefully we're sharing intentionally too.
For me, allowing people to see pieces of my story and my perspective online has reminded me that I'm not alone.
It's helped me build support and community to do the same for others.
Let me be clear: I am not trying to discourage you from taking photos.
Even if thousands of people have been to whatever exact location and taken whatever exact photo, I encourage you to get out and create too.
The world needs every voice and perspective, and yours is included.
But what I'm trying to show you is that the phone or camera doesn't have to stay out all the time.
What I'm trying to encourage you to do is to put it away, just for a moment -- a moment for you.
So let's go back to Mesa Arch, the way that the rock glows orange and the lovely layers of blue in the background.
What if the next time you were somewhere amazing, you couldn't bring your camera or phone?
What if you were not allowed to take any pictures at all?
Would it feel like a limitation?
Or would it feel like a relief?
So what can we do?
Well, the next time you feel the impulse to take out your camera or phone, or, in my case, once you realize you have already pulled it out -- (Laughter) First: stop. Pause. Take a deep breath.
Look around.
What do you notice?
Are you experiencing this moment with someone else?
Remember that this moment only comes once.
Photography can be part of a beautiful experience.
Just don't let it be a block between you and reality.
Be intentional, and don't lose a beautiful, irreplaceable memory, because you were too focused on getting the shot.
When I first became a doctor in Benin City, Nigeria, some 30-odd years ago, I was drawn to help people live full lives.
But often, I found myself feeling impotent.
Here I was, a brand-new doctor with all these skills, but I couldn't cure my patients who had chronic diseases -- illnesses like heart disease, asthma, diabetes -- and needed more than just handing them a prescription or providing grief counseling in the office to get the job done.
Fast-forward 15 years later: I'm in Atlanta, Georgia; it's a different world, but it was déjà vu all over again.
As doctors, we see our patients who have chronic illnesses in an episodic way.
In between, the patients have to learn how to make a lot of decisions for themselves.
I'll give you examples.
If you have medications you're supposed to take every day, what do you do when you're sick?
Are you still supposed to take it?
How do you recognize a complication when it happens?
How do you recognize a side effect when it happens?
What do you do with it?
In addition to all of this, they're dealing with the inevitable loneliness, isolation and anxiety that people who have chronic illnesses deal with.
In the US alone, six in 10 adults have a chronic illness.
That's 125 million people.
A recent report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation showed that health habits account for 50 percent of the health outcomes that people experience, while medical care only accounts for 20 percent.
In fact, the Centers for Disease Control says that if we could eliminate smoking, physical inactivity and poor nutrition, that we can prevent 80 percent of heart disease, 80 percent of type 2 diabetes and 40 percent of cancer.
But we also know that changing health behaviors is very difficult.
So we asked the question: What if we could create a resource that could motivate people to change health behavior?
The truth is, there are a lot of these resources out there that help people acquire these so-called self-management skills.
But many a time, they're not easily accessible or relatable, particularly to individuals within minority and underserved communities, who face bias in addition to barriers like language and culture and inadequate health insurance coverage.
And so in the last 12 years, my colleagues and I at Morehouse School of Medicine have created a technology-based application to assist with chronic illness care.
It's freely available on the web and as an app.
And what we do is get people to track variables -- blood pressure, blood sugar -- and then report it back to them in a color-coded format.
So green would indicate a healthy range, and red would indicate a problem that needs something done about it.
We link these stats to a curriculum.
The curriculum helps the individual learn about their health condition, whatever the chronic illness is.
They also work with a health coach to learn self-management skills, skills that'll help them prevent complications of their illness.
In order for the coach to be successful, they have to be able to gain the trust of the individual that they're working with.
We tested this application in clinics, where the health coaches were medical assistants, and in a large urban church, where the health coaches were volunteers from the health ministry.
A year later, a third of the participants were able to acquire three new self-management skills and maintain them to the extent that it was able to improve their blood pressures, their blood sugar and their exercise.
Now, what was simple yet fascinating to us was that the group from the church did just as well or even better than the group that were under purely medical care.
And we wanted to learn why that was.
My team and I call this "culturally congruent coaching.
" To illustrate this concept of culturally congruent coaching, I want to tell you about one of our patients. I'll call her Ms. Bertha. So Ms.
Bertha is an 83-year-old lady with diabetes and hypertension.
She was assigned to Anne, her health coach in the church.
Anne also happened to be a family friend to Ms. Bertha for many years, and they were fellow congregants.
Anne observed after the first few visits that even though Ms. Bertha faithfully recorded her stats, they were all showing up as red.
So she probed a little deeper to try to understand what was going on with Ms. Bertha, and Ms. Bertha gave her the real-real.
(Laughter) She told her that there were times when her medications made her feel weird, and she wouldn't take them the way they were prescribed, because she thought it was due to the medicines but she didn't tell her doctor that.
She also skipped out on some doctor appointments for a variety of reasons, but one of them was she wasn't doing better and she didn't want to make her doctor mad, so she just didn't go.
So Anne talked to Ms. Bertha and asked her to bring her daughter in for the next visit, which she did.
And at that visit, Anne was able to print out a log of all these stats that Ms. Bertha had been collecting, gave them to her and encouraged them to go see the doctor together, which they did.
With that information, the doctor was able to make changes to Ms. Bertha's treatment.
Within three months, Ms. Bertha's numbers were all in the green.
No one was more excited or surprised than Ms. Bertha herself.
Now, Anne was successful as a health coach because she cared enough to go below the surface and probe Ms. Bertha's deep culture and was able to reach her at that level.
She knew how to listen, and she knew how to ask the right questions to get to what was needed.
We all have deep unconscious rules that drive the way we make our health decisions.
That's our culture.
The relationship and the conversation between Anne and Ms. Bertha illustrates what's possible when we have conversations with our patients, our friends and our neighbors on a deep cultural level.
And personally, I'm beyond excited to think that with this simple concept of culturally congruent coaching, we could change the lives of 125 million Americans and many others across the world that are living with chronic diseases.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Often when I'm out in public, a child will stare at me.
And if the child is particularly brave, they'll approach me and ask: "Are you a pirate?
(Laughter) All I need is an eye-patch and a parrot, and I'm basically there.
(Laughter) But I like being a pirate.
I find many advantages to having a disability, and I'm not just talking about the money I save on gloves . . . (Laughter) or the fantastically legitimate excuse for never having to master chopsticks.
(Laughter) I'm talking about real advantages I feel I've gained, having gone through physical adversity.
When I was 19, I contracted a disease that resulted in the loss of both my arms at the elbows, both my legs below the knee, and left enough scars on my face to elicit jealousy in Freddy Krueger.
(Laughter) Now, I may never be able to communicate in sign language, but my increased resilience and general ability to problem-solve has been heightened by being forced to think laterally to overcome problems that most people aren't faced with.
One of the first lessons that I learned immediately followed the painful and arduous task of learning how to walk again, but it went on to pay dividends for the rest of my life.
It happened when I attempted to step up a curb.
Now as rudimentary as this action sounds to most of you, stepping up a curb is somewhat of a challenge for those of us without ankle movement.
So I tried stepping up the curb the way I'd always known how, front on, for days on end, with no success, until it became obvious that the time and effort I was investing into this endeavor was clearly disproportionate to the benefit of its outcome.
(Laughter) So, I decided to inspect the problem from a different angle.
If I couldn't use an ankle joint to achieve the range of motion that I required to mount the curb, I would have to use a different joint, like my hip.
So I turned my body perpendicular to the curb and placed my foot up sideways, and I was able to step up immediately.
Within five minutes, no staircase was safe from my advances.
(Laughter) That very day, I climbed a staircase of three flights, which I was quite impressed with as well, except I realized that I didn't know how to get back down again.
(Laughter) That was a long weekend.
(Laughter) Now, in my past life as an able-bodied person, I'd been a guitarist.
I was alright as a player, but I'd never really taken it further.
I'd never really started a band or played live all that much.
Nonetheless, music was a great passion of mine, and when I lost my arms, the idea that it may no longer be a part of my life critically challenged my will to keep living.
However, the thought that emerged immediately after being discharged from hospital was: "If Ray Charles can play the piano while blind as a bat, let's get to work on a solution for this guitar problem.
" So, consulting with an engineer, I designed a slide system that would hook into my left hook, and I devised another pick-holder system that would clip into my right hook.
Now, if this worked, I would be able to play the guitar open tuned on my lap, like a slide.
So after weeks of testing and alterations, I finally had the accessories back to play the guitar again, and I was right back where I was before losing my hands -- being issued with noise complaints from my neighbors, obviously.
(Laughter) But this time, I took it further.
I started a band with my friends.
We wrote songs and recorded them.
Now while relearning every action that one has ever cultivated might seem like a significant undertaking -- and believe me, it very much was, in the short term -- it was nonetheless having a positive effect on the way that I approached everything else in my life.
Not only did it transform my ability to problem-solve, but I also felt I became more pragmatic, less sensitive to hindrances, in some cases, more patient, and magically transformed people's abilities to offer me their seats on public transport.
(Laughter) Trivial setbacks began to pale in comparison to challenges I'd previously overcome, and this allowed me to take a calm and measured approach to these challenges, keeping them in perspective and often even finding new and improved ways to overcome them.
The benefit of not dwelling on the negative and just getting on with the task at hand became self-evident.
It even encouraged me to pursue some more fulfilling career paths that may otherwise have been inadvisable.
And who would have thought that an appropriate job for me might involve the meticulous operation of electronic equipment to curate dance music to people in inaccessible places under the influence of alcohol.
(Laughter) Not I.
So in a competitive industry where DJs have been relentlessly honing their craft, desperate to attain gigs, sending demos to clubs, my best friend and I took a different approach, and we started our own club night, and we employed ourselves as the DJs.
(Laughter) Suddenly, we had a headline slot.
(Laughter) Now, when we started that club night, I could not DJ.
The first time I ever got behind the decks was on our opening night, in front of hundreds of people.
I'd only just learned where the play button was.
(Laughter) But, being previously faced with so many ultimatums, one's forced to be astute in adapting to new situations.
That club night went on to become the longest-running weekly club night in Sydney, and we as DJs went on to play Australia's biggest music festivals.
So eventually, I either learned quickly, or the standards of clubs have gone really downhill.
(Laughter) Coming close to death can be an educational experience.
It's certainly true that one's priorities receive somewhat of a realignment immediately afterwards.
And it's also true that some of those priorities are met with an increased sense of urgency.
But another, more salient realization that comes to light is the triviality of our own self-importance and self-consciousness.
To truly understand the extent to which your self-consciousness prohibits you from engaging in opportunities should lead everyone to take risks they otherwise wouldn't.
We're merely a blip on the time line of the universe, right?
Act accordingly.
Now the ideas that I'm presenting today were imbued upon me through some otherwise unfortunate circumstances, granted, but they're lying dormant in the lives of anyone who's willing to exploit them.
Adversity is good, and it has the potential to make you stronger.
And, at the very least, you can scare the hell out of kids if you look like a pirate. Thanks. (Applause and cheers)
So, I have a background in technology and magic.
And magicians are interesting.
Their illusions accomplish what technology cannot. But what happens when the technology of the day seems almost magical?
What happens when you can do this?
(Music) Now, 100 years ago, that would have been the magic of levitation.
Is it possible to create illusions in a world where technology makes anything possible?
Jump!
Now, if you know how the trick is done, where is the illusion?
But still, our imagination is more powerful than our reasoning, and it's easy to attribute personality to machines.
These are quadcopters.
But they are more than mechanical flying machines.
They analyze the environment around them and react to everything I do.
At once, algorithms allow these autonomous machines to fly in close formation, aware of each other and aware of me -- mathematics that can be mistaken for intelligence, and intelligence for personality.
Anthropomorphism: that's the illusion, an illusion created by technology and embroidered by our imagination to become an intelligent flying robot, a machine that appears to be alive.
(Music plays "Close Encounters of the Third Kind") (Quadcopters make tones) I think they say, "Hello.
" Hey guys!
Come on.
And time to land.
And that's it.
Thank you.
(Applause) OK, guys, time to go home.
Everybody in here.
Come on, everybody, quickly, quickly.
No pushing, everybody can fit.
There you go, a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right.
Come on, everybody, everybody, and . . . good job!
(Cheers) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
We've all heard about how the dinosaurs died.
The story I'm going to tell you happened over 200 million years before the dinosaurs went extinct.
This story starts at the very beginning, when dinosaurs were just getting their start.
One of the biggest mysteries in evolutionary biology is why dinosaurs were so successful.
What led to their global dominance for so many years?
When people think about why dinosaurs were so amazing, they usually think about the biggest or the smallest dinosaur, or who was the fastest, or who had the most feathers, the most ridiculous armor, spikes or teeth.
But perhaps the answer had to do with their internal anatomy -- a secret weapon, so to speak.
My colleagues and I, we think it was their lungs.
I am both a paleontologist and a comparative anatomist, and I am interested in understanding how the specialized dinosaur lung helped them take over the planet.
So we are going to jump back over 200 million years to the Triassic period.
The environment was extremely harsh, there were no flowering plants, so this means that there was no grass.
So imagine a landscape filled with all pine trees and ferns.
At the same time, there were small lizards, mammals, insects, and there were also carnivorous and herbivorous reptiles -- all competing for the same resources. Critical to this story is that oxygen levels have been estimated to have been as low as 15 percent, compared to today's 21 percent.
So it would have been crucial for dinosaurs to be able to breathe in this low-oxygen environment, not only to survive but to thrive and to diversify.
So, how do we know what dinosaur lungs were even like, since all that remains of a dinosaur generally is its fossilized skeleton?
The method that we use is called "extant phylogenetic bracketing.
So, because dinosaurs were competing with early mammals during this time period, it's important to understand the basic blueprint of the mammalian lung.
(Laughter) This story takes place inside of a chest cavity.
Think about how the spinal vertebral column is completely horizontal to the ground.
This is how the spinal vertebral column is going to be in all of the animals that we'll be talking about, whether they walked on two legs or four legs.
This is our thoracic ceiling.
This is where the top surface of the lungs comes into direct contact with the ribs and vertebrae.
This interface is where our story takes place.
On the outside, it's like a giant inflatable bag where all parts of the bag expand during inhalation and contract during exhalation.
It is then unidirectionally ventilated by a series of flexible, bag-like structures that branch off of the bronchial tree, beyond the lung itself, and these are called air sacs.
Also, in many species of birds, extensions arise from the lung and the air sacs, they invade the skeletal tissues -- usually the vertebrae, sometimes the ribs -- and they lock the respiratory system into place.
The immobility permits this because a thin barrier is a weak barrier, and the weak barrier would rupture if it was actively being ventilated like a mammalian lung.
The forked ribs and the vertebral pneumaticity together were creating an immobilized, rigid framework that locked the respiratory system into place that permitted the evolution of that superthin, superdelicate blood-gas barrier that we see today in modern birds.
What led to their global dominance for so many years?
My colleagues and I, we think it was their lungs.
So, how do we know what dinosaur lungs were even like, since all that remains of a dinosaur generally is its fossilized skeleton?
So we would look at the anatomy of birds, who are the direct descendants of dinosaurs, and we'd look at the anatomy of crocodilians, who are their closest living relatives, and then we would look at the anatomy of lizards and turtles, who we can think of like their cousins.
And then we apply these anatomical data to the fossil record, and then we can use that to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs. And in this specific instance, the skeleton of dinosaurs most closely resembles that of modern birds.
So, because dinosaurs were competing with early mammals during this time period, it's important to understand the basic blueprint of the mammalian lung.
Also, to reintroduce you to lungs in general, we will use my dog Mila of Troy, the face that launched a thousand treats, as our model.
(Laughter) This story takes place inside of a chest cavity.
So I want you to visualize the ribcage of a dog.
Think about how the spinal vertebral column is completely horizontal to the ground.
This is how the spinal vertebral column is going to be in all of the animals that we'll be talking about, whether they walked on two legs or four legs.
Now I want you to climb inside of the imaginary ribcage and look up.
This is our thoracic ceiling.
This is where the top surface of the lungs comes into direct contact with the ribs and vertebrae.
This interface is where our story takes place.
Now I want you to visualize the lungs of a dog.
On the outside, it's like a giant inflatable bag where all parts of the bag expand during inhalation and contract during exhalation.
Inside of the bag, there's a series of branching tubes, and these tubes are called the bronchial tree.
These tubes deliver the inhaled oxygen to, ultimately, the alveolus.
They cross over a thin membrane into the bloodstream by diffusion.
Now, this part is critical.
The entire mammalian lung is mobile.
That means it's moving during the entire respiratory process, so that thin membrane, the blood-gas barrier, cannot be too thin or it will break.
Now, remember the blood-gas barrier, because we will be returning to this.
So, you're still with me?
Because we're going to start birds and it gets crazy, so hold on to your butts.
(Laughter) The bird is completely different from the mammal.
And we are going to be using birds as our model to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs.
So in the bird, air passes through the lung, but the lung does not expand or contract.
The lung is immobilized, it has the texture of a dense sponge and it's inflexible and locked into place on the top and sides by the ribcage and on the bottom by a horizontal membrane.
It is then unidirectionally ventilated by a series of flexible, bag-like structures that branch off of the bronchial tree, beyond the lung itself, and these are called air sacs.
Now, this entire extremely delicate setup is locked into place by a series of forked ribs all along the thoracic ceiling.
Also, in many species of birds, extensions arise from the lung and the air sacs, they invade the skeletal tissues -- usually the vertebrae, sometimes the ribs -- and they lock the respiratory system into place.
And this is called "vertebral pneumaticity.
" The forked ribs and the vertebral pneumaticity are two clues that we can hunt for in the fossil record, because these two skeletal traits would indicate that regions of the respiratory system of dinosaurs are immobilized.
This anchoring of the respiratory system facilitated the evolution of the thinning of the blood-gas barrier, that thin membrane over which oxygen was diffusing into the bloodstream.
The immobility permits this because a thin barrier is a weak barrier, and the weak barrier would rupture if it was actively being ventilated like a mammalian lung.
So why do we care about this?
Why does this even matter?
Oxygen more easily diffuses across a thin membrane, and a thin membrane is one way of enhancing respiration under low-oxygen conditions -- low-oxygen conditions like that of the Triassic period.
So, if dinosaurs did indeed have this type of lung, they'd be better equipped to breathe than all other animals, including mammals.
So do you remember the extant phylogenetic bracket method where we take the anatomy of modern animals, and we apply that to the fossil record?
So, clue number one was the forked ribs of modern birds.
Well, we find that in pretty much the majority of dinosaurs.
So that means that the top surface of the lungs of dinosaurs would be locked into place, just like modern birds.
Clue number two is vertebral pneumaticity.
We find this in sauropod dinosaurs and theropod dinosaurs, which is the group that contains predatory dinosaurs and gave rise to modern birds.
And while we don't find evidence of fossilized lung tissue in dinosaurs, vertebral pneumaticity gives us evidence of what the lung was doing during the life of these animals.
Lung tissue or air sac tissue was invading the vertebrae, hollowing them out just like a modern bird, and locking regions of the respiratory system into place, immobilizing them.
The forked ribs and the vertebral pneumaticity together were creating an immobilized, rigid framework that locked the respiratory system into place that permitted the evolution of that superthin, superdelicate blood-gas barrier that we see today in modern birds.
Evidence of this straightjacketed lung in dinosaurs means that they had the capability to evolve a lung that would have been able to breathe under the hypoxic, or low-oxygen, atmosphere of the Triassic period.
This rigid skeletal setup in dinosaurs would have given them a significant adaptive advantage over other animals, particularly mammals, whose flexible lung couldn't have adapted to the hypoxic, or low-oxygen, atmosphere of the Triassic.
This anatomy may have been the secret weapon of dinosaurs that gave them that advantage over other animals.
And this gives us an excellent launchpad to start testing the hypotheses of dinosaurian diversification.
This is the story of the dinosaurs' beginning, and it's just the beginning of the story of our research into this subject.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, on April 23 of 2013, the Associated Press put out the following tweet on Twitter.
It said, "Breaking news: Two explosions at the White House and Barack Obama has been injured.
" This tweet was retweeted 4,000 times in less than five minutes, and it went viral thereafter.
Now, this tweet wasn't real news put out by the Associated Press.
In fact it was false news, or fake news, that was propagated by Syrian hackers that had infiltrated the Associated Press Twitter handle.
Their purpose was to disrupt society, but they disrupted much more.
Because automated trading algorithms immediately seized on the sentiment on this tweet, and began trading based on the potential that the president of the United States had been injured or killed in this explosion.
And as they started tweeting, they immediately sent the stock market crashing, wiping out 140 billion dollars in equity value in a single day.
Robert Mueller, special counsel prosecutor in the United States, issued indictments against three Russian companies and 13 Russian individuals on a conspiracy to defraud the United States by meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
And what this indictment tells as a story is the story of the Internet Research Agency, the shadowy arm of the Kremlin on social media.
During the presidential election alone, the Internet Agency's efforts reached 126 million people on Facebook in the United States, issued three million individual tweets and 43 hours' worth of YouTube content.
All of which was fake -- misinformation designed to sow discord in the US presidential election.
A recent study by Oxford University showed that in the recent Swedish elections, one third of all of the information spreading on social media about the election was fake or misinformation.
In addition, these types of social-media misinformation campaigns can spread what has been called "genocidal propaganda," for instance against the Rohingya in Burma, triggering mob killings in India.
We studied fake news and began studying it before it was a popular term.
And we recently published the largest-ever longitudinal study of the spread of fake news online on the cover of "Science" in March of this year.
We studied all of the verified true and false news stories that ever spread on Twitter, from its inception in 2006 to 2017. And when we studied this information, we studied verified news stories that were verified by six independent fact-checking organizations.
So we knew which stories were true and which stories were false.
We can measure their diffusion, the speed of their diffusion, the depth and breadth of their diffusion, how many people become entangled in this information cascade and so on.
And what we did in this paper was we compared the spread of true news to the spread of false news.
And here's what we found. We found that false news diffused further, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth in every category of information that we studied, sometimes by an order of magnitude.
And in fact, false political news was the most viral.
It diffused further, faster, deeper and more broadly than any other type of false news.
When we saw this, we were at once worried but also curious.
Why?
Why does false news travel so much further, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth?
The first hypothesis that we came up with was, "Well, maybe people who spread false news have more followers or follow more people, or tweet more often, or maybe they're more often 'verified' users of Twitter, with more credibility, or maybe they've been on Twitter longer.
" So we checked each one of these in turn.
And what we found was exactly the opposite.
False-news spreaders had fewer followers, followed fewer people, were less active, less often "verified" and had been on Twitter for a shorter period of time.
And yet, false news was 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than the truth, controlling for all of these and many other factors.
So we had to come up with other explanations.
And we devised what we called a "novelty hypothesis.
" So if you read the literature, it is well known that human attention is drawn to novelty, things that are new in the environment.
And if you read the sociology literature, you know that we like to share novel information.
It makes us seem like we have access to inside information, and we gain in status by spreading this kind of information.
So what we did was we measured the novelty of an incoming true or false tweet, compared to the corpus of what that individual had seen in the 60 days prior on Twitter.
But that wasn't enough, because we thought to ourselves, "Well, maybe false news is more novel in an information-theoretic sense, but maybe people don't perceive it as more novel.
" So to understand people's perceptions of false news, we looked at the information and the sentiment contained in the replies to true and false tweets.
And what we found was that across a bunch of different measures of sentiment -- surprise, disgust, fear, sadness, anticipation, joy and trust -- false news exhibited significantly more surprise and disgust in the replies to false tweets.
And true news exhibited significantly more anticipation, joy and trust in reply to true tweets.
The surprise corroborates our novelty hypothesis.
This is new and surprising, and so we're more likely to share it.
At the same time, there was congressional testimony in front of both houses of Congress in the United States, looking at the role of bots in the spread of misinformation.
So we looked at this too -- we used multiple sophisticated bot-detection algorithms to find the bots in our data and to pull them out.
So we pulled them out, we put them back in and we compared what happens to our measurement.
And what we found was that, yes indeed, bots were accelerating the spread of false news online, but they were accelerating the spread of true news at approximately the same rate.
Which means bots are not responsible for the differential diffusion of truth and falsity online.
We can't abdicate that responsibility, because we, humans, are responsible for that spread.
Now, everything that I have told you so far, unfortunately for all of us, is the good news.
The reason is because it's about to get a whole lot worse.
And two specific technologies are going to make it worse.
We are going to see the rise of a tremendous wave of synthetic media.
Fake video, fake audio that is very convincing to the human eye.
The first of these is known as "generative adversarial networks.
" This is a machine-learning model with two networks: a discriminator, whose job it is to determine whether something is true or false, and a generator, whose job it is to generate synthetic media.
" And in fact, it is the job of the generator to maximize the likelihood that it will fool the discriminator into thinking the synthetic video and audio that it is creating is actually true.
Imagine a machine in a hyperloop, trying to get better and better at fooling us.
The White House issued a false, doctored video of a journalist interacting with an intern who was trying to take his microphone.
And when videographers and stuntmen and women were interviewed about this type of technique, they said, "Yes, we use this in the movies all the time to make our punches and kicks look more choppy and more aggressive.
" They then put out this video and partly used it as justification to revoke Jim Acosta, the reporter's, press pass from the White House.
There are about five different paths that I can think of that we can follow to try and address some of these very difficult problems today.
Each one of them has promise, but each one of them has its own challenges.
The first one is labeling.
Think about it this way: when you go to the grocery store to buy food to consume, it's extensively labeled.
You know how many calories it has, how much fat it contains -- and yet when we consume information, we have no labels whatsoever.
Is the source credible?
That is a potential avenue, but it comes with its challenges.
Another potential avenue is incentives.
While we should consider things like regulating political speech, labeling the fact that it's political speech, making sure foreign actors can't fund political speech, it also has its own dangers.
We want them to open the kimono and show us exactly the inner workings of how Facebook is working.
It said, "Breaking news: Two explosions at the White House and Barack Obama has been injured.
Now, this tweet wasn't real news put out by the Associated Press.
In fact it was false news, or fake news, that was propagated by Syrian hackers that had infiltrated the Associated Press Twitter handle.
Their purpose was to disrupt society, but they disrupted much more.
And what this indictment tells as a story is the story of the Internet Research Agency, the shadowy arm of the Kremlin on social media.
So we knew which stories were true and which stories were false.
Why does false news travel so much further, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth?
And this will powered by two technologies.
So the synthetic generator generates synthetic video or audio, and the discriminator tries to tell, "Is this real or is this fake?
" And in fact, it is the job of the generator to maximize the likelihood that it will fool the discriminator into thinking the synthetic video and audio that it is creating is actually true.
Imagine a machine in a hyperloop, trying to get better and better at fooling us.
This, combined with the second technology, which is essentially the democratization of artificial intelligence to the people, the ability for anyone, without any background in artificial intelligence or machine learning, to deploy these kinds of algorithms to generate synthetic media makes it ultimately so much easier to create videos.
The White House issued a false, doctored video of a journalist interacting with an intern who was trying to take his microphone.
They removed frames from this video in order to make his actions seem more punchy.
And when videographers and stuntmen and women were interviewed about this type of technique, they said, "Yes, we use this in the movies all the time to make our punches and kicks look more choppy and more aggressive.
" They then put out this video and partly used it as justification to revoke Jim Acosta, the reporter's, press pass from the White House.
And CNN had to sue to have that press pass reinstated.
There are about five different paths that I can think of that we can follow to try and address some of these very difficult problems today.
Each one of them has promise, but each one of them has its own challenges.
The first one is labeling.
Think about it this way: when you go to the grocery store to buy food to consume, it's extensively labeled.
You know how many calories it has, how much fat it contains -- and yet when we consume information, we have no labels whatsoever.
What is contained in this information?
Is the source credible?
Where is this information gathered from?
We have none of that information when we are consuming information.
That is a potential avenue, but it comes with its challenges.
For instance, who gets to decide, in society, what's true and what's false?
Is it the governments?
Is it Facebook?
Is it an independent consortium of fact-checkers?
And who's checking the fact-checkers?
Another potential avenue is incentives.
We know that during the US presidential election there was a wave of misinformation that came from Macedonia that didn't have any political motive but instead had an economic motive.
And this economic motive existed, because false news travels so much farther, faster and more deeply than the truth, and you can earn advertising dollars as you garner eyeballs and attention with this type of information.
But if we can depress the spread of this information, perhaps it would reduce the economic incentive to produce it at all in the first place.
Third, we can think about regulation, and certainly, we should think about this option.
In the United States, currently, we are exploring what might happen if Facebook and others are regulated.
While we should consider things like regulating political speech, labeling the fact that it's political speech, making sure foreign actors can't fund political speech, it also has its own dangers.
For instance, Malaysia just instituted a six-year prison sentence for anyone found spreading misinformation.
And in authoritarian regimes, these kinds of policies can be used to suppress minority opinions and to continue to extend repression.
The fourth possible option is transparency.
We want to know how do Facebook's algorithms work. How does the data combine with the algorithms to produce the outcomes that we see?
We want them to open the kimono and show us exactly the inner workings of how Facebook is working.
And if we want to know social media's effect on society, we need scientists, researchers and others to have access to this kind of information.
But at the same time, we are asking Facebook to lock everything down, to keep all of the data secure.
So, Facebook and the other social media platforms are facing what I call a transparency paradox.
We are asking them, at the same time, to be open and transparent and, simultaneously secure.
This is a very difficult needle to thread, but they will need to thread this needle if we are to achieve the promise of social technologies while avoiding their peril.
The final thing that we could think about is algorithms and machine learning.
Technology devised to root out and understand fake news, how it spreads, and to try and dampen its flow.
Technology is not a solution for that.
Ethics and philosophy is a solution for that.
Nearly every theory of human decision making, human cooperation and human coordination has some sense of the truth at its core.
But with the rise of fake news, the rise of fake video, the rise of fake audio, we are teetering on the brink of the end of reality, where we cannot tell what is real from what is fake.
And that's potentially incredibly dangerous.
We have to be vigilant in defending the truth against misinformation.
With our technologies, with our policies and, perhaps most importantly, with our own individual responsibilities, decisions, behaviors and actions.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I am an ideas activist.
That means I fight for ideas I believe in to have their place in the sun, regardless of which side of the equator they were born.
As well I should.
I myself am from that part of the world often euphemistically referred to as either "the Global South" or "the developing world.
" But let's be blunt about it: when we say those words, what we really mean is the poor world -- those corners of the world with ready-made containers for the hand-me-down ideas of other places and other people.
But I'm here to depart a little bit from the script and to try and convince you that these places are actually alive and bubbling with ideas.
My real issue is: Where do I even start?
So maybe Egypt, Alexandria, where we meet Rizwan.
Counterfeiters making knockoff medicines.
Luckily for Rizwan, my team and I, working in partnership with the largest pharmaceutical company in Africa, have placed unique codes -- think of them like one-time passwords -- on each pack of the best-selling heart medicine in Egypt.
So when Rizwan buys heart medicine, he can key in these one-time passwords to a toll-free short code that we've set up on all the telecom companies in Egypt for free.
He gets a message -- call it the message of life -- which reassures him that this medicine is not one of the 12 percent of all medicines in Egypt that are counterfeits.
From the gorgeous banks of the Nile, we glide into the beautiful Rift Valley of Kenya.
In Narok Town, we meet Ole Lenku, salt-of-the-earth fellow.
When he walks into an agrodealer's shop, all he wants is certified and proper cabbage seeds that, if he were to plant them, will yield a harvest rich enough that he can pay for the school fees of his children.
Unfortunately, by the reckoning of most international organizations, 40 percent of all the seeds sold in Eastern and Southern Africa are of questionable quality, sometimes outrightly fake.
Finally, we alight in Ghana, my own home country, where another problem needs addressing -- the problem of under-vaccination or poor-quality vaccination.
These are some of the solutions at work saving lives, redeeming societies, in these parts of the world.
But I would remind you that there are powerful ideas behind them, and I'll recap a few.
Now, every time I go somewhere and I give this speech and I make these comments and I provide these examples, people say, "If these ideas are so damn brilliant, why aren't they everywhere?
" I want to assure you, the reason why you have not heard of these ideas is exactly the point I made in the beginning.
And that is that there are parts of the world whose good ideas simply don't scale because of the latitude on which they were born.
" What if, in response, I told you that actually, underlying each of these problems that I've described is a fundamental issue of the breakdown of trust in markets and institutions, and that there's nothing more global, more universal, closer to you and I than the problem of trust.
But I bet you don't know that a single investigation uncovered one million counterfeit incidents in the aeronautical supply chain in the US.
It's a global problem.
A decade, and costing a hundred times more.
(Applause) So we go back to the issue of ideas.
You say, "What?
So you need the best ideas to address them.
My real issue is: Where do I even start?
Finally, we alight in Ghana, my own home country, where another problem needs addressing -- the problem of under-vaccination or poor-quality vaccination.
You see, when you put some vaccines into the bloodstream of an infant, you are giving them a lifetime insurance against dangerous diseases that can cripple them or kill them.
Sometimes, this is for a lifetime.
The problem is that vaccines are delicate organisms really, and they need to be stored between two degrees and eight degrees.
And if you don't do that, they lose their potency, and they no longer confer the immunity the child deserves.
Working with computer vision scientists, we've converted simple markers on the vials of vaccines into what you might regard as crude thermometers.
These are some of the solutions at work saving lives, redeeming societies, in these parts of the world.
But I would remind you that there are powerful ideas behind them, and I'll recap a few.
One, that social trust is not the same as interpersonal trust.
Two, that the division between consumption and regulation in an increasingly interdependent world is no longer viable.
And three, that decentralized autonomy, regardless of what our blockchain enthusiasts in the West -- whom I respect a lot -- say, are not as important as reinforcing social accountability feedback loops.
These are some of the ideas.
Now, every time I go somewhere and I give this speech and I make these comments and I provide these examples, people say, "If these ideas are so damn brilliant, why aren't they everywhere?
I've never heard of them.
" I want to assure you, the reason why you have not heard of these ideas is exactly the point I made in the beginning.
And that is that there are parts of the world whose good ideas simply don't scale because of the latitude on which they were born.
I call that "mental latitude imperialism.
" (Laughter) That really is the reason.
But you may counter and say, "Well, maybe it's an important problem, but it's sort of an obscure problem in parts of the world.
Why do you want to globalize such problems?
I mean, they are better local.
" What if, in response, I told you that actually, underlying each of these problems that I've described is a fundamental issue of the breakdown of trust in markets and institutions, and that there's nothing more global, more universal, closer to you and I than the problem of trust.
For example, a quarter of all the seafood marketed in the US is falsely labeled.
So when you buy a tuna or salmon sandwich in Manhattan, you are eating something that could be banned for being toxic in Japan. Literally. Most of you have heard of a time when horsemeat was masquerading as beef in burger patties in Europe?
You have.
What you don't know is that a good chunk of these fake meat patties were also contaminated with cadmium, which can damage your kidneys.
This was Europe.
Many of you are aware of plane crashes and you worry about plane crashes, because every now and then, one of them intrudes into your consciousness.
But I bet you don't know that a single investigation uncovered one million counterfeit incidents in the aeronautical supply chain in the US.
So this is a global problem, full stop.
It's a global problem.
The only reason we are not addressing it with the urgency it deserves is that the best solutions, the most advanced solutions, the most progressive solutions, are, unfortunately, in parts of the world where solutions don't scale.
And that is why it is not surprising that attempts to create this same verification models for pharmaceuticals are now a decade behind in the USA and Europe, while it's already available in Nigeria.
A decade, and costing a hundred times more.
And that is why, when you walk into a Walgreens in New York, you cannot check the source of your medicine, but you can in Maiduguri in Northern Nigeria.
That is the reality.
(Applause) That is the reality.
(Applause) So we go back to the issue of ideas.
Remember, solutions are merely packaged ideas, so it is the ideas that are most important.
In a world where we marginalize the ideas of the Global South, we cannot create globally inclusive problem-solving models.
Now, you might say, "Well, that's bad, but in such a world where we have so many other problems, do we need another cause?
" I say yes, we need another cause.
Actually, that cause will surprise you: the cause of intellectual justice.
You say, "What?
Intellectual justice?
In a world of human rights abuses?
" And I explain this way: all the solutions to the other problems that affect us and confront us need solutions.
So you need the best ideas to address them.
And that is why today I ask you, can we all give it one time for intellectual justice?
(Applause)
Have you ever felt lonely?
The urge of wanting to connect with people, but you seem to have no one you really would want to contact?
Or, it's a Friday night and you want to be with others, but you have no energy to go out, so instead you sit at home all evening, watch Netflix and feel more alone than ever? You feel like a monster between humans that know how to function.
This is what loneliness felt like to me.
So I'm an artist, and I process my emotional world by sharing my feelings through my art.
If you share your feelings with someone, and they understand and share those feelings too, you create an emotional and deep connection.
This is why you can be surrounded by hundreds of people, jump from one candidate to the next, but still feel lonely.
It's because these deeper connections haven't been made.
I was an always-happy child.
I think we nearly have no single photo of me where I don't smile broadly or laugh or joke around.
And this went on until . . . well, it's still the case.
But I had many friend groups up until, as a young adult, I moved to another city for my first job as a comic artist.
And like so many young, thriving people all over the planet, I concentrated all my energy into my work life.
But, if you spend, like, 90 percent of your daily capacity trying to succeed at work, of course there is nothing left to take care of all the other important aspects in your life, like your human relationships.
Nourishing friendships as an adult is work.
You need to be consistent with connecting.
You need to be open, you need to be honest.
Isn't it?
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?
(Laughter) OK.
The turning point came when I fell into an emotionally abusive relationship just a few years ago.
He isolated me and left me feeling more alone than ever.
It was the lowest point in my life, but it was also my wake-up call, because it was the first time that I really felt loneliness.
Many artists put their feelings into their art.
There are endless books, movies, paintings, music, all filled with the real emotion of an artist.
So, as an artist myself, I did the same.
I shared my feelings.
Loneliness through social exclusion is very common.
In our game, the brother of Kay got bullied in his school, and he just wants to hide and fly away.
We also show loneliness through mental health issues, with the boyfriend of Kay, who suffers from depression and shows that sometimes it is most important to focus on your own well-being first.
The boyfriend also tends to camouflage his feelings, so he appears like a lone, shiny white wolf.
Like in real life, Self-Doubt is blocking the path, and it seems impossible to overcome it.
It's always something in the distance.
Look at what emotions you barely feel or maybe feel too much and move towards lowering those peaks.
Or, it's a Friday night and you want to be with others, but you have no energy to go out, so instead you sit at home all evening, watch Netflix and feel more alone than ever? You feel like a monster between humans that know how to function.
And this went on until . . . well, it's still the case.
I shared my feelings.
So, in our game -- we called it "Sea of Solitude" -- you are a person named Kay, who is suffering from such strong loneliness that her inner feelings -- the anger, the feeling of hopelessness, worthlessness -- turn to the outside, and she becomes a monster.
The game -- well, Kay -- is actually a representation of me and the path I went through to overcome my struggles.
The game plays, actually, in Kay's mind, so you walk through a world that is flooded by her tears, and the weather is changing by her mood, how her mood is changing.
And, well, the only thing Kay wears, the only thing, is her backpack.
It's the baggage we all carry throughout our life.
And Kay doesn't know how to cope with her emotions in the right way, so her backpack becomes bigger and bigger until it bursts, and she finally is forced to overcome her own struggles.
In our story, we present many different manifestations of loneliness.
Loneliness through social exclusion is very common.
In our game, the brother of Kay got bullied in his school, and he just wants to hide and fly away.
And we portray him as a huge bird monster surrounded by thick fog.
The player has to actually walk through his school and experience, really feel the harm, that the brother had been through, because for a long time, nobody really listens to him.
But the very moment friends and family start to listen, the first step towards overcoming this form of loneliness had been made.
We also show loneliness in relationships, like when parents just stay together for the sake of their kids but end up hurting the entire family.
We put the player literally in between the two parents while they are fighting, and you get hurt in the middle. They don't even see that their daughter, Kay, is right there until she breaks down.
We also show loneliness through mental health issues, with the boyfriend of Kay, who suffers from depression and shows that sometimes it is most important to focus on your own well-being first.
The boyfriend also tends to camouflage his feelings, so he appears like a lone, shiny white wolf.
But the moment he starts to interact with his girlfriend, Kay, the mask falls off, and we see the black dog beneath it: depression.
Sometimes we put on a smile instead of dealing with the issues at hand, and that can ultimately make it worse, affect the people around us and damage our relationships.
So Kay herself we portray as ripped apart into her basic emotions.
Some help you, some are trying to stop you. Self-Doubt is a huge creature, always telling Kay how worthless she is and that she should just give up.
Like in real life, Self-Doubt is blocking the path, and it seems impossible to overcome it.
Destroying the omnipresence of Self-Doubt is a slow process.
But in the game, you can slowly, like, shrink her, so she turns from self-doubt to actually healthy doubt, and you can finally trust her advice.
We also show Self-Destruction.
It's a huge monster always lurking nearby under the water's surface. Self-Destruction is actually the main antagonist of the game, and she is always trying to drown you in the ocean of tears.
But, when she actually drowns you, you wake up just a few moments [before], and you have a chance to progress again.
It's always something in the distance.
We portrayed Joy as a child version of Kay, with a yellow raincoat, so she is invulnerable to the ocean of tears.
But Joy can also turn into obsession and start to be actually harmful for Kay, like when she starts obsessing over her boyfriend.
Joy will not turn back to normal until Kay realizes that her happiness should not depend on anybody else but herself.
So our monsters appear huge and scary, but if you overcome your reluctance and approach them, you soon see that they are no monsters at all, but just fragile beings that are simply overwhelmed by what life throws at them.
All of those emotions, be it self-doubt or even self-destruction, don't completely vanish in our game.
The key message is to not only chase for joy or happiness but to embrace all your emotions and bring them into balance, being OK with sometimes not being OK.
Everyone has their own loneliness story to tell.
Being much more open with my emotions and concentrating much more on my private life, my friends, my family.
There’d been many attempts to right the tower during its 800 year history, but this team’s computer models revealed the urgency of their situation.
This long pause allowed the soil to settle, and when construction began again in 1272, the foundation was on slightly more stable footing.
By the time they completed the seventh floor and bell chamber, the angle of the tilt was 1.6 degrees.
For centuries, engineers tried numerous strategies to address the lean.
In 1838, they dug a walkway around the base to examine the sunken foundation.
But removing the supporting sand only worsened the tilt.
In 1935, the Italian Corps of Engineers injected mortar to strengthen the base.
However, the mortar wasn’t evenly distributed throughout the foundation, resulting in another sudden drop.
All these failed attempts, along with the ever-sinking foundation, moved the tower closer to its tipping point.
And without definitive knowledge of the soil composition, engineers couldn’t pinpoint the tower’s fatal angle or devise a way to stop its fall.
In the years following WWII, researchers developed tests to identify those missing variables.
And in the 1970’s, engineers calculated the curved tower’s center of gravity.
With this data and new computing technology, engineers could model how stiff the soil was, the tower’s trajectory, and the exact amount of excavation needed for the tower to remain standing.
In 1992, the team drilled diagonal tunnels to remove 38 cubic meters of soil from under the tower’s north end.
Then, they temporarily counterbalanced the structure with 600 tons of lead ingots before anchoring the base with steel cables.
More than six centuries after its construction, the tower was finally straightened… to a tilt of about four degrees.
No one wanted the tower to fall, but they also didn’t want to lose the landmark’s most famous feature.
Today the tower stands at 55– or 56– meters tall, and it should remain stable for at least 300 years as a monument to the beauty of imperfection.In 1990, the Italian government enlisted top engineers to stabilize Pisa’s famous Leaning Tower.
There’d been many attempts to right the tower during its 800 year history, but this team’s computer models revealed the urgency of their situation.
To understand their situation, it’s helpful to understand why the tower tilted in the first place.
In the 12th century, the wealthy maritime republic of Pisa set about turning its cathedral square into a magnificent landmark.
Workers embellished and enlarged the existing church, and added a massive domed baptistry to the plaza.
In 1173, construction began on a free-standing campanile, or bell tower.
The engineers and architects of the time were masters of their craft.
But for all their engineering knowledge, they knew far less about the ground they stood on.
Pisa’s name comes from a Greek word for “marshy land," which perfectly describes the clay, mud, and wet sand below the city’s surface.
Ancient Romans counteracted similar conditions with massive stone pillars called piles which rest on Earth’s stable bedrock.
However, the tower’s architects believed a three-meter foundation would suffice for their relatively short structure.
Unfortunately for them, less than five years later, the tower’s southern side was already underground.
Such a shifting foundation would normally have been a fatal flaw.
If workers added more weight, the pressure from upper stories would sink the structure and fatally increase the lean.
But construction halted at the fourth story for nearly a century as Pisa descended into prolonged warfare.
This long pause allowed the soil to settle, and when construction began again in 1272, the foundation was on slightly more stable footing.
Under the direction of architect Giovanni di Simone, workers compensated for the tower’s minor tilt by making the next few floors taller on the southern side.
But the weight of the extra masonry made that side sink even deeper.
By the time they completed the seventh floor and bell chamber, the angle of the tilt was 1.6 degrees.
For centuries, engineers tried numerous strategies to address the lean.
In 1838, they dug a walkway around the base to examine the sunken foundation.
But removing the supporting sand only worsened the tilt.
In 1935, the Italian Corps of Engineers injected mortar to strengthen the base.
However, the mortar wasn’t evenly distributed throughout the foundation, resulting in another sudden drop.
All these failed attempts, along with the ever-sinking foundation, moved the tower closer to its tipping point.

This is Sian Ka'an. Just south of Tulum on Mexico's Caribbean coast, it's a federally protected reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet.
Although I can never know where a product was dropped, I can, at times, based on the label, know where something was made. In red, you see all of the countries represented by their trash in Sian Ka'an.
And one of the ironies is that a lot of what I'm finding are products for cleaning and beautification, such as this item from the United States, which is actually made to protect your plastic, (Laughter) shampoo from South Korea, bleach from Costa Rica and a Norwegian toilet cleaner.
This guy is so cute.
(Laughter) (Laughter) And it's these fascinating objects, but also horrifying objects, each with their own history, that I use to make my ephemeral, environmental artworks.
I noticed that blue was the most prevalent color among the plastic. Purple is actually the most rare color.
It's kind of like gold to me.
I had no idea that almost 10 years later, almost a decade later, I'd still be working on it.
I'm collecting it and organizing it by color on the same beaches where I find it. This is my precious trash pile as seen in 2015 after putting on a first edition of the "Museo de la Basura," or "Museum of Garbage.
My key question at first, after starting the project, was, "What do I do with the garbage when I'm done?
And then finally, it dawned on me, after all of the effort by me and all of the people who have helped me collect and organize and clean this trash, that I should keep it.
And so, over the years, I've become a little obsessed with my trash collection.
(Laughter) And in the latest work, I've begun to break the two-dimensional plane of the photograph.
I'm really excited about this new work. I see these as living artworks that will morph and grow over time.
Although my greatest wish is that I run out of the raw material for this work, we're not there yet.
So in the next phase of the project, I plan on continuing the community work and making my own work at a much larger scale, because the problem is massive.
Eight million tons of plastic waste enter our oceans every year, destroying ecosystems.
Right now, as I speak, there's literally an oil spill of plastic happening.
I see this project as a plea for help and a call to action.
Thank you so much. (Applause)This is Sian Ka'an. Just south of Tulum on Mexico's Caribbean coast, it's a federally protected reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet.
Although I can never know where a product was dropped, I can, at times, based on the label, know where something was made. In red, you see all of the countries represented by their trash in Sian Ka'an.
Such as these Haitian butter containers in all shapes and sizes, Jamaican water bottles. Not surprisingly, a lot of the stuff is from neighboring Caribbean countries, but the stuff is from everywhere. Here's a sampling of international water bottles.
And one of the ironies is that a lot of what I'm finding are products for cleaning and beautification, such as this item from the United States, which is actually made to protect your plastic, (Laughter) shampoo from South Korea, bleach from Costa Rica and a Norwegian toilet cleaner.
This guy is so cute.
(Laughter) (Laughter) And it's these fascinating objects, but also horrifying objects, each with their own history, that I use to make my ephemeral, environmental artworks.
And it all started with this image in February of 2010, when I first visited Sian Ka'an.
I noticed that blue was the most prevalent color among the plastic. Purple is actually the most rare color.
It's kind of like gold to me.
So this turned out to be a sketch for a work that I completed three years later.
I had no idea that almost 10 years later, almost a decade later, I'd still be working on it.
But the problem persists.
So I'm going to show you some of the images from the series that I called "Washed Up: Transforming a Trashed Landscape.
" Please keep in mind that I do not paint the garbage.
I'm collecting it and organizing it by color on the same beaches where I find it. This is my precious trash pile as seen in 2015 after putting on a first edition of the "Museo de la Basura," or "Museum of Garbage.
" It's fully my intention to care for this garbage, to exalt it, put it on a pedestal and to curate it.
We have all seen devastating images of animals dying with plastic in their bellies. And it's so important for us to really see those and to take those in.
But it's by making aesthetic -- some might say beautiful -- arrangements out of the world's waste, that I'm trying to hook the viewer to draw in those that might be numb to the horrors of the world and give them a different way to understand what's happening.
Some have described the Great Pacific Garbage Patch as an island twice the size of Texas, but I've been told that it's hard to see because it's more like a smog.
So through my artwork, I attempt to depict the reality of what's happening with our environment and to make the invisible visible.
My key question at first, after starting the project, was, "What do I do with the garbage when I'm done?
" I was told by some that it could be damaged goods after traveling across the ocean and being exposed to the elements, that it could become degraded and potentially ruin a batch of recycling.
The landfill was not a happy resting place, either.
And then finally, it dawned on me, after all of the effort by me and all of the people who have helped me collect and organize and clean this trash, that I should keep it.
And so that's the plan, to use it and to reuse it endlessly to make more artwork and to engage communities in environmental art-making.
And so, over the years, I've become a little obsessed with my trash collection.
I pack it into suitcases and travel with it.
I take it on vacation with me.
(Laughter) And in the latest work, I've begun to break the two-dimensional plane of the photograph.
I'm really excited about this new work. I see these as living artworks that will morph and grow over time.
Although my greatest wish is that I run out of the raw material for this work, we're not there yet.
So in the next phase of the project, I plan on continuing the community work and making my own work at a much larger scale, because the problem is massive.
Eight million tons of plastic waste enter our oceans every year, destroying ecosystems.
Right now, as I speak, there's literally an oil spill of plastic happening.
I see this project as a plea for help and a call to action.
Thank you so much. (Applause)
So, in 2016, I was commissioned to produce a photo essay about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.
And that's been going on since 2014. And I accepted the commission with the idea that I would photograph three generations of women dealing with the crisis on a daily basis.
I was fortunate to meet two best friends, artists, activists and poets Amber Hasan and Shea Cobb, who took me around Flint.
As a school bus driver, Shea Cobb became the central figure of the photo essay, along with her mother, Ms. Renée, and her eight-year-old daughter, Zion.
I obsessively followed Shea's school bus routes.
And when Shea wasn't driving the bus, she would be watching over Zion, making sure she was studying.
I embedded myself in every intimate facet of Shea's life.
When Shea took me to Zion's school, and I saw the water fountains covered with signs that said, "Contaminated.
Do not drink," I couldn't pick up my camera to photograph it.
It rocked me to the core to see that in America, we can go from fountains that say "Whites" or "Blacks only," to today seeing fountains that say, "Contaminated water.
Do not drink.
" And somehow, that's acceptable?
The residents in Flint have been forced to drink with, cook with and bathe with bottled water, while paying the highest water bills in the country for water that is infected with deadly legionella bacteria.
It was natural for me to go to Flint, because industrial pollution, bacteria-contaminated water were all too familiar for me growing up in my hometown, Braddock, Pennsylvania, where my mother and I battled cancer and autoimmune disorders like lupus.
Our 14-year collaboration, "The Notion of Family," was created out of our struggle to survive environmental racism, healthcare inequity and chemical emissions that were being deregulated and released from the United States Steel Corporation, making Braddock the town with the highest asthma and infant mortality rates in the country.
From the Monongahela River to the Flint River, in the words of W. E. B. Du Bois, "The town, the whole valley, has turned its back upon the river.
It has used it as a sewer, as a drain, as a place for throwing their waste.
" General Motors has been cited for dumping chemicals in the Flint River for decades.
When my photo essay "Flint is Family" came out in August of 2016, it was released to remind America that although Flint was no longer headline news, the water crisis was far from over.
And, of course, I knew it was going to take more than a series of photographs on my part to bring relief to the people in Vehicle City.
Shea and I bonded over our mothers and grandmothers.
Amber and I bonded over our battles with lupus.
Together, we decided to remain in each other's life and continue our creative efforts.
In 2017, Shea and Amber cofounded artist collective The Sister Tour, whose mission is to provide a safe space for Flint artists.
One year later, I mounted my solo exhibition, "Flint is Family," here in New York City at Gavin Brown's Enterprise on West 127th Street.
As the audience approaches the facade of the building, they see a 30-foot billboard.
The 30-foot billboard is made of three large color negatives with the message "Water Is Life," spelled out in Nestle water bottles by The Sister Tour.
Nestle, the largest water-bottling company in the world, pumps 400 gallons of water per minute out of aquifers in Lake Michigan, nearly free of charge.
This is a fundraiser print that I used to raise money to send The Sister Tour to different venues to educate people on the ongoing crisis.
This past June, Amber emailed me with the news that Michigan's attorney general dropped all criminal charges in the Flint Water Crisis investigation, where eight state and city employees were facing charges as serious as manslaughter.
I could no longer idly stand by and wait for the government to do its job.
Justice has been delayed, and justice has been denied.
It's been five years, and we're still waiting on justice for the men, women and children in Flint.
I asked Amber, "What can I do?
" She told me about a man named Moses West that she met in Puerto Rico, who invented a 26,000-pound atmospheric water generator.
Amber took Moses to elected officials in the city of Flint.
Nobody in Flint had that kind of money lying around.
And it was at that point that I decided to take the proceeds from my solo exhibition "Flint is Family," along with the generous match grant from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, and sent it to Moses West.
Teach them how to use the machine, teach them how to take care of it, and most importantly, take ownership of the machine.
Tell everybody across the city to bring all their containers and come and take as much water as they can stock up on, especially before the winter season hits; the machine doesn't extract moisture in freezing temperatures.
It mechanically creates condensation, which produces 2,000 gallons of water per day.
" She also told me that prior to the machine coming, she had severe headaches, and the water made her so sick to her stomach, she couldn't eat.
When he tasted the water, he thought to himself, "Now, this is the way God intended water to be.
As a school bus driver, Shea Cobb became the central figure of the photo essay, along with her mother, Ms. Renée, and her eight-year-old daughter, Zion.
I obsessively followed Shea's school bus routes.
And when Shea wasn't driving the bus, she would be watching over Zion, making sure she was studying.

Nestle, the largest water-bottling company in the world, pumps 400 gallons of water per minute out of aquifers in Lake Michigan, nearly free of charge.
The company also extracts millions of liters of water from First Nation reservations, while they have no access to clean water at all.
This is a fundraiser print that I used to raise money to send The Sister Tour to different venues to educate people on the ongoing crisis.
I also continued to keep it in the public eye by producing countdown flags that were raised on institutions across the country.
This past June, Amber emailed me with the news that Michigan's attorney general dropped all criminal charges in the Flint Water Crisis investigation, where eight state and city employees were facing charges as serious as manslaughter.
I could no longer idly stand by and wait for the government to do its job.

" She told me about a man named Moses West that she met in Puerto Rico, who invented a 26,000-pound atmospheric water generator.
Amber took Moses to elected officials in the city of Flint.
None of them seemed interested in bringing the machine for relief to Flint at all.
Amber needed to get the machine from a military base in Texas all the way to Flint.
Nobody in Flint had that kind of money lying around.
And it was at that point that I decided to take the proceeds from my solo exhibition "Flint is Family," along with the generous match grant from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, and sent it to Moses West.
This past July, Moses West and his atmospheric water generator arrived to Flint, Michigan, on North Saginaw between Marengo and Pulaski, and is actually still there right now, operating.
This community that sits three miles from downtown has been stripped of its schools, access to healthy grocery stores and clean water.
Socially, it's viewed as a violent, poor community.
But I see something completely different.
Moses, an officer, Ranger, veteran, was very clear about his water rescue mission: Bring relief of free, clean water to the people in Flint.
Teach them how to use the machine, teach them how to take care of it, and most importantly, take ownership of the machine.
Tell everybody across the city to bring all their containers and come and take as much water as they can stock up on, especially before the winter season hits; the machine doesn't extract moisture in freezing temperatures.
This technology pulls air through a high-volume air filter.
It mechanically creates condensation, which produces 2,000 gallons of water per day.
Residents are free to walk up to the machine anywhere between 9am and 8pm daily and take as much as they want, alleviating them from standing in long lines for bottled water.
I've been at the machine, interviewing people, asking them, "What does it mean to see Moses and his machine in [your] community?
" And, "What has it been like living without access to clean water?
" Alita told me, "It's a miracle that God gave Moses the knowledge and technology to provide us with pure drinking water.
" She also told me that prior to the machine coming, she had severe headaches, and the water made her so sick to her stomach, she couldn't eat.
Tina told me that the lead-contaminated water made her hair fall out.
Usually, she's weak and very light-headed.
Since using the machine, she's had energy and strength.
David, he was overwhelmed with joy that someone from Texas cared.
When he tasted the water, he thought to himself, "Now, this is the way God intended water to be.
" He brings three seven-gallon containers to refill to use at his barbecue stand.
Through creativity and solidarity, Amber Hasan, Shea Cobb, Tuklor Senegal, The Sister Tour, myself, the people of Flint, Dexter Moon, Moses West and his atmospheric water generator have been able to provide 120,000 gallons of free, clean water.
(Applause) The people in Flint deserve access to clean water.
Water is life.
It is the spirit that binds us from sickness, death and destruction.
Imagine how many millions of lives we could save if Moses's machine were in places like Newark, New Jersey, South Africa and India, with compassion instead of profit motives.
I loaded my camera, I locked my focus, and I placed my finger over the shutter release, as Shea and Zion went to take their first sip of clean water.
When the shutter released, I was overcome with a deep sense of joy and righteousness.
When I sent Shea some of the photographs, she wrote, "Thank you again for the light that you bring to my city.
" I immediately replied, "The light was already there within you.
" It's been four years since I've been photographing in Flint, and finally, I've been able to render a poetic justice.
No matter how dark a situation may be, a camera can extract the light and turn a negative into a positive.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Like many teachers, every year on the first day of school, I lead a sort of icebreaker activity with my students.
I teach at Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, and we are one of the oldest and most diverse high schools in our state.
Also, to our knowledge, we're the only high school in the world whose mascot is the Links. Like, a chain.
(Laughter) And with that being our mascot, we have a statue out front of our building of four links connected like a chain.
It can be something that they love, something that they hope for -- anything that describes their identity.
And then I go around the room with a stapler, and I staple each of those slips together to make a chain. And we hang that chain up in our classroom as a decoration, sure, but also as a reminder that we are all connected.
We are all links.
So what happens when one of those links feels weak?
And what happens when that weakness is in the person holding the stapler?
The person who's supposed to make those connections.
As teachers, we work every day to provide support socially, emotionally and academically to our students who come to us with diverse and tough circumstances.
Like most teachers, I have students who go home every day, and they sit around the kitchen table while one or both parents makes a healthy, well-rounded meal for them.
They spend suppertime summarizing the story they read in ninth-grade English that day, or explaining how Newton's laws of motion work.
But I also have students who go to the homeless shelter or to the group home.
They go to the car that their family is sleeping in right now.
The tough part about teaching is all the things you can't control for your kids, all the things you can't change for them once they walk out your door.
And so I wonder if it's always been this way.
I think back to my undergraduate training at the University of Georgia, where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of good teaching has changed.
Lectures and sitting in silent rows just doesn't cut it anymore.
I had David in class again that next year, and I learned that his father was undocumented and had been deported. He started acting out in school because all he wanted was for his family to be together again. In so many ways, I felt his pain.
And I needed someone to listen, somebody to provide support for me so that I could support him in this thing that I could not even comprehend. And we recognize that need for police officers who've witnessed a gruesome crime scene and nurses who have lost a patient.
But when it comes to teaching professionals, that urgency is lagging.
Many schools are doing what they can to fill in the gaps, starting with acknowledging that the work that we do is downright hard.
" They invite in community yoga teachers, they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together.
She knows that those five minutes can have an invaluable and powerful ripple effect across our school.
Somebody to reach out and make sure that we're OK. To check in with us and remind us that we are a link.
(Applause)Like many teachers, every year on the first day of school, I lead a sort of icebreaker activity with my students.

But I also have students who go to the homeless shelter or to the group home.
They go to the car that their family is sleeping in right now.
They come to school with trauma, and when I go home every day, that goes home with me.
And see, that's the hard part about teaching.
It's not the grading, the lesson-planning, the meetings, though sure, those things do occupy a great deal of teachers' time and energy.
The tough part about teaching is all the things you can't control for your kids, all the things you can't change for them once they walk out your door.
And so I wonder if it's always been this way.
I think back to my undergraduate training at the University of Georgia, where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of good teaching has changed.
We're not developing learners who are going to go out into a workforce where they'll stand on a line in a factory.
Rather, we're sending our kids out into a workforce where they need to be able to communicate, collaborate and problem-solve.
And that has caused teacher-student relationships to morph into something stronger than the giver of content and the receiver of knowledge.
Lectures and sitting in silent rows just doesn't cut it anymore.
We have to be able to build relationships with and among our students to help them feel connected in a world that depends on it.
I think back to my second year teaching. I had a student who I'll call "David. " And I remember feeling like I'd done a pretty good job at teaching that year: "Hey, I ain't no first-year teacher. I know what I'm doing.
" And it was on the last day of school, I told David to have a great summer.
And I watched him walk down the hall, and I thought to myself, I don't even know what his voice sounds like.
And that's when I realized I wasn't doing it right.
So I changed almost everything about my teaching.
I built in plenty of opportunities for my students to talk to me and to talk to each other, to share their writing and to verbalize their learning.
And it was through those conversations I began not only to know their voice but to know their pain.
I had David in class again that next year, and I learned that his father was undocumented and had been deported. He started acting out in school because all he wanted was for his family to be together again. In so many ways, I felt his pain.
And I needed someone to listen, somebody to provide support for me so that I could support him in this thing that I could not even comprehend. And we recognize that need for police officers who've witnessed a gruesome crime scene and nurses who have lost a patient.
But when it comes to teaching professionals, that urgency is lagging.
My interactions with colleagues and my own experiences make me feel like this is a universal struggle across all grade levels.So what are we missing?
What are we allowing to break the chain and how do we repair it?
I am so lucky.
But many small districts and even some large ones simply cannot foot the bill without aid.
Many schools are doing what they can to fill in the gaps, starting with acknowledging that the work that we do is downright hard.
Another school in Lincoln, Schoo Middle School, has what they call "Wellness Wednesdays.
" They invite in community yoga teachers, they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together.
She knows that those five minutes can have an invaluable and powerful ripple effect across our school.
And they have hope.
Isn't that what we all need?
Somebody to reach out and make sure that we're OK. To check in with us and remind us that we are a link.
Every now and then, we all just need a little help holding the stapler.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The second half of the last century was completely defined by a technological revolution: the software revolution.
The ability to program electrons on a material called silicon made possible technologies, companies and industries that were at one point unimaginable to many of us, but which have now fundamentally changed the way the world works.
The first half of this century, though, is going to be transformed by a new software revolution: the living software revolution.
And this will be powered by the ability to program biochemistry on a material called biology.
And doing so will enable us to harness the properties of biology to generate new kinds of therapies, to repair damaged tissue, to reprogram faulty cells or even build programmable operating systems out of biochemistry.
If we can realize this -- and we do need to realize it -- its impact will be so enormous that it will make the first software revolution pale in comparison.
And that's because living software would transform the entirety of medicine, agriculture and energy, and these are sectors that dwarf those dominated by IT.
Imagine programmable plants that fix nitrogen more effectively or resist emerging fungal pathogens, or even programming crops to be perennial rather than annual so you could double your crop yields each year.
That would transform agriculture and how we'll keep our growing and global population fed.
Or imagine programmable immunity, designing and harnessing molecular devices that guide your immune system to detect, eradicate or even prevent disease.
This would transform medicine and how we'll keep our growing and aging population healthy.
We already have many of the tools that will make living software a reality.
We can precisely edit genes with CRISPR.
We can rewrite the genetic code one base at a time.
We can even build functioning synthetic circuits out of DNA.
But figuring out how and when to wield these tools is still a process of trial and error.
It needs deep expertise, years of specialization.
And experimental protocols are difficult to discover and all too often, difficult to reproduce.
And, you know, we have a tendency in biology to focus a lot on the parts, but we all know that something like flying wouldn't be understood by only studying feathers. So programming biology is not yet as simple as programming your computer.
And then to make matters worse, living systems largely bear no resemblance to the engineered systems that you and I program every day.
In contrast to engineered systems, living systems self-generate, they self-organize, they operate at molecular scales.
And these molecular-level interactions lead generally to robust macro-scale output.
They can even self-repair.
Consider, for example, the humble household plant, like that one sat on your mantelpiece at home that you keep forgetting to water. Every day, despite your neglect, that plant has to wake up and figure out how to allocate its resources.
Will it grow, photosynthesize, produce seeds, or flower?
And that's a decision that has to be made at the level of the whole organism.
But a plant doesn't have a brain to figure all of that out.
It has to make do with the cells on its leaves.
They have to respond to the environment and make the decisions that affect the whole plant.
So somehow there must be a program running inside these cells, a program that responds to input signals and cues and shapes what that cell will do.
And then those programs must operate in a distributed way across individual cells, so that they can coordinate and that plant can grow and flourish.
If we could understand these biological programs, if we could understand biological computation, it would transform our ability to understand how and why cells do what they do.
Because, if we understood these programs, we could debug them when things go wrong. Or we could learn from them how to design the kind of synthetic circuits that truly exploit the computational power of biochemistry.
My passion about this idea led me to a career in research at the interface of maths, computer science and biology.
And in my work, I focus on the concept of biology as computation. And that means asking what do cells compute, and how can we uncover these biological programs?
And I started to ask these questions together with some brilliant collaborators at Microsoft Research and the University of Cambridge, where together we wanted to understand the biological program running inside a unique type of cell: an embryonic stem cell.
These cells are unique because they're totally naïve.
But realizing that vision is not without its challenges, not least because these particular cells, they emerge just six days after conception. And then within a day or so, they're gone. They have set off down the different paths that form all the structures and organs of your adult body.
Now, computer science actually has a set of strategies for dealing with what it is the software and hardware are meant to do. When you write a program, you code a piece of software, you want that software to run correctly. You want performance, functionality. You want to prevent bugs.
So we just needed to figure out a way to encode this new type of specification. So let's say you've been busy in the lab and you've been measuring your genes and you've found that if Gene A is active, then Gene B or Gene C seems to be active.
We can write that observation down as a mathematical expression if we can use the language of logic: If A, then B or C.
Now, this is a very simple example, OK.
And this tool was actually built on a solver that's deployed routinely around the world for conventional software verification. So we started with a set of nearly 50 different specifications that we generated from experimental observations of embryonic stem cells.
And by encoding these observations in this tool, we were able to uncover the first molecular program that could explain all of them.
Now, that's kind of a feat in and of itself, right?
Being able to reconcile all of these different observations is not the kind of thing you can do on the back of an envelope, even if you have a really big envelope.
Because we've got this kind of understanding, we could go one step further.
We could use this program to predict what this cell might do in conditions we hadn't yet tested.
We could probe the program in silico.
And so we did just that: we generated predictions that we tested in the lab, and we found that this program was highly predictive.
It told us how we could accelerate progress back to the naïve state quickly and efficiently.
It told us which genes to target to do that, which genes might even hinder that process.
We even found the program predicted the order in which genes would switch on.
So this approach really allowed us to uncover the dynamics of what the cells are doing.
What we've developed, it's not a method that's specific to stem cell biology.
Only this kind of transformative understanding will enable us to harness biology in ways that are predictable and reliable.
But to program biology, we will also need to develop the kinds of tools and languages that allow both experimentalists and computational scientists to design biological function and have those designs compile down to the machine code of the cell, its biochemistry, so that we could then build those structures.
In the long term, it's worth remembering that many of the giant software companies and the technology that you and I work with every day could hardly have been imagined at the time we first started programming on silicon microchips.
And if we start now to think about the potential for technology enabled by computational biology, we'll see some of the steps that we need to take along the way to make that a reality.
Now, there is the sobering thought that this kind of technology could be open to misuse.
If we're willing to talk about the potential for programming immune cells, we should also be thinking about the potential of bacteria engineered to evade them.
There might be people willing to do that.
Now, one reassuring thought in this is that -- well, less so for the scientists -- is that biology is a fragile thing to work with.
So programming biology is not going to be something you'll be doing in your garden shed.
But because we're at the outset of this, we can move forward with our eyes wide open.
We can ask the difficult questions up front, we can put in place the necessary safeguards and, as part of that, we'll have to think about our ethics.
We'll have to think about putting bounds on the implementation of biological function.
So as part of this, research in bioethics will have to be a priority.
It can't be relegated to second place in the excitement of scientific innovation.
But the ultimate prize, the ultimate destination on this journey, would be breakthrough applications and breakthrough industries in areas from agriculture and medicine to energy and materials and even computing itself.
Imagine, one day we could be powering the planet sustainably on the ultimate green energy if we could mimic something that plants figured out millennia ago: how to harness the sun's energy with an efficiency that is unparalleled by our current solar cells.
If we understood that program of quantum interactions that allow plants to absorb sunlight so efficiently, we might be able to translate that into building synthetic DNA circuits that offer the material for better solar cells.
There are teams and scientists working on the fundamentals of this right now, so perhaps if it got the right attention and the right investment, it could be realized in 10 or 15 years.
So we are at the beginning of a technological revolution.
Understanding this ancient type of biological computation is the critical first step.
And if we can realize this, we would enter in the era of an operating system that runs living software.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I am a labor organizer, and in 2013, I cofounded an organization called coworker. org that uses technology to help people join with coworkers and organize for improvements in the workplace.
Now, there are two kinds of reactions to what I do.
Actually, no, there are three.
The first is complete confusion about what organizing is.
When my doctor asked what I do and I told him, he thought I meant organizing, like, Marie Kondo-style.
(Laughter) He was like, "Oh, that's so great, I could use some of that around here.
Finally, there's the third reaction, the excited one, the, "Oh my God, yes!
We need this!
So why does my work stir up such strong reactions?
But if you lack power, or you know someone who lacks it and needs it, you might grab me by the shoulders and shake me, you're so pumped.
The power imbalance in our workplace is real, and it's constantly changing.
Power moves between us, depending on our roles and status.
Now, sometimes this can feel like office politics, right?
And it's that kind of productive conflict that I want to talk to you all about today, the kind that can make some of us uncomfortable.
Well, let me tell you a story.
Within days, employees from around the country began joining Alex's effort and sharing their own stories about what they were earning -- 11, 12 dollars an hour -- and how that wage was impacting their lives.
And that's what I mean by productive conflict: pushing up against the things that aren't working for us when there exists no other path forward.
I expected the worst jobs, the worst workplaces, to have the most employee activism on our site, but the opposite is often true.
When my doctor asked what I do and I told him, he thought I meant organizing, like, Marie Kondo-style.
(Laughter) Yeah, and that's the second kind of reaction: the uncomfortable kind.
People usually withdraw from the conversation and find someone else to talk to.
Finally, there's the third reaction, the excited one, the, "Oh my God, yes!
We need this!
" And someone always proceeds to tell me a story.
It's always a story about a job or a coworker or a friend who's enduring something awful at work.
What I've noticed is that there is never a neutral response to what I do.
You're either repelled by it, or you're struck with a lightning bolt of excitement.
So why does my work stir up such strong reactions?
My hunch is that it's about conflict.
If you have power in your workplace, maybe as a CEO or a senior leader of some kind, you're going to feel uncomfortable with that power being challenged.
But if you lack power, or you know someone who lacks it and needs it, you might grab me by the shoulders and shake me, you're so pumped.
But really, we can all benefit from understanding what conflict can offer in our workplaces.
The power imbalance in our workplace is real, and it's constantly changing.
Power moves between us, depending on our roles and status.
Now, sometimes this can feel like office politics, right?
Which is never fun.
But when we contest for power thoughtfully and together with our coworkers, it can be incredibly productive.
And it's that kind of productive conflict that I want to talk to you all about today, the kind that can make some of us uncomfortable.
Business leaders should embrace when their workers conflict with policies and decisions, both for what it teaches us and for what it says about our commitment to each other.
So what do I mean by "productive conflict"?
Well, let me tell you a story.
In 2016, a store employee for an outdoor retailer -- I'll call her "Alex" -- Alex approached her boss and asked for a raise.
Now, she was told her pay was fairly standard for her position and that her boss didn't even have the authority to give such a raise.
And that was supposed to be the end of the conversation.
Unhappy with that answer, Alex went home, and she decided to create a campaign on coworker. org, asking the corporate office to give raises to store employees.
Within days, employees from around the country began joining Alex's effort and sharing their own stories about what they were earning -- 11, 12 dollars an hour -- and how that wage was impacting their lives.
Well, after weeks of this groundswell of employee activism, the company decided to raise wages by five to 15 percent in cities across the country.
And that's what I mean by productive conflict: pushing up against the things that aren't working for us when there exists no other path forward.
The other thing I learned in doing this work is that people engage in productive conflict when they care about their jobs and their coworkers.
Now, that surprised me at first.
I expected the worst jobs, the worst workplaces, to have the most employee activism on our site, but the opposite is often true.
When we come together, we can accomplish great things.
At one company, there are more than 50 campaigns by employees there on issues ranging from dress code changes to legitimate safety concerns.
And get this: that same company has the lowest voluntary turnover rate of any major chain in its sector.
And it also has one of the higher productivity rates as well.
Business leaders: you shouldn't fear conflict, and you shouldn't try to tamp down on it the minute it bubbles up in your workforce.
While it can introduce uncertainties that can be difficult to manage, those uncertainties are trying to tell you something about an underlying problem that needs your attention.
And I think this is especially important right now, you know, as technology transforms nearly everyone's job and as the structures that contain our work are changing at a pace not seen since the Industrial Revolution.
We all need to be shaping and participating in the future of work.
We all need to be challenging and changing the parts of our work lives that are broken.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So I stand before you as an evolutionary biologist, a professor of evolutionary biology, which sounds like a rather fancy title, if I may say so myself.
And I'm going to talk about two topics that aren't normally talked about together, and that's market economies and fungi.
Or is it fun-GUY, or, as we say in Europe now, fun-GEE?
There's still no consensus on how to say this word.
So I want you to imagine a market economy that's 400 million years old, one that's so ubiquitous that it operates in almost every ecosystem of the world, so huge that it can connect millions of traders simultaneously, and so persistent that it survived mass extinctions.
It's here, right now, under our feet.
You just can't see it.
And unlike human economies that rely on cognition to make decisions, traders in this market, they beg, borrow, steal, cheat, all in the absence of thought.
So hidden from our eyes, plant roots are colonized by a fungus called arbuscule mycorrhizae.
Now the fungus forms these complex networks underground of fine filaments thinner than even threads of cotton.
So follow one of these fungi, and it connects multiple plants simultaneously.
You can think of it as an underground subway system, where each root is a station, where resources are loaded and unloaded.
And it's also very dense, so roughly the length of many meters, even a kilometer, in a single gram of dirt.
So that's the length of 10 football fields in just a thimbleful of soil.
And it's everywhere.
So if you passed over a tree, a shrub, a vine, even a tiny weed, you passed over a mycorrhizal network.
Roughly 80 percent of all plant species are associated with these mycorrhizal fungi.
So what does a root covered in fungi have to do with our global economy?
And why as an evolutionary biologist have I spent the last 10 years of my life learning economic jargon?
Well, the first thing you need to understand is that trade deals made by plant and fungal partners are surprisingly similar to those made by us, but perhaps even more strategic.
You see, plant and fungal partners, they're not exchanging stocks and bonds, they're exchanging essential resources, and for the fungus, that's sugars and fats.
It gets all of its carbon directly from the plant partner.
So much carbon, so every year, roughly five billion tons of carbon from plants go into this network underground.
For the root, what they need is phosphorus and nitrogen, so by exchanging their carbon they get access to all of the nutrients collected by that fungal network.
So to make the trade, the fungus penetrates into the root cell of the host and forms a tiny structure called an arbuscule, which is Latin for "little tree.
" Now, you can think of this as the physical stock exchange of the trade market.
So up until now, it seems very harmonious.
Right?
I scratch your back, you scratch mine, both partners get what they need. But here is where we need to pause and understand the power of evolution and natural selection.
You see, there's no room for amateur traders on this market.
Making the right trade strategy determines who lives and who dies.
Now, I use the word strategy, but of course plant and fungi, they don't have brains.
They're making these exchanges in the absence of anything that we would consider as thought. But, as scientists, we use behavioral terms such as strategy to describe behaviors to certain conditions, actions and reactions that are actually programmed into the DNA of the organism.
So I started studying these trade strategies when I was 19 years old and I was living in the tropical rainforests of Panama.
Now, everybody at the time was interested in this incredible diversity aboveground.
And it was hyperdiversity.
These are tropical rainforests.
But I was interested in the complexity belowground.
We knew that the networks existed, and we knew they were important, and I'm going to say it again, by important I mean important, so the basis of all plant nutrition for all the diversity that you do see aboveground.
But at the time, we didn't know how these networks worked.
We didn't know how they functioned.
Why did only certain plants interact with certain fungi?
So fast-forward to when I started my own group, and we really began to play with this trade market.
You see, we would manipulate conditions.
We would create a good trading partner by growing a plant in the sun and a poor trading partner by growing it in the shade.
We would then connect these with a fungal network.
And we found that the fungi were consistently good at discriminating among good and bad trading partners.
They would allocate more resources to the host plant giving them more carbon.
Now, we would run the reciprocal experiments where we would inoculate a host plant with good and bad fungi, and they were also good at discriminating between these trade partners.
So what you have there is the perfect conditions for a market to emerge.
It's a simple market, but it's a market nonetheless, where the better trading partner is consistently favored.
But is it a fair market?
Now this is where you need to understand that, like humans, plants and fungi are incredibly opportunistic. There's evidence that the fungus, once it penetrates into the plant cell, it can actually hijack the plant's own nutrient uptake system.
It does this by suppressing the plant's own ability to take up nutrients from the soil.
So this creates a dependency of the plant on the fungus.
It's a false addiction, of sorts, whereby the plant has to feed the fungus just to get access to the resources right around its own root.
There's also evidence that the fungi are good at inflating the price of nutrients.
They do this by extracting the nutrients from the soil, but then rather than trading them with the host, they hoard them in their network, so this makes them unavailable to the plant and other competing fungi.
So basic economics, as resource availability goes down, the value goes up.
The plant is forced to pay more for the same amount of resources.
But it's not all in favor of the fungus.
Plants can be extremely cunning as well.
There are some orchids -- and I always think orchids somehow seem like the most devious of the plant species in the world -- and there are some orchids that just tap directly into the network and steal all their carbon.
So these orchids, they don't even make green leaves to photosynthesize.
They're just white.
So rather than photosynthesizing, tap into the network, steal the carbon and give nothing in return.
Now I think it's fair to say that these types of parasites also flourish in our human markets.
So as we began to decode these strategies, we learned some lessons.
And the first one was that there's no altruism in this system.
There's no trade favors.
We don't see strong evidence of the fungus helping dying or struggling plants unless it directly benefits the fungus itself.
Now I'm not saying if this is good or bad.
Unlike humans, a fungus, of course, cannot judge its own morality.
And as a biologist, I'm not advocating for these types of ruthless neoliberal market dynamics enacted by the fungi.
So we've made progress in decoding the most basic trade principles at this point, but as scientists we always want to take it one step further, and we're interested in more complex economic dilemmas.
And specifically we're interested in the effects of inequality.
So inequality has really become a defining feature of today's economic landscape.
I think as humans we tend to think that everything's unique to us, but organisms in nature must face relentless variation in their access to resources.
How does a fungus that can again be meters long change its trade strategy when it's exposed simultaneously to a rich patch and a poor patch?
And, more generally, how do organisms in nature use trade to their advantage when they're faced with uncertainty in terms of their access to resources?
Here's where I have to let you in on a secret: studying trade underground is incredibly difficult.
You can't see where or when important trade deals take place.
What the quantum dots allow us to do is actually light up the nutrients so we can visually track their movements across the fungal network and into the host root.
So this allows us finally to see the unseen, so we can study how fungi bargain at a small scale with their plant hosts. So to study inequality, we exposed a fungal network to these varying concentrations of fluorescing phosphorus, mimicking patches of abundance and scarcity across this artificial landscape.
This is important, because it suggests that evolving a trade partnership in nature can help organisms cope with the uncertainty of accessing resources.
Simply by changing where across the network the fungus was trading, it could manipulate the value of those resources.
It suggests a high level of sophistication, or at least a medium level of sophistication in an organism with no cognition.
So we wanted to look about information and how it's shared across this network, how the fungus integrates cues.
So what you're looking at right now is a living fungal network with the cellular contents moving across it.
This is what is happening under our feet right now.
Now here's where we can potentially borrow models from nature.
And I'm going to talk about two topics that aren't normally talked about together, and that's market economies and fungi.
There's still no consensus on how to say this word.
And unlike human economies that rely on cognition to make decisions, traders in this market, they beg, borrow, steal, cheat, all in the absence of thought.
So that's the length of 10 football fields in just a thimbleful of soil.
Roughly 80 percent of all plant species are associated with these mycorrhizal fungi.
You see, we would manipulate conditions.
But is it a fair market?
Now this is where you need to understand that, like humans, plants and fungi are incredibly opportunistic. There's evidence that the fungus, once it penetrates into the plant cell, it can actually hijack the plant's own nutrient uptake system.
So basic economics, as resource availability goes down, the value goes up.
So we've made progress in decoding the most basic trade principles at this point, but as scientists we always want to take it one step further, and we're interested in more complex economic dilemmas.
But the challenges of inequality are not unique to the human world.
I think as humans we tend to think that everything's unique to us, but organisms in nature must face relentless variation in their access to resources.
How does a fungus that can again be meters long change its trade strategy when it's exposed simultaneously to a rich patch and a poor patch?
And, more generally, how do organisms in nature use trade to their advantage when they're faced with uncertainty in terms of their access to resources?
Here's where I have to let you in on a secret: studying trade underground is incredibly difficult.
You can't see where or when important trade deals take place.
So our group helped pioneer a method, a technology, whereby we could tag nutrients with nanoparticles, fluorescing nanoparticles called quantum dots.
What the quantum dots allow us to do is actually light up the nutrients so we can visually track their movements across the fungal network and into the host root.
So this allows us finally to see the unseen, so we can study how fungi bargain at a small scale with their plant hosts. So to study inequality, we exposed a fungal network to these varying concentrations of fluorescing phosphorus, mimicking patches of abundance and scarcity across this artificial landscape.
We then carefully quantified fungal trade.
And we found two things.
The first thing we found was that inequality encouraged the fungus to trade more.
So I can use the word "encouraged" or "stimulated" or "forced," but the bottom line is that compared to control conditions, inequality was associated with higher levels of trade.
This is important, because it suggests that evolving a trade partnership in nature can help organisms cope with the uncertainty of accessing resources.
Second, we found that, exposed to inequality, the fungus would move resources from the rich patch of the network, actively transport them to the poor side of the network.
Now, of course, we could see this because the patches were fluorescing in different colors.
So at first, this result was incredibly puzzling.
Was it to help the poor side of the network? No. We found that the fungus gained more by first moving the resources to where demand was higher.
Simply by changing where across the network the fungus was trading, it could manipulate the value of those resources.
Now this stimulated us to really dig deeper into how information is shared.
It suggests a high level of sophistication, or at least a medium level of sophistication in an organism with no cognition.
How is it that a fungus can sense market conditions across its network and then make calculations of where and when to trade?
So we wanted to look about information and how it's shared across this network, how the fungus integrates cues.
So to do that, what you need to do is dive deep in and get a higher resolution into the network itself.
We began to study complex flows inside the hyphal network.
So what you're looking at right now is a living fungal network with the cellular contents moving across it.
This is happening in real time, so you can see the time stamp up there.
So this is happening right now.
This video isn't sped up.
This is what is happening under our feet right now.
And there's a couple of things that I want you to notice.
It speeds up, it slows down, it switches directions.
So we're working now with biophysicists to try to dissect this complexity.
How is the fungus using these complex flow patterns to share and process information and make these trade decisions?
Are fungi better at making trade calculations than us?
Now here's where we can potentially borrow models from nature.
We're increasingly reliant on computer algorithms to make us profitable trades in split-second time scales.
But computer algorithms and fungi, they both operate in similar, uncognitive ways.
The fungi just happens to be a living machine.
What would happen if we compare and compete the trading strategies of these two?
My money is on the fungus.Thank you.
Known examples are glucose, fructose, fats, cholesterol -- things we hear all the time.
Understanding metabolites is essential to find treatments for many diseases.
And fatty liver disease is just one example.
And we will get closer to reach our vision of saving lives with every line of code.
Thank you.
(Applause)In 2003, when we sequenced the human genome, we thought we would have the answer to treat many diseases.
But the reality is far from that, because in addition to our genes, our environment and lifestyle could have a significant role in developing many major diseases.
One example is fatty liver disease, which is affecting over 20 percent of the population globally, and it has no treatment and leads to liver cancer or liver failure.
So sequencing DNA alone doesn't give us enough information to find effective therapeutics.
On the bright side, there are many other molecules in our body.
In fact, there are over 100,000 metabolites.
Metabolites are any molecule that is supersmall in their size.
Known examples are glucose, fructose, fats, cholesterol -- things we hear all the time.
Metabolites are involved in our metabolism.
They are also downstream of DNA, so they carry information from both our genes as well as lifestyle.
Understanding metabolites is essential to find treatments for many diseases.
I've always wanted to treat patients.
Despite that, 15 years ago, I left medical school, as I missed mathematics.
Soon after, I found the coolest thing: I can use mathematics to study medicine.
Since then, I've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data.
So, it sounded easy: let's collect data from all the metabolites in our body, develop mathematical models to describe how they are changed in a disease and intervene in those changes to treat them.
Then I realized why no one has done this before: it's extremely difficult.
(Laughter) There are many metabolites in our body.
Each one is different from the other one.
For some metabolites, we can measure their molecular mass using mass spectrometry instruments.
But because there could be, like, 10 molecules with the exact same mass, we don't know exactly what they are, and if you want to clearly identify all of them, you have to do more experiments, which could take decades and billions of dollars.
So we developed an artificial intelligence, or AI, platform, to do that.
We leveraged the growth of biological data and built a database of any existing information about metabolites and their interactions with other molecules.
We combined all this data as a meganetwork.
Then, from tissues or blood of patients, we measure masses of metabolites and find the masses that are changed in a disease.
But, as I mentioned earlier, we don't know exactly what they are.
A molecular mass of 180 could be either the glucose, galactose or fructose.
They all have the exact same mass but different functions in our body.
Our AI algorithm considered all these ambiguities.
It then mined that meganetwork to find how those metabolic masses are connected to each other that result in disease.
And because of the way they are connected, then we are able to infer what each metabolite mass is, like that 180 could be glucose here, and, more importantly, to discover how changes in glucose and other metabolites lead to a disease.
This novel understanding of disease mechanisms then enable us to discover effective therapeutics to target that.
So we formed a start-up company to bring this technology to the market and impact people's lives.
Now my team and I at ReviveMed are working to discover therapeutics for major diseases that metabolites are key drivers for, like fatty liver disease, because it is caused by accumulation of fats, which are types of metabolites in the liver.
As I mentioned earlier, it's a huge epidemic with no treatment.
And fatty liver disease is just one example.
Moving forward, we are going to tackle hundreds of other diseases with no treatment.
And by collecting more and more data about metabolites and understanding how changes in metabolites leads to developing diseases, our algorithms will get smarter and smarter to discover the right therapeutics for the right patients.
And we will get closer to reach our vision of saving lives with every line of code.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So, you've been obsessed with this problem for the last few years.
What is the problem, in your own words?
Andrew Forrest: Plastic.
Simple as that.
Our inability to use it for the tremendous energetic commodity that it is, and just throw it away.
CA: And so we see waste everywhere.
At its extreme, it looks a bit like this.
I mean, where was this picture taken?
AF: That's in the Philippines, and you know, there's a lot of rivers, ladies and gentlemen, which look exactly like that.
And that's the Philippines. So it's all over Southeast Asia.
CA: So plastic is thrown into the rivers, and from there, of course, it ends up in the ocean.
I mean, we obviously see it on the beaches, but that's not even your main concern.
It's what's actually happening to it in the oceans.
Talk about that.
AF: OK, so look.
Thank you, Chris.
About four years ago, I thought I'd do something really barking crazy, and I committed to do a PhD in marine ecology.
CA: But people think of plastic as ugly but stable.
Right?
You throw something in the ocean, "Hey, it'll just sit there forever.
Can't do any damage, right?
" AF: See, Chris, it's an incredible substance designed for the economy.
It is the worst substance possible for the environment.
The worst thing about plastics, as soon as it hits the environment, is that it fragments.
It never stops being plastic.
It breaks down smaller and smaller and smaller, and the breaking science on this, Chris, which we've known in marine ecology for a few years now, but it's going to hit humans.
We are aware now that nanoplastic, the very, very small particles of plastic, carrying their negative charge, can go straight through the pores of your skin.
That's not the bad news.
The bad news is that it goes straight through the blood-brain barrier, that protective coating which is there to protect your brain.
Your brain's a little amorphous, wet mass full of little electrical charges.
You put a negative particle into that, particularly a negative particle which can carry pathogens -- so you have a negative charge, it attracts positive-charge elements, like pathogens, toxins, mercury, lead.
That's the breaking science we're going to see in the next 12 months.
CA: So already I think you told me that there's like 600 plastic bags or so for every fish that size in the ocean, something like that.
And they're breaking down, and there's going to be ever more of them, and we haven't even seen the start of the consequences of that.
AF: No, we really haven't.
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, they're a bunch of good scientists, we've been working with them for a while.
I've completely verified their work.
They say there will be one ton of plastic, Chris, for every three tons of fish by, not 2050 -- and I really get impatient with people who talk about 2050 -- by 2025. That's around the corner.
That's just the here and now.
You don't need one ton of plastic to completely wipe out marine life.
Less than that is going to do a fine job at it.
So we have to end it straightaway.
We've got no time.
CA: OK, so you have an idea for ending it, and you're coming at this not as a typical environmental campaigner, I would say, but as a businessman, as an entrepreneur, who has lived -- you've spent your whole life thinking about global economic systems and how they work.
And if I understand it right, your idea depends on heroes who look something like this.
What's her profession?
AF: She, Chris, is a ragpicker, and there were 15, 20 million ragpickers like her, until China stopped taking everyone's waste.
And the price of plastic, minuscule that it was, collapsed.
That led to people like her, which, now -- she is a child who is a schoolchild.
She should be at school.
That's probably very akin to slavery.
My daughter Grace and I have met hundreds of people like her.
CA: And there are many adults as well, literally millions around the world, and in some industries, they actually account for the fact that, for example, we don't see a lot of metal waste in the world.
AF: That's exactly right.
That little girl is, in fact, the hero of the environment.
She's in competition with a great big petrochemical plant which is just down the road, the three-and-a-half-billion-dollar petrochemical plant.
That's the problem.
We've got more oil and gas in plastic and landfill than we have in the entire oil and gas resources of the United States.
So she is the hero.
CA: So there's huge value potentially locked up in there that the world's ragpickers would, if they could, make a living from.
But why can't they?
AF: Because we have ingrained in us a price of plastic from fossil fuels, which sits just under what it takes to economically and profitably recycle plastic from plastic.
See, all plastic is is building blocks from oil and gas.
Plastic's 100 percent polymer, which is 100 percent oil and gas.
And you know we've got enough plastic in the world for all our needs.
And when we recycle plastic, if we can't recycle it cheaper than fossil fuel plastic, then, of course, the world just sticks to fossil fuel plastic.
CA: So that's the fundamental problem, the price of recycled plastic is usually more than the price of just buying it made fresh from more oil.
That's the fundamental problem.
AF: A slight tweak of the rules here, Chris.
I'm a commodity person.
I understand that we used to have scrap metal and rubbish iron and bits of copper lying all round the villages, particularly in the developing world.
And people worked out it's got a value.
It's actually an article of value, not of waste.
Now the villages and the cities and the streets are clean, you don't trip over scrap copper or scrap iron now, because it's an article of value, it gets recycled.
CA: So what's your idea, then, to try to change that in plastics?
AF: OK, so Chris, for most part of that PhD, I've been doing research.
And the good thing about being a businessperson who's done OK at it is that people want to see you.
Other businesspeople, even if you're kind of a bit of a zoo animal species they'd like to check out, they'll say, yeah, OK, we'll all meet Twiggy Forrest.
And so once you're in there, you can interrogate them.
And I've been to most of the oil and gas and fast-moving consumer good companies in the world, and there is a real will to change.
I mean, there's a couple of dinosaurs who are going to hope for the best and do nothing, but there's a real will to change.
So what I've been discussing is, the seven and a half billion people in the world don't actually deserve to have their environment smashed by plastic, their oceans rendered depauperate or barren of sea life because of plastic.
So you come down that chain, and there's tens of thousands of brands which we all buy heaps of products from, but then there's only a hundred major resin producers, big petrochemical plants, that spew out all the plastic which is single use.
CA: So one hundred companies are right at the base of this food chain, as it were.
AF: Yeah.
CA: And so what do you need those one hundred companies to do?
CA: Like, what, like a cent extra?
AF: Less.
Quarter of a cent, half a cent.
It'll be absolutely minimal.
But what it does, it makes every bit of plastic all over the world an article of value.
Where you have the waste worst, say Southeast Asia, India, that's where the wealth is most.
CA: OK, so it feels like there's two parts to this.
One is, if they will charge more money but carve out that excess and pay it -- into what?
-- a fund operated by someone to tackle this problem of -- what?
What would that money be used for, that they charge the extra for?
AF: So when I speak to really big businesses, I say, "Look, I need you to change, and I need you to change really fast," their eyes are going to peel over in boredom, unless I say, "And it's good business.
" "OK, now you've got my attention, Andrew.
" So I say, "Right, I need you to make a contribution to an environmental and industry transition fund.
Over two or three years, the entire global plastics industry can transition from getting its building blocks from fossil fuel to getting its building blocks from plastic.
The technology is out there.
It's proven.
" I've taken two multibillion-dollar operations from nothing, recognizing that the technology can be scaled.
I see at least a dozen technologies in plastic to handle all types of plastic.
So once those technologies have an economic margin, which this gives them, that's where the global public will get all their plastic from, from existing plastic.
CA: So every sale of virgin plastic contributes money to a fund that is used to basically transition the industry and start to pay for things like cleanup and other pieces.
AF: Absolutely. Absolutely. CA: And it has the incredible side benefit, which is maybe even the main benefit, of creating a market.
It suddenly makes recyclable plastic a giant business that can unlock millions of people around the world to find a new living collecting it.
AF: Yeah, exactly.
So all you do is, you've got fossil fuel plastics at this value and recycled plastic at this value.
You change it.
So recycled plastic is cheaper.
What I love about this most, Chris, is that, you know, we waste into the environment 300, 350 million tons of plastic.
On the oil and gas companies own accounts, it's going to grow to 500 million tons.
This is an accelerating problem.
Polymer is 1,000 dollars, 1,500 dollars a ton.
Yet we throw it away.
CA: So this would allow the big companies to invest in recycling plants literally all over the world -- AF: All over the world.
Because the technology is low-capital cost, you can put it in at rubbish dumps, at the bottom of big hotels, garbage depots, everywhere, turn that waste into resin.
CA: Now, you're a philanthropist, and you're ready to commit some of your own wealth to this.
What is the role of philanthropy in this project?
AF: I think what we have to do is kick in the 40 to 50 million US dollars to get it going, and then we have to create absolute transparency so everyone can see exactly what's going on.
And that'll cost about a million dollars a week, and we're going to underwrite that for five years.
Total contribution is circa 300 million US dollars.
CA: Wow.
Now -- (Applause) You've talked to other companies, like to the Coca-Colas of this world, who are willing to do this, they're willing to pay a higher price, they would like to pay a higher price, so long as it's fair.
So, Coca-Cola wouldn't like Pepsi to play ball unless the whole world knew that Pepsi wasn't playing ball.
Then they don't care.
So it's that transparency of the market where, if people try and cheat the system, the market can see it, the consumers can see it.
Seven and a half billion of us.
We don't want our world smashed by a hundred companies.
What can people listening do?
AF: OK, so I would like all of us, all around the world, to go a website called noplasticwaste. org. You contact your hundred resin producers which are in your region.
You will have at least one within an email or Twitter or a telephone contact from you, and let them know that you would like them to make a contribution to a fund which industry can manage or the World Bank can manage.
It raises tens of billions of dollars per year so you can transition the industry to getting all its plastic from plastic, not from fossil fuel.
We don't need that.
That's bad.
This is good.
And it can clean up the environment.
CA: You're in the recycling business.
AF: Yeah, look, I'm in the iron ore business, and I compete against the scrap metal business, and that's why you don't have any scrap lying around to trip over, and cut your toe on, because it gets collected.
CA: This isn't your excuse to go into the plastic recycling business.
AF: No, I am going to cheer for this boom.
So I'm going to cheer for it and stand back.
(Applause)Chris Anderson: So, you've been obsessed with this problem for the last few years.

AF: I think what we have to do is kick in the 40 to 50 million US dollars to get it going, and then we have to create absolute transparency so everyone can see exactly what's going on.
From the resin producers to the brands to the consumers, everyone gets to see who is playing the game, who is protecting the Earth, and who doesn't care.
And that'll cost about a million dollars a week, and we're going to underwrite that for five years.
Total contribution is circa 300 million US dollars.
CA: Wow.
Now -- (Applause) You've talked to other companies, like to the Coca-Colas of this world, who are willing to do this, they're willing to pay a higher price, they would like to pay a higher price, so long as it's fair.

The consumers want a role to play in this.
Seven and a half billion of us.
We don't want our world smashed by a hundred companies.
CA: Well, so tell us, you've said what the companies can do and what you're willing to do.
What can people listening do?
AF: OK, so I would like all of us, all around the world, to go a website called noplasticwaste. org. You contact your hundred resin producers which are in your region.
You will have at least one within an email or Twitter or a telephone contact from you, and let them know that you would like them to make a contribution to a fund which industry can manage or the World Bank can manage.

We don't need that.
That's bad.
This is good.
And it can clean up the environment.
We've got enough capital there, we've got tens of billions of dollars, Chris, per annum to clean up the environment.
CA: You're in the recycling business.
Isn't this a conflict of interest for you, or rather, a huge business opportunity for you?
AF: Yeah, look, I'm in the iron ore business, and I compete against the scrap metal business, and that's why you don't have any scrap lying around to trip over, and cut your toe on, because it gets collected.
CA: This isn't your excuse to go into the plastic recycling business.
AF: No, I am going to cheer for this boom.
This will be the internet of plastic waste.
This will be a boom industry which will spread all over the world, and particularly where poverty is worst because that's where the rubbish is most, and that's the resource.
So I'm going to cheer for it and stand back.
CA: Twiggy, we're in an era where so many people around the world are craving a new, regenerative economy, these big supply chains, these big industries, to fundamentally transform.
It strikes me as a giant idea, and you're going to need a lot of people cheering you on your way to make it happen.
Thank you for sharing this with us.
AF: Thank you very much.
Thank you, Chris.
(Applause)
Hello. My name is Herman, and I've always been struck by how the most important, impactful, tsunami-like changes to our culture and our society always come from those things that we least think are going to have that impact.
I mean, as a computer scientist, I remember when Facebook was just image-sharing in dorm rooms, and depending upon who you ask, it's now involved in toppling elections.
I remember when cryptocurrency or automated trading were sort of ideas by a few renegades in the financial institutions in the world for automated trading, or online, for cryptocurrency, and they're now coming to quickly shape the way that we operate.
And I think each of you can recall that moment where one of these ideas felt like some ignorable, derisive thing, and suddenly, oh, crap, the price of Bitcoin is what it is.
Or, oh, crap, guess who's been elected.
So that's a bold claim, OK.
I see some skeptical faces in the audience.
But if we take a moment to try to look at what video games are already becoming in our lives today, and what just a little bit of technological advancement is about to create, it starts to become more of an inevitability.
And I think the possibilities are quite electrifying.
So let's just take a moment to think about scale.
I mean, there's already 2.6 billion people who play games.
And the reality is that's a billion more than five years ago.
A billion more people in that time.
No religion, no media, nothing has spread like that.
It's not six, it's not 18, it's not 12. It's 34. [Average age of an American gamer] It's older than me.
And that tells us something, that this isn't entertainment for children anymore.
This is already a medium like literature or anything else that's becoming a fundamental part of our lives.
One stat I like is that people who generally picked up gaming in the last sort of 15, 20 years generally don't stop.
Something changed in the way that this medium is organized.
And more than that, it's not just play anymore, right?
You've heard some examples today, but people are earning an income playing games.
And not in the obvious ways.
Yes, there's e-sports, there's prizes, there's the opportunity to make money in a competitive way.
But there's also people earning incomes modding games, building content in them, doing art in them.
I mean, there's something at a scale akin to the Florentine Renaissance, happening on your kid's iPhone in your living room.
And it's being ignored.
Now, what's even more exciting for me is what's about to happen.
The metaphor I like to use, if you'd let me geek out for a moment, is the notion of a theater.
For the last 10 years, games have massively advanced the visual effects, the physical immersion, the front end of games.
But behind the scenes, the actual experiential reality of a game world has remained woefully limited.
I'll put that in perspective for a moment.
I could leave this theater right now, I could do some graffiti, get in a fight, fall in love.
I might actually do all of those things after this, but the point is that all of that would have consequence.
It would ripple through reality -- all of you could interact with that at the same time.
It would be persistent.
And those are very important qualities to what makes the real world real.
Now, behind the scenes in games, we've had a limit for a very long time.
And the limit is, behind the visuals, the actual information being exchanged between players or entities in a single game world has been deeply bounded by the fact that games mostly take place on a single server or a single machine.
Even The World of Warcraft is actually thousands of smaller worlds.
When you hear about concerts in Fortnite, you're actually hearing about thousands of small concerts.
You know, individual, as was said earlier today, campfires or couches.
There isn't really this possibility to bring it all together.
Let's take a moment to just really understand what that means.
When you look at a game, you might see this, beautiful visuals, all of these things happening in front of you.
But behind the scenes in an online game, this is what it looks like.
To a computer scientist, all you see is just a little bit of information being exchanged by a tiny handful of meaningful entities or objects.
You might be thinking, "I've played in an infinite world.
" Well it's more that you've played on a treadmill.
As you've been walking through that world, we've been cleverly causing the parts of it that you're not in to vanish, and the parts of it in front of you to appear.
A good trick, but not the basis for the revolution that I promised you in the beginning of this talk.
But the reality is, for those of you that are passionate gamers and might be excited about this, and for those of you that are afraid and may not be, all of that is about to change.
Because finally, the technology is in place to go well beyond the limits that we've previously seen.
Let's just take a moment to visualize that.
I'm talking about not individual little simulations but a massive possibility of huge networks of interaction.
Massive global events that can happen inside that.
Things that even in the real world become challenging to produce at that kind of scale.
And I know some of you are gamers, so I'm going to show you some footage of some things that I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to do, from some of our partners.
TED and me had a back-and-forth on this.
These are a few things that not many people have seen before, some new experiences powered by this type of technology. I'll just [take] a moment to show you some of this stuff.
This is a single game world with thousands of simultaneous people participating in a conflict.
It also has its own ecosystem, its own sense of predator and prey.
Every single object you see here is simulated in some way.
This is a game being built by one of the biggest companies in the world, NetEase, a huge Chinese company.
And they've made an assistant creative simulation where groups of players can cocreate together, across multiple devices, in a world that doesn't vanish when you're done.
It's a place to tell stories and have adventures.
Even the weather is simulated.
And that's kind of awesome.
And this is my personal favorite.
This is a group of people, pioneers in Berlin, a group called Klang Games, and they're completely insane, and they'll love me for saying that.
And they found a way to model, basically, an entire planet.
They're going to have a simulation with millions of non-player characters and players engaging.
They actually grabbed Lawrence Lessig to help understand the political ramifications of the world they're creating.
This is the sort of astounding set of experiences, well beyond what we might have imagined, that are now going to be possible.
And that's just the first step in this technology.
So if we step beyond that, what happens?
Well, computer science tends to be all exponential, once we crack the really hard problems.
And I'm pretty sure that very soon, we're going to be in a place where we can make this type of computational power look like nothing.
And when that happens, the opportunities . . . It's worth taking a moment to try to imagine what I'm talking about here.
Hundreds of thousands or millions of people being able to coinhabit the same space.
The last time any of us as a species had the opportunity to build or do something together with that may people was in antiquity.
And the circumstances were less than optimal, shall we say.
Mostly conflicts or building pyramids.
But if you bring together that many people, the kind of shared experience that can create . . . I think it exercises a social muscle in us that we've lost and forgotten.
If we can give each other worlds, experiences at scale where we can spend a meaningful amount of our time, we can change what it means to be an individual.
We can go beyond a single identity to a diverse set of personal identities.
The gender, the race, the personality traits you were born with might be something you want to experiment differently with.
We all are, inside, multiple people.
It's also about empathy.
But if we could coinhabit, co-experience things together, that undiminished by physical frailty or by lack of context, create opportunities together, that changes things, that bonds people in different ways.
I mean, statistically, at this moment in time, there are people who are on the opposite sides of a conflict, who have been matchmade together into a game and don't even know it.
A sense of, I think, how we need to face this new opportunity a little differently to some we have in the past.
It's so hypocritical for yet another technologist to stand up on stage and say, "The future will be great, technology will fix it.
This has got to be something we all own, we all cocreate.
So, my final plea is really to those engineers, those scientists, those artists in the audience today.
Let's engage, let's all engage, let's actually try to make this something that we shape in a positive way, rather than once again have be done to us.
Thank you. (Applause)Hello. My name is Herman, and I've always been struck by how the most important, impactful, tsunami-like changes to our culture and our society always come from those things that we least think are going to have that impact.
I mean, as a computer scientist, I remember when Facebook was just image-sharing in dorm rooms, and depending upon who you ask, it's now involved in toppling elections.
And I think each of you can recall that moment where one of these ideas felt like some ignorable, derisive thing, and suddenly, oh, crap, the price of Bitcoin is what it is.
I see some skeptical faces in the audience.
And the reality is that's a billion more than five years ago.
And more than that, it's not just play anymore, right?
The metaphor I like to use, if you'd let me geek out for a moment, is the notion of a theater.
But behind the scenes, the actual experiential reality of a game world has remained woefully limited.
Massive global events that can happen inside that.
This is a single game world with thousands of simultaneous people participating in a conflict.
This is a group of people, pioneers in Berlin, a group called Klang Games, and they're completely insane, and they'll love me for saying that.
And that's just the first step in this technology.
Mostly conflicts or building pyramids.
Not necessarily the best thing for us to be spending our time doing.
But if you bring together that many people, the kind of shared experience that can create . . . I think it exercises a social muscle in us that we've lost and forgotten.
Going even beyond that, I want to take a moment to think about what it means for relationships, for identity.
If we can give each other worlds, experiences at scale where we can spend a meaningful amount of our time, we can change what it means to be an individual.
We can go beyond a single identity to a diverse set of personal identities.
The gender, the race, the personality traits you were born with might be something you want to experiment differently with.
You might be someone that wants to be more than one person.
We all are, inside, multiple people.
We rarely get the opportunity to flex that.
It's also about empathy.
I have a grandmother who I have literally nothing in common with. I love her to bits, but every story she has begins in 1940 and ends sometime in 1950. And every story I have is like 50 years later.
But if we could coinhabit, co-experience things together, that undiminished by physical frailty or by lack of context, create opportunities together, that changes things, that bonds people in different ways.
I'm struck by how social media has amplified our many differences, and really made us more who we are in the presence of other people.
I think games could really start to create an opportunity for us to empathize again.
To have shared adversity, shared opportunity.
I mean, statistically, at this moment in time, there are people who are on the opposite sides of a conflict, who have been matchmade together into a game and don't even know it.
That's an incredible opportunity to change the way we look at things.
Finally, for those of you who perhaps are more cynical about all of this, who maybe don't think that virtual worlds and games are your cup of tea. There's a reality you have to accept, and that is that the economic impact of what I'm talking about will be profound.
Right now, thousands of people have full-time jobs in gaming.
Soon, it will be millions of people.
Wherever there's a mobile phone, there will be a job.
An opportunity for something that is creative and rich and gives you an income, no matter what country you're in, no matter what skills or opportunities you might think you have.
Probably the first dollar most kids born today make might be in a game.
That will be the new paper route, that will be the new opportunity for an income at the earliest time in your life.
So I kind of want to end with almost a plea, really, more than thoughts.
A sense of, I think, how we need to face this new opportunity a little differently to some we have in the past.
It's so hypocritical for yet another technologist to stand up on stage and say, "The future will be great, technology will fix it.
" And the reality is, this is going to have downsides.
But those downsides will only be amplified if we approach, once again, with cynicism and derision, the opportunities that this presents.
The worst thing that we could possibly do is let the same four or five companies end up dominating yet another adjacent space.
(Applause) Because they're not just going to define how and who makes money from this.
The reality is, we're now talking about defining how we think, what the rules are around identity and collaboration, the rules of the world we live in.
This has got to be something we all own, we all cocreate.
So, my final plea is really to those engineers, those scientists, those artists in the audience today.
Maybe some of you dreamed of working on space travel. The reality is, there are worlds you can build right here, right now, that can transform people's lives.
There are still huge technological frontiers that need to be overcome here, akin to those we faced when building the early internet.
All the technology behind virtual worlds is different.
So, my plea to you is this.
Let's engage, let's all engage, let's actually try to make this something that we shape in a positive way, rather than once again have be done to us.
Thank you. (Applause)
The Earth is 4.6 billion years old, but a human lifetime often lasts for less than 100 years.
So why care about the history of our planet when the distant past seems so inconsequential to everyday life?
You see, as far as we can tell, Earth is the only planet in our solar system known to have sparked life, and the only system able to provide life support for human beings.
So why Earth?
We know Earth is unique for having plate tectonics, liquid water on its surface and an oxygen-rich atmosphere.
But this has not always been the case, and we know this because ancient rocks have recorded the pivotal moments in Earth's planetary evolution.
And one of the best places to observe those ancient rocks is in the Pilbara of Western Australia.
The rocks here are 3.5 billion years old, and they contain some of the oldest evidence for life on the planet.
Now, often when we think of early life, we might imagine a stegosaurus or maybe a fish crawling onto land.
But the early life that I'm talking about is simple microscopic life, like bacteria.
And their fossils are often preserved as layered rock structures, called stromatolites.
This simple form of life is almost all we see in the fossil record for the first three billion years of life on Earth.
Our species can only be traced back in the fossil record to a few hundred thousand years ago.
We know from the fossil record, bacteria life had grabbed a strong foothold by about 3.5 to four billion years ago.
The rocks older than this have been either destroyed or highly deformed through plate tectonics.
So what remains a missing piece of the puzzle is exactly when and how life on Earth began.
Here again is that ancient volcanic landscape in the Pilbara.
Little did I know that our research here would provide another clue to that origin-of-life puzzle.
It was on my first field trip here, toward the end of a full, long week mapping project, that I came across something rather special.
Now, what probably looks like a bunch of wrinkly old rocks are actually stromatolites.
And at the center of this mound was a small, peculiar rock about the size of a child's hand.
It took six months before we inspected this rock under a microscope, when one of my mentors at the time, Malcolm Walter, suggested the rock resembled geyserite.
In 1871, in a letter to his friend Joseph Hooker, Charles Darwin suggested: "What if life started in some warm little pond with all sort of chemicals still ready to undergo more complex changes?
" Well, we know of warm little ponds. We call them "hot springs.
" In these environments, you have hot water dissolving minerals from the underlying rocks.
This one is located along the Tonga volcanic arc, 1,100 meters below sea level in the Pacific Ocean.
Eventually, it reached the age of the human, a species that has begun to question its own existence and the existence of life elsewhere: Is there a cosmic community waiting to connect with us, or are we all there is?
At about 2.5 billion years ago, there is evidence that bacteria had begun to produce oxygen, kind of like plants do today.
Geologists refer to the period that followed as the Great Oxidation Event.
And it produced the ozone layer, which protects modern life from the harmful effects of the sun's UVB radiation.
Today, we humans dig up fossilized complex life and burn it for fuel.
And the effects of those are encompassed by global warming.
If the rocks could talk, I suspect they might say this: life on Earth is precious.
You can use this information as a guide or a forecast -- or an explanation as to why it seems so lonely in this part of the galaxy.
So why care about the history of our planet when the distant past seems so inconsequential to everyday life?
Geyserite is a rock type that only forms in and around the edges of hot spring pools.
Now, in order for you to understand the significance of geyserite, I need to take you back a couple of centuries.
In 1871, in a letter to his friend Joseph Hooker, Charles Darwin suggested: "What if life started in some warm little pond with all sort of chemicals still ready to undergo more complex changes?
" Well, we know of warm little ponds. We call them "hot springs.
" In these environments, you have hot water dissolving minerals from the underlying rocks.
This solution mixes with organic compounds and results in a kind of chemical factory, which researchers have shown can manufacture simple cellular structures that are the first steps toward life.
But 100 years after Darwin's letter, deep-sea hydrothermal vents, or hot vents, were discovered in the ocean.
And these are also chemical factories.
This one is located along the Tonga volcanic arc, 1,100 meters below sea level in the Pacific Ocean.
The black smoke that you see billowing out of these chimneylike structures is also mineral-rich fluid, which is being fed off by bacteria.
And since the discovery of these deep-sea vents, the favored scenario for an origin of life has been in the ocean.
And this is for good reason: deep-sea vents are well-known in the ancient rock record, and it's thought that the early Earth had a global ocean and very little land surface.
So the probability that deep-sea vents were abundant on the very early Earth fits well with an origin of life in the ocean.
However . . . our research in the Pilbara provides and supports an alternative perspective.
After three years, finally, we were able to show that, in fact, our little rock was geyserite.
So this conclusion suggested not only did hot springs exist in our 3.5 billion-year-old volcano in the Pilbara, but it pushed back evidence for life living on land in hot springs in the geological record of Earth by three billion years.
And so, from a geological perspective, Darwin's warm little pond is a reasonable origin-of-life candidate.
Of course, it's still debatable how life began on Earth, and it probably always will be.
But it is clear that it's flourished; it has diversified, and it has become ever more complex.
Eventually, it reached the age of the human, a species that has begun to question its own existence and the existence of life elsewhere: Is there a cosmic community waiting to connect with us, or are we all there is?
A clue to this puzzle again comes from the ancient rock record.
At about 2.5 billion years ago, there is evidence that bacteria had begun to produce oxygen, kind of like plants do today.
Geologists refer to the period that followed as the Great Oxidation Event.
It is implied from rocks called banded iron formations, many of which can be observed as hundreds-of-meter-thick packages of rock which are exposed in gorges that carve their way through the Karijini National Park in Western Australia.
The arrival of free oxygen allowed two major changes to occur on our planet.
First, it allowed complex life to evolve.
You see, life needs oxygen to get big and complex.
And it produced the ozone layer, which protects modern life from the harmful effects of the sun's UVB radiation.
So in an ironic twist, microbial life made way for complex life, and in essence, relinquished its three-billion-year reign over the planet.
Today, we humans dig up fossilized complex life and burn it for fuel.
This practice pumps vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and like our microbial predecessors, we have begun to make substantial changes to our planet.
And the effects of those are encompassed by global warming.
Unfortunately, the ironic twist here could see the demise of humanity.
And so maybe the reason we aren't connecting with life elsewhere, intelligent life elsewhere, is that once it evolves, it extinguishes itself quickly.
If the rocks could talk, I suspect they might say this: life on Earth is precious.
It is the product of four or so billion years of a delicate and complex co-evolution between life and Earth, of which humans only represent the very last speck of time.
You can use this information as a guide or a forecast -- or an explanation as to why it seems so lonely in this part of the galaxy.
But use it to gain some perspective about the legacy that you want to leave behind on the planet that you call home.
Thank you.
(Applause)
A few years ago, I was taking care of a woman who was a victim of violence.
I wanted her to be seen in a clinic that specialized in trauma survivors.
I made the appointment myself because, being the director of the department, I knew if I did it, she would get an appointment right away.
For this reason, they don't generally allow the doctors to make appointments for the patients.They had made a special exception for me.
When I spoke to my patient, she had a much simpler and less Freudian explanation of why she didn't go to that appointment: her ride didn't show.
Now, some of you may be thinking, "Didn't she have some other way of getting to that clinic appointment?
" Couldn't she have taken an Uber or called another friend?
If you're thinking that, it's probably because you have resources. But she didn't have enough money for an Uber, and she didn't have another friend to call. But she did have me, and I was able to get her another appointment, which she kept without difficulty.
She wasn't resistant, it's just that her ride didn't show.
Health care in the United States assumes that, besides getting across the large land expanse of Los Angeles, it also assumes that you can take off from work in the middle of the day to get care.
One of the patients who came to my East Los Angeles clinic on a Thursday afternoon presented with partial blindness in both eyes.
Very concerned, I said to him, "When did this develop?
" He said, "Sunday.
" I said, "Sunday?
Did you think of coming sooner to clinic?
" And he said, "Well, I have to work in order to pay the rent.
" A second patient to that same clinic, a trucker, drove three days with a raging infection, only coming to see me after he had delivered his merchandise. Both patients' care was jeopardized by their delays in seeking care.
Health care in the United States assumes that you speak English or can bring someone with you who can.
In San Francisco, I took care of a patient on the inpatient service who was from West Africa and spoke a dialect so unusual that we could only find one translator on the telephonic line who could understand him. And that translator only worked one afternoon a week.
Unfortunately, my patient needed translation services every day.
Health care in the United States assumes that you are literate.
I learned that a patient of mine who spoke English without accent was illiterate, when he asked me to please sign a social security disability form for him right away.
The form needed to go to the office that same day, and I wasn't in clinic, so trying to help him out, knowing that he was the sole caretaker of his son, I said, "Well, bring the form to my administrative office.
I'll sign it and I'll fax it in for you.
" He took the two buses to my office, dropped off the form, went back home to take care of his son . . . I got to the office, and what did I find next to the big "X" on the form?
The word "applicant.
" He needed to sign the form.
And so now I had to have him take the two buses back to the office and sign the form so that we could then fax it in for him.
It completely changed how I took care of him.
I made sure that I always went over instructions verbally with him.
It also made me think about all of the patients who receive reams and reams of paper spit out by our modern electronic health record systems, explaining their diagnoses and their treatments, and wondering how many people actually can understand what's on those pieces of paper.
Health care in the United States assumes that you have a working telephone and an accurate address.
The proliferation of inexpensive cell phones has actually helped quite a lot.
But still, my patients run out of minutes, and their phones get disconnected.
Low-income people often have to move around a lot by necessity.
I remember reviewing a chart of a woman with an abnormality on her mammogram.
That chart assiduously documents that three letters were sent to her home, asking her to please come in for follow-up.
Of course, if the address isn't accurate, it doesn't much matter how many letters you send to that same address.
Health care in the United States assumes that you have a steady supply of food.
This is particularly an issue for diabetics.
We give them medications that lower their blood sugar.
On days when they don't have enough food, it puts them at risk for a life-threatening side effect of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.
Health care in the United States assumes that you have a home with a refrigerator for your insulin, a bathroom where you can wash up, a bed where you can sleep without worrying about violence while you're resting.
But what if you don't have that?
What if you live on the street, you live under the freeway, you live in a congregant shelter, where every morning you have to leave at 7 or 8am?
Where do you store your medicines?
Where do you use the bathroom?
How do you put your legs up if you have congestive heart failure?
Is it any wonder that providing people with health insurance who are homeless does not erase the huge disparity between the homeless and the housed?
Health care in the United States assumes that you prioritize your health care.
But what about all of you?
Let me assume for a moment that you're all taking a medication.
Maybe it's for high blood pressure.
Maybe it's for diabetes or depression.
What if tonight you had a choice: you could have your medication but live on the street, or you could be housed in your home but not have your medication.
Which would you choose?
I know which one I would choose.
This is just a graphic example of the kinds of choices that low-income patients have to make every day.
So when my doctors shake their heads and say, "I don't know why that patient didn't keep his follow-up appointments," "I don't know why she didn't go for that exam that I ordered," I think, well, maybe her ride didn't show, or maybe he had to work.
But also, maybe there was something more important that day than their high blood pressure or a screening colonoscopy.
Maybe that patient was dealing with an abusive spouse or a daughter who is pregnant and drug-addicted or a son who was kicked out of school.
Or even maybe they were riding their bicycle through an intersection and got hit by a truck, and now they're using a wheelchair and have very limited mobility.
That's not true for low-income people.
They've seen their friends and relatives die young of accidents, of violence, of cancers that should have been diagnosed at an earlier stage. It can lead to a sense of hopelessness, that it doesn't really matter what you do.
I know I've painted a bleak picture of the care of low-income patients.
The starting point has to be to meet patients where they are, provide services without obstacles and provide patients what they need -- not what we think they need.
It's impossible for me to take good care of a patient who is homeless and living on the street.
The right prescription for a homeless patient is housing.
When we housed them, we found that overall health care costs, including the housing, decreased. That's because they had many fewer hospital visits, both in the emergency room and on the inpatient service.
And we gave them back their dignity.
For people who do not have a steady supply of food, especially those who are diabetic, safety net systems are experimenting with a variety of solutions, including food pantries at primary care clinics and distributing maps of community food banks and soup kitchens.
And in New York City, we've hired a bunch of enrollers to get our patients into the supplemental nutrition program known as "food stamps" to most people.
When patients and doctors don't understand each other, mistakes will occur.
For non-English-speaking patients, translation is as important as a prescription pad.
But low-income people really need a team of people who can help them to access the medical and non-medical services that they need.
But I didn't know that in another part of our clinic, on a different floor, there was a registration clerk who had developed a very special relationship with my patient every time he came in for an appointment.
My patient had a hard life.
It will speak their language, it will meet their schedules, it will fulfill their needs.
Thank you.
I made the appointment myself because, being the director of the department, I knew if I did it, she would get an appointment right away.
For this reason, they don't generally allow the doctors to make appointments for the patients.They had made a special exception for me.
If you're thinking that, it's probably because you have resources. But she didn't have enough money for an Uber, and she didn't have another friend to call. But she did have me, and I was able to get her another appointment, which she kept without difficulty.
It also made me think about all of the patients who receive reams and reams of paper spit out by our modern electronic health record systems, explaining their diagnoses and their treatments, and wondering how many people actually can understand what's on those pieces of paper.
But what if you don't have that?
Let me assume for a moment that you're all taking a medication.
So when my doctors shake their heads and say, "I don't know why that patient didn't keep his follow-up appointments," "I don't know why she didn't go for that exam that I ordered," I think, well, maybe her ride didn't show, or maybe he had to work.
Or even maybe they were riding their bicycle through an intersection and got hit by a truck, and now they're using a wheelchair and have very limited mobility.
Obviously, these things also happen to middle-class people. But when they do, we have resources that enable us to deal with these problems.
We also have the belief that we will live out our normal lifespans.
That's not true for low-income people.
They've seen their friends and relatives die young of accidents, of violence, of cancers that should have been diagnosed at an earlier stage. It can lead to a sense of hopelessness, that it doesn't really matter what you do.
I know I've painted a bleak picture of the care of low-income patients.
But I want you to know how rewarding I find it to work in a safety net system, and my deep belief is that we can make the system responsive to the needs of low-income patients.
The starting point has to be to meet patients where they are, provide services without obstacles and provide patients what they need -- not what we think they need.
It's impossible for me to take good care of a patient who is homeless and living on the street.
The right prescription for a homeless patient is housing.
In Los Angeles, we housed 4,700 chronically homeless persons suffering from medical illness, mental illness, addiction.
When we housed them, we found that overall health care costs, including the housing, decreased. That's because they had many fewer hospital visits, both in the emergency room and on the inpatient service.
And we gave them back their dignity.
No extra charge for that.
For people who do not have a steady supply of food, especially those who are diabetic, safety net systems are experimenting with a variety of solutions, including food pantries at primary care clinics and distributing maps of community food banks and soup kitchens.
And in New York City, we've hired a bunch of enrollers to get our patients into the supplemental nutrition program known as "food stamps" to most people.
When patients and doctors don't understand each other, mistakes will occur.
For non-English-speaking patients, translation is as important as a prescription pad.
Perhaps more important.
And, you know, it doesn't cost anything more to put all of the materials at the level of fourth-grade reading, so that everybody can understand what's being said. But more than anything else, I think low-income patients benefit from having a primary care doctor.
Mind you, I think middle-class people also benefit from having somebody to quarterback their care.
But when they don't, they have others who can advocate for them, who can get them that disability placard or make sure the disability application is completed.
But low-income people really need a team of people who can help them to access the medical and non-medical services that they need.
This was really brought home to me when one of my own long-term patients died at an outside hospital. I had to tell the other doctors and nurses in my clinic that he had passed.
But I didn't know that in another part of our clinic, on a different floor, there was a registration clerk who had developed a very special relationship with my patient every time he came in for an appointment.
When she learned three weeks later that he had died, she came and found me in my examining room, tears streaming down her cheeks, talking about my patient and the memories that she had of him, the kinds of discussions that they had had about their lives together.
My patient had a hard life.
He was by his own admission a gangbanger.
He had spent a substantial amount of time in prison.
He suffered from a very serious illness.
He was a drug addict.
But despite all that, he rarely missed a visit, and I like to believe that was because he knew at our clinic that he was loved.
When our health care systems have the same commitment to low-income patients that that man had to us, two things will happen.
First, the system will be responsive to the needs of low-income people.
It will speak their language, it will meet their schedules, it will fulfill their needs.
Second, we will be providing the kind of care that we went into this profession to do -- not just checking the boxes, but really taking care of those we serve.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Sounds cool, doesn't it?
Some people may have no idea what that means.
But I'm sure you've all heard about Cecil the lion.
[Cecil the Lion (2002-2015)] (Lion roaring) He roars no more.
On the second of July, 2015, his life was cut short when he was killed by a trophy hunter.
They say that you can become attached to the animals you study.
That was the case for me with Cecil the lion, having known him and studied him for three years in Hwange National Park.
I was heartbroken at his death.
But the good thing to come out of this tragedy is the attention that the story brought towards the plight of threatened wild animals.
After Cecil's death, I began to ask myself these questions: What if the community that lived next to Cecil the lion was involved in protecting him?
What if I had met Cecil when I was 10 years old, instead of 29? Could I or my classmates have changed his fate?
Many people are working to stop lions from disappearing, but very few of these people are native to these countries or from the communities most affected.
But the communities that live with the lions are the ones best positioned to help lions the most.
Local people should be at the forefront of the solutions to the challenges facing their wildlife.
Sometimes, change can only come when the people most affected and impacted take charge.
Local communities play an important role in fighting poaching and illegal wildlife trade, which are major threats affecting lions and other wildlife.
This is quite common in Zimbabwe, as many people are not exposed to wildlife, even though it's part of our heritage.
When I was growing up, I didn't even know that lions lived in my backyard.
When I stepped into Savé Valley Conservancy on a cold winter morning 10 years ago to study African wild dogs for my master's research project, I was mesmerized by the beauty and the tranquility that surrounded me. I felt like I had found my passion and my purpose in life.
I made a commitment that day that I was going to dedicate my life to protecting animals.
I think of my childhood school days in Zimbabwe and the other kids I was in school with.
Perhaps if we had a chance to interact with wildlife, more of my classmates would be working alongside me now. Unless the local communities want to protect and coexist with wildlife, all conservation efforts might be in vain.
These are the communities that live with the wild animals in the same ecosystem and bear the cost of doing so.
If they don't have a direct connection or benefit from the animals, they have no reason to want to protect them.
And if local communities don't protect their wildlife, no amount of outside intervention will work.
So what needs to be done?
Conservationists must prioritize environmental education and help expand the community's skills to conserve their wildlife.
Schoolchildren and communities must be taken to national parks, so they get a chance to connect with the wildlife. At every effort and every level, conservation must include the economies of the people who share the land with the wild animals.
It is also critical that local conservationists be part of every conservation effort, if we are to build trust and really embed conservation into communities.
As local conservationists, we face many hurdles, from outright discrimination to barriers because of cultural norms.
But I will not give up my efforts to bring indigenous communities to this fight for the survival of our planet.
I'm asking you to come and stand together with me.
We must actively dismantle the hurdles we have created, which are leaving indigenous populations out of conservation efforts.
I've dedicated my life to protecting lions.
And I know my neighbor would, too, if only they knew the animals that lived next door to them.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It's been about a decade since the last financial crisis, yet this industry has never been bigger.
Legislation that was meant to better regulate its largest players has hurt its smaller ones, resulting in most of the industry's assets to be controlled by the top one percent.
They've become too big to fail.
Our farmers, who feed our communities, cannot afford the very foods they grow.
Today, a handful of corporations continue to consolidate the entire food supply chain, from the intellectual property of seeds to produce and livestock all the way to the financial institutions who lend to these farmers.
And the recent results have been rising bankruptcies for family farms and little control for those who are just trying to survive in the industry.
Left unchecked, we will head into another economic collapse, one very similar to the farm crisis of the 1980s, when commodity market prices crashed, interest rates doubled, and many farmers lost everything.
Fortunately, there's a very simple, three-part solution you can be part of right now to help us transform our food industry from the bottom up.
Step one: shop at your local farmers markets.
Buying from your local market and subscribing to a community-supported agricultural produce box, better known as a CSA, may be the single greatest purchasing decision you can make as a consumer today.
Last year, American farmers made the least they have in almost three decades, because they now own fewer parts of the supply chain than ever before.
Under exclusive contracts with Big Ag and big box stores, farmers are not offered a fair price for their goods.
In fact, the average farmer in America makes less than 15 cents of every dollar on a product that you purchase at a store.
On the other hand, farmers who sell their goods at a farmers market take home closer to 90 cents of every dollar.
But beyond taking home a larger share, farmers use markets as an opportunity to cultivate the next generation of agriculturalists who shepherd our farmlands and our pastures.
In our fight against climate change, we need them now more than ever to promote and preserve diverse land use.
When multigenerational farms are lost to Big Ag consolidation, our communities suffer in countless ways.
Rural America has now jumped above the national average in violent crime.
Three out four farmworkers surveyed have been directly impacted by our opioid epidemic.
Now oftentimes disguised as accidents, farmer suicide is now on the rise.
Step two: shop at your local farmers markets.
(Laughter) Produce from a large retail store is harvested before it's ripe to travel more than a thousand miles before it ultimately sits on your shelf roughly two weeks later.
Alternatively, because most farmers markets have proximity and production requirements, farmers travel less than 50 miles to offer you local produce with minimal packaging waste.
With the advent of online grocers and trending meal kits, consumers are increasingly disconnected with their farmers and the economics of food production.
Since the rise of the smartphone revolution, direct-to-consumer goods have stagnated.
While local and sustainable foods have been trending for almost a decade, terms like "healthy" and "natural" have no legal framework in the United States.
Your best bet for fresh, nutrient-rich foods without the marketing jargon?
Go to your farmers market.
Buying local is not a new idea, but turning it into a habit in today's world still is.
If we want to avoid the high costs of cheap food, protect our environment, rebuild our communities and save our farmers -- literally -- we're going to need to vote with our food purchases.
The success of our food systems is directly attached to us.
If we want to break up Big Ag's hold on our food supply chain, then we're going to need to connect with our farmers.
We're going to need to rebuild relationships with the hands that feed us three times a day.
Plus, two more for snacks.
Come on.
With a government online database of more than 8,600 farmers markets across the country, you can easily find the nearest one to you.
Just think of yourself as an investor in food, where your purchasing power helps create a more equitable society for everyone.
Oh!
Almost forgot step three, which may surprise you: shop at your local farmers markets.
(Laughter) Thank you. (Applause)
People use the internet for various reasons.
It turns out that one of the most popular categories of website is something that people typically consume in private.
It involves curiosity, non-insignificant levels of self-indulgence and is centered around recording the reproductive activities of other people.
(Laughter) Of course, I'm talking about genealogy -- (Laughter) the study of family history.
When it comes to detailing family history, in every family, we have this person that is obsessed with genealogy.
Let's call him Uncle Bernie.
Uncle Bernie is exactly the last person you want to sit next to in Thanksgiving dinner, because he will bore you to death with peculiar details about some ancient relatives.
But as you know, there is a scientific side for everything, and we found that Uncle Bernie's stories have immense potential for biomedical research.
We let Uncle Bernie and his fellow genealogists document their family trees through a genealogy website called geni. com. When users upload their trees to the website, it scans their relatives, and if it finds matches to existing trees, it merges the existing and the new tree together.
The result is that large family trees are created, beyond the individual level of each genealogist.
Now, by repeating this process with millions of people all over the world, we can crowdsource the construction of a family tree of all humankind.
Using this website, we were able to connect 125 million people into a single family tree.
I cannot draw the tree on the screens over here because they have less pixels than the number of people in this tree.
But here is an example of a subset of 6,000 individuals.
Each green node is a person.
The red nodes represent marriages, and the connections represent parenthood.
In the middle of this tree, you see the ancestors.
And as we go to the periphery, you see the descendants.
This tree has seven generations, approximately.
Now, this is what happens when we increase the number of individuals to 70,000 people -- still a tiny subset of all the data that we have.
Despite that, you can already see the formation of gigantic family trees with many very distant relatives.
Thanks to the hard work of our genealogists, we can go back in time hundreds of years ago.
For example, here is Alexander Hamilton, who was born in 1755. Alexander was the first US Secretary of the Treasury, but mostly known today due to a popular Broadway musical.
We found that Alexander has deeper connections in the showbiz industry.
In fact, he's a blood relative of . . . Kevin Bacon!
(Laughter) Both of them are descendants of a lady from Scotland who lived in the 13th century.
So you can say that Alexander Hamilton is 35 degrees of Kevin Bacon genealogy.
(Laughter) And our tree has millions of stories like that.
We invested significant efforts to validate the quality of our data.
Using DNA, we found that . 3 percent of the mother-child connections in our data are wrong, which could match the adoption rate in the US pre-Second World War.
For the father's side, the news is not as good: 1.9 percent of the father-child connections in our data are wrong.
And I see some people smirk over here. It is what you think -- there are many milkmen out there.
(Laughter) However, this 1.9 percent error rate in patrilineal connections is not unique to our data.
Previous studies found a similar error rate using clinical-grade pedigrees.
So the quality of our data is good, and that should not be a surprise.
Our genealogists have a profound, vested interest in correctly documenting their family history.
We can leverage this data to learn quantitative information about humanity, for example, questions about demography.
Here is a look at all our profiles on the map of the world.
Each pixel is a person that lived at some point.
And since we have so much data, you can see the contours of many countries, especially in the Western world.
In this clip, we stratified the map that I've showed you based on the year of births of individuals from 1400 to 1900, and we compared it to known migration events.
The clip is going to show you that the deepest lineages in our data go all the way back to the UK, where they had better record keeping, and then they spread along the routes of Western colonialism.
Let's watch this.
(Music) [Year of birth: ] [1492 - Columbus sails the ocean blue] [1620 - Mayflower lands in Massachusetts] [1652 - Dutch settle in South Africa] [1788 - Great Britain penal transportation to Australia starts] [1836 - First migrants use Oregon Trail] [all activity] I love this movie.
Now, since these migration events are giving the context of families, we can ask questions such as: What is the typical distance between the birth locations of husbands and wives?
This distance plays a pivotal role in demography, because the patterns in which people migrate to form families determine how genes spread in geographical areas.
We analyzed this distance using our data, and we found that in the old days, people had it easy.
And today, with affordable flights and online social media, people typically migrate more than 100 kilometers from their place of birth to find their soul mate.
So now you might ask: OK, but who does the hard work of migrating from places to places to form families?
Are these the males or the females?
We used our data to address this question, and at least in the last 300 years, we found that the ladies do the hard work of migrating from places to places to form families.
Now, these results are statistically significant, so you can take it as scientific fact that males are lazy.
(Laughter) We can move from questions about demography and ask questions about human health.
For example, we can ask to what extent genetic variations account for differences in life span between individuals. Previous studies analyzed the correlation of longevity between twins to address this question.
They estimated that the genetic variations account for about a quarter of the differences in life span between individuals.
But twins can be correlated due to so many reasons, including various environmental effects or a shared household.
Large family trees give us the opportunity to analyze both close relatives, such as twins, all the way to distant relatives, even fourth cousins.
This way we can build robust models that can tease apart the contribution of genetic variations from environmental factors.
We conducted this analysis using our data, and we found that genetic variations explain only 15 percent of the differences in life span between individuals.
That is five years, on average.
So genes matter less than what we thought before to life span.
And I find it great news, because it means that our actions can matter more.
Smoking, for example, determines 10 years of our life expectancy -- twice as much as what genetics determines.
We can even have more surprising findings as we move from family trees and we let our genealogists document and crowdsource DNA information.
And the results can be amazing.
It might be hard to imagine, but Uncle Bernie and his friends can create DNA forensic capabilities that even exceed what the FBI currently has.
When you place the DNA on a large family tree, you effectively create a beacon that illuminates the hundreds of distant relatives that are all connected to the person that originated the DNA.
By placing multiple beacons on a large family tree, you can now triangulate the DNA of an unknown person, the same way that the GPS system uses multiple satellites to find a location.
The prime example of the power of this technique is capturing the Golden State Killer, one of the most notorious criminals in the history of the US.
The FBI had been searching for this person for over 40 years.
They had his DNA, but he never showed up in any police database.
About a year ago, the FBI consulted a genetic genealogist, and she suggested that they submit his DNA to a genealogy service that can locate distant relatives.
They did that, and they found a third cousin of the Golden State Killer.
They built a large family tree, scanned the different branches of that tree, until they found a profile that exactly matched what they knew about the Golden State Killer.
They obtained DNA from this person and found a perfect match to the DNA they had in hand.
They arrested him and brought him to justice after all these years.
Since then, genetic genealogists have started working with local US law enforcement agencies to use this technique in order to capture criminals.
And only in the past six months, they were able to solve over 20 cold cases with this technique.
Luckily, we have people like Uncle Bernie and his fellow genealogists These are not amateurs with a self-serving hobby.
These are citizen scientists with a deep passion to tell us who we are.
And they know that the past can hold a key to the future.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The world today has many problems.
And they're all very complicated and interconnected and difficult.
But there is something we can do.
I believe that girls' education is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet to help solve some of the world's most difficult problems.
But you don't have to take my word for it.
The World Bank says that girls' education is one of the best investments that a country can make.
It helps to positively impact nine of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
Everything from health, nutrition, employment -- all of these are positively impacted when girls are educated.
Additionally, climate scientists have recently rated girls' education at number six out of 80 actions to reverse global warming.
At number six, it's rated higher than solar panels and electric cars.
And that's because when girls are educated, they have smaller families, and the resulting reduction in population reduces carbon emissions significantly.
But more than that, you know, it's a problem we have to solve once.
Because an educated mother is more than twice as likely to educate her children.
Which means that by doing it once, we can close the gender and literacy gap forever.
I work in India, which has made incredible progress in bringing elementary education for all.
However, we still have four million out-of-school girls, one of the highest in the world.
And girls are out of school because of, obviously poverty, social, cultural factors.
But there's also this underlying factor of mindset.
I have met a girl whose name was Naraaz Nath.
Naaraaz means angry.
And when I asked her, "Why is your name 'angry'?
" she said, "Because everybody was so angry when a girl was born.
" Another girl called Antim Bala, which means the last girl.
Because everybody hoped that would be the last girl to be born.
A girl called Aachuki.
It means somebody who has arrived.
Not wanted, but arrived.
And it is this mindset that keeps girls from school or completing their education.
It's this belief that a goat is an asset and a girl is a liability.
My organization Educate Girls works to change this.
And we work in some of the most difficult, rural, remote and tribal villages.
And how do we do it?
We first and foremost find young, passionate, educated youth from the same villages.
Both men and women.
And we call them Team Balika, balika just means the girl child, so this is a team that we are creating for the girl child.
And so once we recruit our community volunteers, we train them, we mentor them, we hand-hold them.
That's when our work starts.
And the first piece we do is about identifying every single girl who's not going to school.
But the way we do it is a little different and high-tech, at least in my view.
Each of our frontline staff have a smartphone.
It has its own Educate Girls app.
And this app has everything that our team needs.
It has digital maps of where they're going to be conducting the survey, it has the survey in it, all the questions, little guides on how best to conduct the survey, so that the data that comes to us is in real time and is of good quality.
So armed with this, our teams and our volunteers go door-to-door to every single household to find every single girl who may either we never enrolled or dropped out of school.
And because we have this data and technology piece, very quickly we can figure out who the girls are and where they are.
Because each of our villages are geotagged, and we can actually build that information out very, very quickly.
And so once we know where the girls are, we actually start the process of bringing them back into school.
And that actually is just our community mobilization process, it starts with village meetings, neighborhood meetings, and as you see, individual counseling of parents and families, to be able to bring the girls back into school. And this can take anything from a few weeks to a few months.
And once we bring the girls into the school system, we also work with the schools to make sure that schools have all the basic infrastructure so that the girls will be able to stay.
And this would include a separate toilet for girls, drinking water, things that will help them to be retained.
But all of this would be useless if our children weren't learning.
So we actually run a learning program.
And this is a supplementary learning program, and it's very, very important, because most of our children are first-generation learners.
That means there's nobody at home to help them with homework, there's nobody who can support their education.
Their parents can't read and write.
And we know this because a most recent randomized control evaluation confirms its efficacy.
Our evaluator found that over a three-year period Educate Girls was able to bring back 92 percent of all out-of-school girls back into school.
(Applause) And in terms of learning, our children's learning went up significantly as compared to control schools.
So much so, that it was like an additional year of schooling for the average student.
And that's enormous, when you think about a tribal child who's entering the school system for the first time.
So here we have a model that works; we know it's scalable, because we are already functioning at 13,000 villages.
We know it's smart, because of the use of data and technology.
We know that it's sustainable and systemic, because we work in partnership with the community, it's actually led by the community.
And we work in partnership with the government, so there's no creation of a parallel delivery system.
And so because we have this innovative partnership with the community, the government, this smart model, we have this big, audacious dream today.
And that is to solve a full 40 percent of the problem of out-of-school girls in India in the next five years.
(Applause) And you're thinking, that's a little . . . You know, how am I even thinking about doing that, because India is not a small place, it's a huge country.
It's a country of over a billion people.
We have 650,000 villages.
How is it that I'm standing here, saying that one small organization is going to solve a full 40 percent of the problem?
And that's because we have a key insight.
And that is, because of our entire approach, with data and with technology, that five percent of villages in India have 40 percent of the out-of-school girls.
And this is a big, big piece of the puzzle.
Which means, I don't have to work across the entire country.
I have to work in those five percent of the villages, about 35,000 villages, to actually be able to solve a large piece of the problem.
And that's really key, because these villages not only have high burden of out-of-school girls, but also a lot of related indicators, right, like malnutrition, stunting, poverty, infant mortality, child marriage.
So by working and focusing here, you can actually create a large multiplier effect across all of these indicators.
And it would mean that we would be able to bring back 1.6 million girls back into school.
" Every single girl I meet wants to go to school.
And that's what we really want to do.
We want to be able to fulfill those 1.6 million dreams.
And it doesn't take much.
To find and enroll a girl with our model is about 20 dollars.
To make sure that she is learning and providing a learning program, it's another 40 dollars.
But today is the time to do it.
Because she is truly the biggest asset we have.
I am Safeena Husain, and I educate girls.
Thank you.
(Applause)
For a really long time, I had two mysteries that were hanging over me.
I didn't understand them and, to be honest, I was quite afraid to look into them.
The first mystery was, I'm 40 years old, and all throughout my lifetime, year after year, serious depression and anxiety have risen, in the United States, in Britain, and across the Western world.
And I wanted to understand why.
Why is this happening to us?
Why is it that with each year that passes, more and more of us are finding it harder to get through the day?
And I wanted to understand this because of a more personal mystery.
When I was a teenager, I remember going to my doctor and explaining that I had this feeling, like pain was leaking out of me.
I couldn't control it, I didn't understand why it was happening, I felt quite ashamed of it.
And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was well-intentioned, but quite oversimplified.
Not totally wrong.
My doctor said, "We know why people get like this.
Some people just naturally get a chemical imbalance in their heads -- you're clearly one of them.
All we need to do is give you some drugs, it will get your chemical balance back to normal.
" So I started taking a drug called Paxil or Seroxat, it's the same thing with different names in different countries.
And I felt much better, I got a real boost.
But not very long afterwards, this feeling of pain started to come back.
So I was given higher and higher doses until, for 13 years, I was taking the maximum possible dose that you're legally allowed to take.
And for a lot of those 13 years, and pretty much all the time by the end, I was still in a lot of pain.
And I started asking myself, "What's going on here?
Because you're doing everything you're told to do by the story that's dominating the culture -- why do you still feel like this?
" So to get to the bottom of these two mysteries, for a book that I've written I ended up going on a big journey all over the world, I traveled over 40,000 miles.
I wanted to sit with the leading experts in the world about what causes depression and anxiety and crucially, what solves them, and people who have come through depression and anxiety and out the other side in all sorts of ways.
And I learned a huge amount from the amazing people I got to know along the way.
But I think at the heart of what I learned is, so far, we have scientific evidence for nine different causes of depression and anxiety.
Two of them are indeed in our biology.
Your genes can make you more sensitive to these problems, though they don't write your destiny.
And there are real brain changes that can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out.
But most of the factors that have been proven to cause depression and anxiety are not in our biology.
They are factors in the way we live.
And once you understand them, it opens up a very different set of solutions that should be offered to people alongside the option of chemical antidepressants.
For example, if you're lonely, you're more likely to become depressed.
If, when you go to work, you don't have any control over your job, you've just got to do what you're told, you're more likely to become depressed.
If you very rarely get out into the natural world, you're more likely to become depressed.
And one thing unites a lot of the causes of depression and anxiety that I learned about.
Not all of them, but a lot of them.
Everyone here knows you've all got natural physical needs, right? Obviously. You need food, you need water, you need shelter, you need clean air.
If I took those things away from you, you'd all be in real trouble, real fast.
But at the same time, every human being has natural psychological needs.
You need to feel you belong.
You need to feel your life has meaning and purpose.
You need to feel that people see you and value you.
You need to feel you've got a future that makes sense.
And this culture we built is good at lots of things.
And many things are better than in the past -- I'm glad to be alive today.
But we've been getting less and less good at meeting these deep, underlying psychological needs.
And it's not the only thing that's going on, but I think it's the key reason why this crisis keeps rising and rising.
And I found this really hard to absorb.
I really wrestled with the idea of shifting from thinking of my depression as just a problem in my brain, to one with many causes, including many in the way we're living.
And it only really began to fall into place for me when one day, I went to interview a South African psychiatrist named Dr. Derek Summerfield.
He's a great guy.
And Dr. Summerfield happened to be in Cambodia in 2001, when they first introduced chemical antidepressants for people in that country.
And the local doctors, the Cambodians, had never heard of these drugs, so they were like, what are they?
And he explained.
And they said to him, "We don't need them, we've already got antidepressants. " And he was like, "What do you mean?
" He thought they were going to talk about some kind of herbal remedy, like St.
John's Wort, ginkgo biloba, something like that.
Instead, they told him a story.
There was a farmer in their community who worked in the rice fields.
And one day, he stood on a land mine left over from the war with the United States, and he got his leg blown off. So they him an artificial leg, and after a while, he went back to work in the rice fields.
But apparently, it's super painful to work under water when you've got an artificial limb, and I'm guessing it was pretty traumatic to go back and work in the field where he got blown up.
The guy started to cry all day, he refused to get out of bed, he developed all the symptoms of classic depression.
The Cambodian doctor said, "This is when we gave him an antidepressant.
" And Dr. Summerfield said, "What was it?
" They explained that they went and sat with him.
They listened to him.
They realized that his pain made sense -- it was hard for him to see it in the throes of his depression, but actually, it had perfectly understandable causes in his life.
" So they bought him a cow.
Within a couple of weeks, his crying stopped, within a month, his depression was gone.
They said to doctor Summerfield, "So you see, doctor, that cow, that was an antidepressant, that's what you mean, right?
" (Laughter) (Applause) If you'd been raised to think about depression the way I was, and most of the people here were, that sounds like a bad joke, right?
"I went to my doctor for an antidepressant, she gave me a cow.
" But what those Cambodian doctors knew intuitively, based on this individual, unscientific anecdote, is what the leading medical body in the world, the World Health Organization, has been trying to tell us for years, based on the best scientific evidence.
If you're depressed, if you're anxious, you're not weak, you're not crazy, you're not, in the main, a machine with broken parts.
You're a human being with unmet needs.
And it's just as important to think here about what those Cambodian doctors and the World Health Organization are not saying.
They did not say to this farmer, "Hey, buddy, you need to pull yourself together.
It's your job to figure out and fix this problem on your own.
" On the contrary, what they said is, "We're here as a group to pull together with you, so together, we can figure out and fix this problem.
" This is what every depressed person needs, and it's what every depressed person deserves.
This is why one of the leading doctors at the United Nations, in their official statement for World Health Day, couple of years back in 2017, said we need to talk less about chemical imbalances and more about the imbalances in the way we live.
Drugs give real relief to some people -- they gave relief to me for a while -- but precisely because this problem goes deeper than their biology, the solutions need to go much deeper, too.
But when I first learned that, I remember thinking, "OK, I could see all the scientific evidence, I read a huge number of studies, I interviewed a huge number of the experts who were explaining this," but I kept thinking, "How can we possibly do that?
" The things that are making us depressed are in most cases more complex than what was going on with this Cambodian farmer.
Where do we even begin with that insight?
But then, in the long journey for my book, all over the world, I kept meeting people who were doing exactly that, from Sydney, to San Francisco, to São Paulo.
I kept meeting people who were understanding the deeper causes of depression and anxiety and, as groups, fixing them.
Obviously, I can't tell you about all the amazing people I got to know and wrote about, or all of the nine causes of depression and anxiety that I learned about, because they won't let me give a 10-hour TED Talk -- you can complain about that to them.
But I want to focus on two of the causes and two of the solutions that emerge from them, if that's alright. Here's the first.
We are the loneliest society in human history.
There was a recent study that asked Americans, "Do you feel like you're no longer close to anyone?
" And 39 percent of people said that described them.
"No longer close to anyone.
Why are we here, why are we alive?
" One key reason is that our ancestors on the savannas of Africa were really good at one thing.
They weren't bigger than the animals they took down a lot of the time, they weren't faster than the animals they took down a lot of the time, but they were much better at banding together into groups and cooperating.
This was our superpower as a species -- we band together, just like bees evolved to live in a hive, humans evolved to live in a tribe.
And we are the first humans ever to disband our tribes.
And it is making us feel awful.
But it doesn't have to be this way.
One of the heroes in my book, and in fact, in my life, is a doctor named Sam Everington.
He's a general practitioner in a poor part of East London, where I lived for many years.
And Sam was really uncomfortable, because he had loads of patients coming to him with terrible depression and anxiety.
And like me, he's not opposed to chemical antidepressants, he thinks they give some relief to some people.
But he could see two things.
Firstly, his patients were depressed and anxious a lot of the time for totally understandable reasons, like loneliness.
And secondly, although the drugs were giving some relief to some people, for many people, they didn't solve the problem.
The underlying problem.
One day, Sam decided to pioneer a different approach.
A woman came to his center, his medical center, called Lisa Cunningham.
I got to know Lisa later.
And Lisa had been shut away in her home with crippling depression and anxiety for seven years.
And when she came to Sam's center, she was told, "Don't worry, we'll carry on giving you these drugs, but we're also going to prescribe something else.
" The first time this group met, Lisa literally started vomiting with anxiety, it was so overwhelming for her.
But people rubbed her back, the group started talking, they were like, "What could we do?
" These are inner-city, East London people like me, they didn't know anything about gardening.
They were like, "Why don't we learn gardening?
" There was an area behind the doctors' offices that was just scrubland.
"Why don't we make this into a garden?
" They started to take books out of the library, started to watch YouTube clips.
They started to get their fingers in the soil.
They started to learn the rhythms of the seasons.
There's a lot of evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful antidepressant.
But they started to do something even more important.
They started to form a tribe. They started to form a group.
They started to care about each other.
If one of them didn't show up, the others would go looking for them -- "Are you OK?
" Help them figure out what was troubling them that day.
The way Lisa put it to me, "As the garden began to bloom, we began to bloom.
" This approach is called social prescribing, it's spreading all over Europe.
And there's a small, but growing body of evidence suggesting it can produce real and meaningful falls in depression and anxiety.
And one day, I remember standing in the garden that Lisa and her once-depressed friends had built -- it's a really beautiful garden -- and having this thought, it's very much inspired by a guy called professor Hugh Mackay in Australia.
I was thinking, so often when people feel down in this culture, what we say to them -- I'm sure everyone here said it, I have -- we say, "You just need to be you, be yourself.
" And I've realized, actually, what we should say to people is, "Don't be you.
Don't be yourself.
Be us, be we.
Be part of a group.
" (Applause) The solution to these problems does not lie in drawing more and more on your resources as an isolated individual -- that's partly what got us in this crisis.
It lies on reconnecting with something bigger than you.
And that really connects to one of the other causes of depression and anxiety that I wanted to talk to you about.
So everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick.
I don't say that with any sense of superiority, I literally came to give this talk from McDonald's. I saw all of you eating that healthy TED breakfast, I was like no way.
But just like junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick, a kind of junk values have taken over our minds and made us mentally sick.
For thousands of years, philosophers have said, if you think life is about money, and status and showing off, you're going to feel like crap.
That's not an exact quote from Schopenhauer, but that is the gist of what he said.
But weirdly, hardy anyone had scientifically investigated this, until a truly extraordinary person I got to know, named professor Tim Kasser, who's at Knox College in Illinois, and he's been researching this for about 30 years now.
And his research suggests several really important things.
Firstly, the more you believe you can buy and display your way out of sadness, and into a good life, the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious.
And secondly, as a society, we have become much more driven by these beliefs.
All throughout my lifetime, under the weight of advertising and Instagram and everything like them.
And as I thought about this, I realized it's like we've all been fed since birth, a kind of KFC for the soul.
We've been trained to look for happiness in all the wrong places, and just like junk food doesn't meet your nutritional needs and actually makes you feel terrible, junk values don't meet your psychological needs, and they take you away from a good life.
But when I first spent time with professor Kasser and I was learning all this, I felt a really weird mixture of emotions.
Because on the one hand, I found this really challenging.
I could see how often in my own life, when I felt down, I tried to remedy it with some kind of show-offy, grand external solution.
And I could see why that did not work well for me.
I also thought, isn't this kind of obvious?
Isn't this almost like banal, right?
If I said to everyone here, none of you are going to lie on your deathbed and think about all the shoes you bought and all the retweets you got, you're going to think about moments of love, meaning and connection in your life.
I think that seems almost like a cliché.
" We know them so well they've become clichés, but we don't live by them.
I kept asking why, why would we know something so profound, but not live by it?
And after a while, professor Kasser said to me, "Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life.
" I had to really think about that. "Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life.
" And professor Kasser wanted to figure out if we can disrupt that machine.
He's done loads of research into this; I'll tell you about one example, and I really urge everyone here to try this with their friends and family.
With a guy called Nathan Dungan, he got a group of teenagers and adults to come together for a series of sessions over a period of time, to meet up.
And part of the point of the group was to get people to think about a moment in their life they had actually found meaning and purpose.
For different people, it was different things.
For some people, it was playing music, writing, helping someone -- I'm sure everyone here can picture something, right?
'" And what they found was, just having these meetings, it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous for consumerism, right?
Getting people to have these meetings, articulate these values, determine to act on them and check in with each other, led to a marked shift in people's values.
It took them away from this hurricane of depression-generating messages training us to seek happiness in the wrong places, and towards more meaningful and nourishing values that lift us out of depression.
At some level, we already know these things.
Why do we find it so hard to understand?
I think there's many reasons.
But I think one reason is that we have to change our understanding of what depression and anxiety actually are.
There are very real biological contributions to depression and anxiety.
It's just a malfunction.
It's like a glitch in a computer program, it's just a wiring problem in your head.
" But I was only able to start changing my life when I realized your depression is not a malfunction.
It's a signal.
Your depression is a signal.
It's telling you something.
(Applause) We feel this way for reasons, and they can be hard to see in the throes of depression -- I understand that really well from personal experience.
But with the right help, we can understand these problems and we can fix these problems together.
But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop insulting these signals by saying they're a sign of weakness, or madness or purely biological, except for a tiny number of people.
We need to start listening to these signals, because they're telling us something we really need to hear.
It's only when we truly listen to these signals, and we honor these signals and respect these signals, that we're going to begin to see the liberating, nourishing, deeper solutions.
The cows that are waiting all around us. Thank you.
(Applause)
Yogi Berra, a US baseball player and philosopher, said, "If we don't know where we're going, we might not get there.
We'll start with the food pyramid.
You all know the food pyramid.
Two in particular are iron and zinc. When you don't have enough iron, you can develop iron deficiency anemia. It's associated with fatigue, shortness of breath and some fairly serious consequences as well. When you don't have enough zinc, you can have a loss of appetite.
It is a significant problem around the world.
There's about one billion people who are zinc deficient.
It's very important for maternal and child health.
It affects development.
The B vitamins are critical for a whole range of reasons.
They help convert our food into energy.
They're important for the functions of many of the physiologic activities in our bodies.
And when you have higher carbon in a plant, you have less nitrogen, and you have less B vitamins.
And it's not just us.
Cattle are already being affected because the quality of their forage is declining.
And give a thought to, for example, our pet cats and dogs. If you look on the label of most of the pet and dog food, there's a significant amount of grain in those foods.
So this affects everyone.
In the field studies -- and I'll focus primarily on wheat and on rice -- there's fields, for example, of rice that are divided into different plots.
And the plots are all the same: the soil's the same, the precipitation's the same -- everything's the same.
Except carbon dioxide is blown over some of the plots.
And so you can compare what it looks like under today's conditions and under carbon dioxide conditions later in the century. I was part of one of the few studies that have done this.
We looked at 18 rice lines in China and in Japan and grew them under conditions that you would expect later in the century.
And when you look at the results, the white bar is today's conditions, the red bar is conditions later in the century. So protein declines about 10 percent, iron about eight percent, zinc about five percent.
When you look at vitamin B1 and vitamin B2, there's about a 17 percent decline.
Pantothenic acid, vitamin B5, is about a 13 percent decline.
Folate is about a 30 percent decline.
And these are averages over the various experiments that were done.
Folate is critical for child development.
Pregnant women who don't get enough folate are at much higher risk of having babies with birth defects. So these are very serious potential consequences for our health as CO2 continues to rise.
In another example, this is modeling work that was done by Chris Weyant and his colleagues, taking a look at this chain from higher CO2 to lower iron and zinc -- and they only looked at iron and zinc -- to various health outcomes.
They looked at malaria, diarrheal disease, pneumonia, iron deficiency anemia, and looked at what the consequences could be in 2050. And the darker the color in this, the larger the consequences.
So you can see the major impacts in Asia and in Africa, but also note that in countries such as the United States and countries in Europe, the populations also could be affected.
They estimated about 125 million people could be affected.
They also modeled what would be the most effective interventions, and their conclusion was reducing our greenhouse gases: getting our greenhouse gas emissions down by mid-century so we don't have to worry so much about these consequences later in the century.
These experiments, these modeling studies did not take climate change itself into account. They just focused on the carbon dioxide component.
But I can't. We don't have the research on that.
I'd love to tell you how much current food insecurity is affected by these changes.
But I can't. We don't have the research on that, either. There's a lot that needs to be known in this area, including what the possible solutions could be. We don't know exactly what those solutions are, but we've got a range of options.
We've got advancements in technologies.
We've got plant breeding.
We've got biofortification.
Soils could make a difference.
And, of course, it will be very helpful to know how these changes could affect our future health and the health of our children and the health of our grandchildren. And these investments take time. It will take time to sort all of these issues out.
There is no national entity or business group that is funding this research.
Let's not.
Let's invest in ourselves, in our children and in our planet. Thank you.
(Applause)
I am a capitalist, and after a 30-year career in capitalism spanning three dozen companies, generating tens of billions of dollars in market value, I'm not just in the top one percent, I'm in the top . 01 percent of all earners.
Today, I have come to share the secrets of our success, because rich capitalists like me have never been richer.
So the question is, how do we do it?
How do we manage to grab an ever-increasing share of the economic pie every year?
Is it that rich people are smarter than we were 30 years ago?
Is it that we're working harder than we once did?
Are we taller, better looking?
Sadly, no.
It all comes down to just one thing: economics.
Because, here's the dirty secret.
There was a time in which the economics profession worked in the public interest, but in the neoliberal era, today, they work only for big corporations and billionaires, and that is creating a little bit of a problem.
We could choose to enact economic policies that raise taxes on the rich, regulate powerful corporations or raise wages for workers.
We have done it before.
But neoliberal economists would warn that all of these policies would be a terrible mistake, because raising taxes always kills economic growth, and any form of government regulation is inefficient, and raising wages always kills jobs.
Well, as a consequence of that thinking, over the last 30 years, in the USA alone, the top one percent has grown 21 trillion dollars richer while the bottom 50 percent have grown 900 billion dollars poorer, a pattern of widening inequality that has largely repeated itself across the world.
And yet, as middle class families struggle to get by on wages that have not budged in about 40 years, neoliberal economists continue to warn that the only reasonable response to the painful dislocations of austerity and globalization is even more austerity and globalization.
So, what is a society to do?
Well, it's super clear to me what we need to do.
We need a new economics.
So, economics has been described as the dismal science, and for good reason, because as much as it is taught today, it isn't a science at all, in spite of all of the dazzling mathematics.
In fact, a growing number of academics and practitioners have concluded that neoliberal economic theory is dangerously wrong and that today's growing crises of rising inequality and growing political instability are the direct result of decades of bad economic theory.
What we can now see is that an economics that is neither just nor inclusive can never sustain the high levels of social cooperation necessary to enable a modern society to thrive.
So where did we go wrong?
Well, it turns out that it's become painfully obvious that the fundamental assumptions that undergird neoliberal economic theory are just objectively false, and so today first I want to take you through some of those mistaken assumptions and then after describe where the science suggests prosperity actually comes from.
So, neoliberal economic assumption number one is that the market is an efficient equilibrium system, which basically means that if one thing in the economy, like wages, goes up, another thing in the economy, like jobs, must go down.
So for example, in Seattle, where I live, when in 2014 we passed our nation's first 15 dollar minimum wage, the neoliberals freaked out over their precious equilibrium.
"If you raise the price of labor," they warned, "businesses will purchase less of it.
Thousands of low-wage workers will lose their jobs.
The restaurants will close.
" Except . . . they didn't.
The unemployment rate fell dramatically.
The restaurant business in Seattle boomed.
Why?
Because there is no equilibrium.
Because raising wages doesn't kill jobs, it creates them; because, for instance, when restaurant owners are suddenly required to pay restaurant workers enough so that now even they can afford to eat in restaurants, it doesn't shrink the restaurant business, it grows it, obviously.
(Applause) Thank you.
The second assumption is that the price of something is always equal to its value, which basically means that if you earn 50,000 dollars a year and I earn 50 million dollars a year, that's because I produce a thousand times as much value as you.
Now, it will not surprise you to learn that this is a very comforting assumption if you're a CEO paying yourself 50 million dollars a year but paying your workers poverty wages.
But please, take it from somebody who has run dozens of businesses: this is nonsense.
People are not paid what they are worth.
They are paid what they have the power to negotiate, and wages' falling share of GDP is not because workers have become less productive but because employers have become more powerful.
And -- (Applause) And by pretending that the giant imbalance in power between capital and labor doesn't exist, neoliberal economic theory became essentially a protection racket for the rich.
The third assumption, and by far the most pernicious, is a behavioral model that describes human beings as something called "homo economicus," which basically means that we are all perfectly selfish, perfectly rational and relentlessly self-maximizing.
But just ask yourselves, is it plausible that every single time for your entire life, when you did something nice for somebody else, all you were doing was maximizing your own utility?
Is it plausible that when a soldier jumps on a grenade to defend fellow soldiers, they're just promoting their narrow self-interest?
If you think that's nuts, contrary to any reasonable moral intuition, that's because it is and, according to the latest science, not true.
If we humans are merely selfish maximizers, then selfishness is the cause of our prosperity.
Under this economic logic, greed is good, widening inequality is efficient, and the only purpose of the corporation can be to enrich shareholders, because to do otherwise would be to slow economic growth and harm the economy overall.
So at the heart of this new economics is a story about ourselves that grants us permission to be our best selves, and, unlike the old economics, this is a story that is virtuous and also has the virtue of being true.
Now, I want to emphasize that this new economics is not something I have personally imagined or invented.
And although this new economics does not yet have its own textbook or even a commonly agreed upon name, in broad strokes its explanation of where prosperity comes from goes something like this.
So, market capitalism is an evolutionary system in which prosperity emerges through a positive feedback loop between increasing amounts of innovation and increasing amounts of consumer demand.
So how do we leave neoliberalism behind and build a more sustainable, more prosperous and more equitable society?
The new economics suggests just five rules of thumb.
Climate change, the great financial crisis of 2008 are two easy examples.
The second rule is that inclusion creates economic growth.
So the neoliberal idea that inclusion is this fancy luxury to be afforded if and when we have growth is both wrong and backwards.
The economy is people.
Including more people in more ways is what causes economic growth in market economies.
The third principle is the purpose of the corporation is not merely to enrich shareholders.
The greatest grift in contemporary economic life is the neoliberal idea that the only purpose of the corporation and the only responsibility of executives is to enrich themselves and shareholders.
The new economics must and can insist that the purpose of the corporation is to improve the welfare of all stakeholders: customers, workers, community and shareholders alike. Rule four: greed is not good.
Being rapacious doesn't make you a capitalist, it makes you a sociopath.
(Laughter) (Applause) And in an economy as dependent upon cooperation at scale as ours, sociopathy is as bad for business as it is for society.
And fifth and finally, unlike the laws of physics, the laws of economics are a choice.
Now, neoliberal economic theory has sold itself to you as unchangeable natural law, when in fact it's social norms and constructed narratives based on pseudoscience.
If we truly want a more equitable, more prosperous and more sustainable economy, if we want high-functioning democracies and civil society, we must have a new economics.
And here's the good news: if we want a new economics, all we have to do is choose to have it.
Thank you.
(Applause) Moderator: So Nick, I'm sure you get this question a lot. If you're so unhappy with the economic system, why not just give all your money away and join the 99 percent?
Nick Hanauer: Yeah, no, yes, right.
You get that a lot.
You get that a lot.
"If you care so much about taxes, why don't you pay more, and if you care so much about wages, why don't you pay more? " And I could do that.
The problem is, it doesn't make that much difference, and I have discovered a strategy that works literally a hundred thousand times better -- Moderator: OK.
NH: which is to use my money to build narratives and to pass laws that will require all the other rich people to pay taxes and pay their workers better.
(Applause) And so, for example, the 15-dollar minimum wage that we cooked up has now affected 30 million workers.
So that works better.
Moderator: That's great. If you change your mind, we'll find some takers for you.
NH: OK.
Thank you.
Moderator: Thank you very much.
The attacking infantry advances steadily, their elephants already having broken the defensive line.
The king tries to retreat, but enemy cavalry flanks him from the rear.
Escape is impossible.
But this isn’t a real war– nor is it just a game.
Over the roughly one-and-a-half millennia of its existence, chess has been known as a tool of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, and a benchmark of genius.
While our earliest records of chess are in the 7th century, legend tells that the game’s origins lie a century earlier.
The game was originally known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions.
" But with its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning king, and “checkmate” from "shah mat," or “the king is helpless.
” After the 7th century Islamic conquest of Persia, chess was introduced to the Arab world.
Transcending its role as a tactical simulation, it eventually became a rich source of poetic imagery.
Diplomats and courtiers used chess terms to describe political power.
Ruling caliphs became avid players themselves.
And historian al-Mas’udi considered the game a testament to human free will compared to games of chance.
Medieval trade along the Silk Road carried the game to East and Southeast Asia, where many local variants developed.
In China, chess pieces were placed at intersections of board squares rather than inside them, as in the native strategy game Go.
The reign of Mongol leader Tamerlane saw an 11x10 board with safe squares called citadels.
And in Japanese shogi, captured pieces could be used by the opposing player.
But it was in Europe that chess began to take on its modern form.
By 1000 AD, the game had become part of courtly education.
Chess was used as an allegory for different social classes performing their proper roles, and the pieces were re-interpreted in their new context.
At the same time, the Church remained suspicious of games.
Moralists cautioned against devoting too much time to them, with chess even being briefly banned in France.
Yet the game proliferated, and the 15th century saw it cohering into the form we know today.
The relatively weak piece of advisor was recast as the more powerful queen– perhaps inspired by the recent surge of strong female leaders.
This change accelerated the game’s pace, and as other rules were popularized, treatises analyzing common openings and endgames appeared.
Chess theory was born.
With the Enlightenment era, the game moved from royal courts to coffeehouses.
Chess was now seen as an expression of creativity, encouraging bold moves and dramatic plays.
This "Romantic" style reached its peak in the Immortal Game of 1851, where Adolf Anderssen managed a checkmate after sacrificing his queen and both rooks.
But the emergence of formal competitive play in the late 19th century meant that strategic calculation would eventually trump dramatic flair.
And with the rise of international competition, chess took on a new geopolitical importance.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union devoted great resources to cultivating chess talent, dominating the championships for the rest of the century.
But the player who would truly upset Russian dominance was not a citizen of another country but an IBM computer called Deep Blue.
Chess-playing computers had been developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion.
Today, chess software is capable of consistently defeating the best human players.
But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products of human ingenuity.
And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide us out of this apparent checkmate.
A long time ago, there lived a Giant, a Selfish Giant, whose stunning garden was the most beautiful in all the land.
One evening, this Giant came home and found all these children playing in his garden, and he became enraged.
"My own garden is my own garden!
" the Giant said.
And he built this high wall around it.
The author Oscar Wilde wrote the story of "The Selfish Giant" in 1888. Almost a hundred years later, that Giant moved into my Brooklyn childhood and never left.
But I learned that the deeper I went into my books, the more time I took with each sentence, the less I heard the noise of the outside world.
And so, unlike my siblings, who were racing through books, I read slowly -- very, very slowly.
I was that child with her finger running beneath the words, until I was untaught to do this; told big kids don't use their fingers.
In third grade, we were made to sit with our hands folded on our desk, unclasping them only to turn the pages, then returning them to that position. Our teacher wasn't being cruel.
It was the 1970s, and her goal was to get us reading not just on grade level but far above it.
And we were always being pushed to read faster.
But in the quiet of my apartment, outside of my teacher's gaze, I let my finger run beneath those words.
And that Selfish Giant again told me his story, how he had felt betrayed by the kids sneaking into his garden, how he had built this high wall, and it did keep the children out, but a grey winter fell over his garden and just stayed and stayed.
With each rereading, I learned something new about the hard stones of the roads that the kids were forced to play on when they got expelled from the garden, about the gentleness of a small boy that appeared one day, and even about the Giant himself.
Maybe his words weren't rageful after all.
Maybe they were a plea for empathy, for understanding.
"My own garden is my own garden.
Long before there was cable or the internet or even the telephone, there were people sharing ideas and information and memory through story.
It's one of our earliest forms of connective technology.
It was the story of something better down the Nile that sent the Egyptians moving along it, the story of a better way to preserve the dead that brought King Tut's remains into the 21st century.
And more than two million years ago, when the first humans began making tools from stone, someone must have said, "What if?
" And someone else remembered the story.
And whether they told it through words or gestures or drawings, it was passed down; remembered: hit a hammer and hear its story.
The world is getting noisier. We've gone from boomboxes to Walkmen to portable CD players to iPods to any song we want, whenever we want it.
We've gone from the four television channels of my childhood to the seeming infinity of cable and streaming.
As technology moves us faster and faster through time and space, it seems to feel like story is getting pushed out of the way, I mean, literally pushed out of the narrative.
But even as our engagement with stories change, or the trappings around it morph from book to audio to Instagram to Snapchat, we must remember our finger beneath the words.
Remember that story, regardless of the format, has always taken us to places we never thought we'd go, introduced us to people we never thought we'd meet and shown us worlds that we might have missed.
My love for looking deeply and closely at the world, for putting my whole self into it, and by doing so, seeing the many, many possibilities of a narrative, turned out to be a gift, because taking my sweet time taught me everything I needed to know about writing.
And writing taught me everything I needed to know about creating worlds where people could be seen and heard, where their experiences could be legitimized, and where my story, read or heard by another person, inspired something in them that became a connection between us, a conversation.
And isn't that what this is all about -- finding a way, at the end of the day, to not feel alone in this world, and a way to feel like we've changed it before we leave?
Stone to hammer, man to mummy, idea to story -- and all of it, remembered.
Sometimes we read to understand the future.
Sometimes we read to understand the past.
We read to get lost, to forget the hard times we're living in, and we read to remember those who came before us, who lived through something harder.
I write for those same reasons.
Before coming to Brooklyn, my family lived in Greenville, South Carolina, in a segregated neighborhood called Nicholtown.
All of us there were the descendants of a people who had not been allowed to learn to read or write.
And this is how it has always worked.
For as long as we've been communicating, there's been the layering to the narrative, the stories beneath the stories and the ones beneath those.
This is how story has and will continue to survive.
As I began to connect the dots that connected the way I learned to write and the way I learned to read to an almost silenced people, I realized that my story was bigger and older and deeper than I would ever be.
And because of that, it will continue.
Among these almost-silenced people there were the ones who never learned to read.
Their descendants, now generations out of enslavement, if well-off enough, had gone on to college, grad school, beyond.
Some, like my grandmother and my siblings, seemed to be born reading, as though history stepped out of their way. Some, like my mother, hitched onto the Great Migration wagon -- which was not actually a wagon -- and kissed the South goodbye.
So as a child, I learned to imagine an invisible finger taking me from word to word, from sentence to sentence, from ignorance to understanding.
So as technology continues to speed ahead, I continue to read slowly, knowing that I am respecting the author's work and the story's lasting power.
And I read slowly to drown out the noise and remember those who came before me, who were probably the first people who finally learned to control fire and circled their new power of flame and light and heat.
And I read slowly to remember the Selfish Giant, how he finally tore that wall down and let the children run free through his garden.
And I read slowly to pay homage to my ancestors, who were not allowed to read at all.
They, too, must have circled fires, speaking softly of their dreams, their hopes, their futures.
Each time we read, write or tell a story, we step inside their circle, and it remains unbroken.
And the power of story lives on.
Thank you.
(Applause)
[This talk contains mature content] I'm often asked what do I do.
To which I reply, "I work to end violence against children.
All violence against every child in every country.
" There's usually a pause.
Sometimes, depending on the setting, "Whoa, that's a conversation killer.
" And then the questions: "What sort of violence are you talking about?
" "How much violence is there?
" "Where is it happening, is it happening here?
" And when I answer those questions, people tend to be shocked.
Shocked at the scale of violence, shocked at the nature of violence. But I'm always quick to make sure that people aren't left with a sense of doom and gloom.
I believe we have an unprecedented historical opportunity in this generation to end violence against children.
There's a nascent movement building around this.
Governments, national governments, city governments, provinces and others are joining that movement.
And when we succeed -- and it will take all of us -- we will change the course of human history.
What do I mean by violence against children?
I mean all of the physical violence, sexual, psychological and emotional violence that happens to children at home, at school, online and in their communities.
We work with partners right across the world and from those partners, we hear disturbing stories of individual children.
For example, Sarah, age 10. Raped repeatedly by her stepfather and threatened with violence if she tells anyone.
Faisal, hit across the knuckles at school with a cable, shamed and called a donkey, made to stand outside in the cold when he gets the answers wrong.
And from the partners we work with to make the internet safer for children, we hear stories like that of Angelika.
Twelve years old, and forced to commit sexual acts on her uncle, which are live-streamed to paying adults the other side of the world.
One in 10 girls experiences sexual abuse before the age of 20. Half of children live in countries where corporal punishment has not been fully prohibited.
And last year alone, in the US, 45 million reports were made of images and videos of violent and sexual abuse of children online.
Twice the number the year before.
Now these forms of violence and other forms of violence roll up into some truly staggering numbers.
One billion children globally every year who experience some kind of violence.
That's one in two children.
This is a universal issue.
So what gives me optimism?
Let me talk about Sweden and Uganda.
Probably about as different as two countries you might imagine.
If you speak to an economist, they might tell you that Sweden has a per capita average income of around 50,000 dollars a year.
In Uganda, it's 2,000 dollars.
A historian might tell you Sweden hasn't been in a national conflict for about 200 years.
Uganda is still struggling with an insurgency in the north of the country.
A musician might tell you that Uganda, the national anthem, "Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty," is one of the shortest in the world.
In fact, so short, it's often played more than once.
I believe Swedes play theirs and sing theirs for a little longer.
But what does it really mean, what does it mean in practice?
When they make that commitment, what do they do?
It means high-level political commitment and leadership.
Enacting and implementing legislation.
And launching initiatives, changing policy, starting a national conversation that begins to raise awareness on a journey to changing attitudes and making it socially unacceptable to have any violence and abuse of children in a country.
It means recognizing that violence against children cuts across many sectors, and therefore the response, the answer, has to be a systems approach.
You can't just do one piece of it.
It requires multiple agencies within and beyond government.
It requires faith groups, the private sector, media, academia, civil society organizations and others.
And it requires drawing on what the best practice and the best evidence globally tells us, but using national-level data to shine a light on the often hidden story of violence in any given country.
And using that data to inform the national response, but also using it to measure and track progress.
And share what's working, being honest about when things aren't working.
And sharing inspiration when we see success and violence declining.
But can we really do this on a global scale?
One billion children a year experiencing violence.
I think we can.
In 2015, 193 world leaders committed their countries to end violence, abuse and neglect of children by 2030. Violence against children undermines all the other investments in them: in their health, in their education.
Often with multi-year, sometimes lifelong and intergenerational consequences and transmission.
But it's not just about international agreements and governments.
They really matter.
I think something's also changing more fundamentally, and we as societies around the world are finally calling out unacceptable behaviors which for too long have been tolerated.
Think of the #MeToo movement, and how sector after sector, industry after industry, calling out perpetrators, bringing and holding them to account.
It's a journey, but we've embarked upon it.
Look at what's happened in the aid industry.
Following some abuses of power, the aid industry is now taking very seriously the safeguarding of children across the world.
But maybe even more than that.
Children and young people themselves, part aided by technology, but they have a voice now that they may not, I don't think, have had before.
And they are using that voice, not just to advocate for the situation they see around them or what they know needs to improve, but to be part of the solutions of things that actually inform and affect their lives.
Think of those young activists who speak out against female genital mutilation, child marriage, cyber bullying, safe schools, harming conflict -- the list goes on and on.
Those children really matter.
So we have political leadership, we have youth activism, we have evidence-based solutions, we have public awareness growing -- we're on that pathway, beginning that journey to get to zero by 2030. But what are those solutions?
Three years ago, in 2016, 10 global institutions came together and aligned behind a framework which is a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to ending violence against children.
It's called INSPIRE.
It looks at the need for the relevant legislation, addressing social norms, parent and caregiver support, responses for children who have experienced violence and abuse. And safe schools, so children can be in a learning environment where they thrive.
In Uganda, four years ago, an eight-year-old girl could be married to a 30-year-old man.
That can no longer happen.
In 2016, the Children Act made that illegal and set the minimum age of marriage at 18. That's the I of INSPIRE: enact and implement legislation.
Cambodia is rolling out parental support, parent and caregiver support across the country, so parents are equipped to raise their children and to have discipline in a nonviolent way in the home.
In the Philippines, there are 100 centers set up to protect women and children nationwide.
That's the R of INSPIRE, response and support services.
And in Uganda, a safe schools toolkit has been rolled out now to half of teachers in Uganda, equipping them to control a class with nonviolent discipline.
That's the E of INSPIRE, education and life skills.
That's just some bits within some of the INSPIRE framework.
But more and more countries are committing to implement it, adapt it locally, inform it with the relevant data, put a plan together, work across sectors, and begin that journey to zero.
Canada, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, Tanzania -- I mentioned Sweden and Uganda already -- Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, more and more countries, and now cities, too.
See what works in a city, take something that's being prepared for implementation at a nationwide level and bring it down to the city level, where we believe that we can actually make probably faster and demonstrable progress in a shorter space of time.
And when we do that, that success will be shared through the learning lab and beyond at Edinburgh University.
Ending violence is the right thing to do, it's a smart investment to make, we have evidence-based solutions, and we have the beginnings of a journey.
He would no longer fear being at school and being bullied and hit and shamed by the teachers.
And Angelika and those like her would no longer be something, a commodity brought online for the enjoyment of adults thousands of miles away.
But then multiply the social, the economic, the cultural benefits of that.
Multiply those by every family, every community, village, town, city, country and suddenly, you've got a new normal emerging. A generation would grow up without having experienced violence.
But we do have an unprecedented opportunity to try, and I believe we also, as adults, have a responsibility to do this.
I'm doing my bit to end violence against children.
" Let's do this and do it now.
" And when I answer those questions, people tend to be shocked.
I believe we have an unprecedented historical opportunity in this generation to end violence against children.
And when we succeed -- and it will take all of us -- we will change the course of human history.
For example, Sarah, age 10. Raped repeatedly by her stepfather and threatened with violence if she tells anyone.
And launching initiatives, changing policy, starting a national conversation that begins to raise awareness on a journey to changing attitudes and making it socially unacceptable to have any violence and abuse of children in a country.
And it requires drawing on what the best practice and the best evidence globally tells us, but using national-level data to shine a light on the often hidden story of violence in any given country.
Often with multi-year, sometimes lifelong and intergenerational consequences and transmission.
In 2016, the Children Act made that illegal and set the minimum age of marriage at 18. That's the I of INSPIRE: enact and implement legislation.
In the Philippines, there are 100 centers set up to protect women and children nationwide.
Women and children who are either at high risk of abuse and violence or have experienced violence.
That's the R of INSPIRE, response and support services.
And in Uganda, a safe schools toolkit has been rolled out now to half of teachers in Uganda, equipping them to control a class with nonviolent discipline.
That's the E of INSPIRE, education and life skills.
That's just some bits within some of the INSPIRE framework.
But more and more countries are committing to implement it, adapt it locally, inform it with the relevant data, put a plan together, work across sectors, and begin that journey to zero.
Canada, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, Tanzania -- I mentioned Sweden and Uganda already -- Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, more and more countries, and now cities, too.
And right here in Scotland, University of Edinburgh is establishing a learning lab that's going to track the journey that cities in Scotland and the Philippines and Colombia go on together.
See what works in a city, take something that's being prepared for implementation at a nationwide level and bring it down to the city level, where we believe that we can actually make probably faster and demonstrable progress in a shorter space of time.
And when we do that, that success will be shared through the learning lab and beyond at Edinburgh University.
Ending violence is the right thing to do, it's a smart investment to make, we have evidence-based solutions, and we have the beginnings of a journey.
But what would happen if we actually end violence against children?
Let's just imagine for a moment.
First of all, think of the children I mentioned.
Sarah would no longer lie in her bed at night, fearful of the sound of her stepfather's footsteps coming up the stairs.
Faisal would go to school and he would thrive.
He would no longer fear being at school and being bullied and hit and shamed by the teachers.
And Angelika and those like her would no longer be something, a commodity brought online for the enjoyment of adults thousands of miles away.
But then multiply the social, the economic, the cultural benefits of that.
Multiply those by every family, every community, village, town, city, country and suddenly, you've got a new normal emerging. A generation would grow up without having experienced violence.
It will take us all.
But we do have an unprecedented opportunity to try, and I believe we also, as adults, have a responsibility to do this.
And then when we're all asked, "What do you do?
" each and every one of us can say, "I'm changing the course of human history.
I'm doing my bit to end violence against children.
" Let's do this and do it now.
Thank you.
(Applause)
[This is an improvised talk (and intro) based on a suggested topic from the audience.
The speaker doesn't know the content of the slides.
Here to give us his perspective, please welcome to the stage, Anthony Veneziale.
(Applause) (Laughter) Anthony Veneziale: You might think I know what you're going through.
You might be looking at me here on the red dot, or you might be looking at me on the screen.
There's a one sixth of a second delay.
Did I catch myself?
I did.
I could see myself before I turned, and that small delay creates a little bit of a divide.
(Laughter) And a divide is exactly what happens with human language, and the processing of that language.
I of course am working out of a small lab at MIT.
(Laughter) And we are scraping for every insight that we can get.
(Laughter) This is not often associated with a computational challenge, but in this case, we found that persistence of vision and auditory intake actually have more in common than we ever realized, and we can see it in this first slide.
(Laughter) (Applause) Immediately your processing goes to, "Is that a hard-boiled egg?
" (Laughter) "Is that perhaps the structural integrity of the egg being able to sustain the weight of what seems to be a rock?
Aha, is it in fact a real rock?
" We go to questions when we see visual information.
But when we hear information, this is what happens.
(Laughter) The floodgates in our mind open much like the streets of Shanghai.
(Applause) So many pieces of information to process, so many ideas, concepts, feelings and, of course, vulnerabilities that we don't often wish to share.
And so we hide, and we hide behind what we like to call the floodgate of intimacy.
(Laughter) And what might that floodgate be holding?
What is the dike upon which it is built?
Well, first off -- (Laughter) we found that it's different for six different genotypes.
(Applause) And, of course, we can start categorizing these genotypes into a neuronormative experience and a neurodiverse experience.
(Laughter) On the right-hand side of the screen, you're seeing spikes for the neurodiverse thinking.
Now, there are generally only two emotional states that a neurodiverse brain can tabulate and keep count of at any given time, thereby eliminating the possibility for them to be emotionally, sometimes, attuned to the present situation.
(Laughter) But of course, what is the neural network that is helping to bridge and build these different discrepancies?
(Laughter) (Applause) And as we all know, fear resides in the amygdala, and it is a very natural response, and it is very closely linked with visual perception.
It is not as closely linked with verbal perception, so our fear receptors often will be going off in advance of any of our cognitive usage around verbal and words and cues of language.
(Laughter) (Applause) You are more readily available to failing first, and failing first -- (Laughter) far outweighs the lengths we go to to appeal to others, to our partners and to ourselves.
(Applause) (Laughter) It sounds hard, doesn't it?
We don't want to just sit on the couch.
(Laughter) Will it meet all of us at the same time, I think, is the variable we are inquiring.
(Laughter) And a divide is exactly what happens with human language, and the processing of that language.
" (Laughter) "Is that perhaps the structural integrity of the egg being able to sustain the weight of what seems to be a rock?
(Laughter) Fear.
(Laughter) (Applause) And as we all know, fear resides in the amygdala, and it is a very natural response, and it is very closely linked with visual perception.
It is not as closely linked with verbal perception, so our fear receptors often will be going off in advance of any of our cognitive usage around verbal and words and cues of language.
So as we see these fear moments, we of course are taken aback.
We stumble in a certain direction, generally away from the intimacy.
(Laughter) Now of course, there's a difference between the male perception and the female perception and of trans and those who are in between, all of those as well, and outside of the gender spectrum.
(Laughter) But fear is the central underlying underpinning of all of our response systems.
Fight-or-flight is one of the earliest, some say reptilian, response to our environment.
How can we disengage or unhook ourselves from the horns of the amygdala?
(Laughter) Well, I'd like to tell you the secret right now.
(Applause) This is all making much, much too much sense.
We spend billions and billions of dollars on clothing, on makeup, on the latest trend of glasses, but what we don't spend money and time on is connecting with each other in a way that is truthful and honest and stripped of those visual receptors.
(Applause) (Laughter) It sounds hard, doesn't it?
(Laughter) But we want to be aggressive about this.
We don't want to just sit on the couch.
As a historian said earlier today, it's important to get up and circumvent sometimes that couch.
And how can we do it?
Well yes, ice is a big part of it.
Insights, compassion and empathy: I, C, E.
(Applause) And when we start using this ice method, well, the possibilities become much bigger than us.
In fact, they become smaller than you.
(Laughter) Will it meet all of us at the same time, I think, is the variable we are inquiring.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I mean managing land in a way that's smart about maximizing how much carbon we store in soil.
Hello, my name is Dessa, and I'm a member of a hip-hop collective called Doomtree.
I'm the one in the tank top.
(Laughter) And I make my living as a performing, touring rapper and singer.
When we perform as a collective, this is what our shows look like.
I'm the one in the boots.
There's a lot of jumping.
There's a lot of sweating.
It's loud.
It's very high-energy.
Sometimes there are unintentional body checks onstage.
Sometimes there are completely intentional body checks onstage.
It's kind of a hybrid between an intramural hockey game and a concert.
However, when I perform my own music as a solo artist, I tend to gravitate towards more melancholy sounds.
A few years ago, I gave my mom the rough mixes of a new album, and she said, "Baby, it's beautiful, but why is it always so sad?
" (Laughter) "You always make music to bleed out to.
" And I thought, "Who are you hanging out with that you know that phrase?
" (Laughter) But over the course of my career, I've written so many sad love songs that I got messages like this from fans: "Release new music or a book.
I need help with my breakup.
" (Laughter) And after performing and recording and touring those songs for a long time, I found myself in a position in which my professional niche was essentially romantic devastation.
What I hadn't been public about, however, was the fact that most of these songs had been written about the same guy.
And for two years, we tried to sort ourselves out, and then for five and on and off for 10. And I was not only heartbroken, but I was kind of embarrassed that I couldn't rebound from what other people seemed to recover from so regularly.
And even though I knew it wasn't doing either of us any good, I just couldn't figure out how to put the love down.
Then, drinking white wine one night, I saw a TED Talk by a woman named Dr. Helen Fisher, and she said that in her work, she'd been able to map the coordinates of love in the human brain.
And I thought, well, if I could find my love in my brain, maybe I could get it out.
So I went to Twitter.
"Anybody got access to an fMRI lab, like at midnight or something?
I'll trade for backstage passes and whiskey.
" (Laughter) And that's Dr. Cheryl Olman, who works at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research.
She took me up on it.
I explained Dr. Fisher's protocol, and we decided to recreate it with a sample size of one, me.
(Laughter) So I got decked out in a pair of forest green scrubs, and I was laid on a gurney and wheeled into an fMRI machine.
If you're unfamiliar with that technology, essentially, an fMRI machine is a big, tubular magnet that tracks the progress of deoxygenated iron in your blood.
So it's essentially figuring out what parts of your brain are making the biggest metabolic demand at any given moment.
He was the control.
(Laughter) And when I left the machine, we had these really high-resolution images of my brain.
We could cleave the two halves apart.
We could inflate the cortex to see inside all of the wrinkles, essentially, in a view that Dr. Cheryl Olman called the "brain skin rug.
" (Laughter) And we could see how my brain had behaved when I looked at images of both men.
And this was important.
So when we did that data comparison, we subtracted one from the other, we found activity in exactly the regions that Dr. Fisher would have predicted.
That's me.
And that's my brain in love.
There was activity in that little orange dot, the ventral tegmental area, that kind of loop of red is the anterior cingulate and that golden set of horns is the caudates.
After she had had time to analyze the data with her team and a couple of partners, Andrea and Phil, Cheryl sent me an image, a single slide.
It was my brain in cross section, with one bright dot of activity that represented my feelings for this dude.
And I'd known I was in love, and that's the whole reason I was going to these outrageous lengths.
But having an image that proved it felt like such a vindication, like, "Yeah, it's all in my head, but now I know exactly where.
" (Laughter) And I also felt like an assassin who had her mark.
That was what I had to annihilate.
So I decided to embark on a course of treatment called "neurofeedback.
" I worked with a woman named Penijean Gracefire, and she explained that what we'd be doing was training my brain.
We're not lobotomizing anything.
We're training it in the way that we would train a muscle, so that it would be flexible enough and resilient enough to respond appropriately to my circumstances.
So when we're on the treadmill, we would anticipate that our heart would beat and pound, and when we're asleep, we would ask that that muscle slow.
Similarly, when I'm in a long-term, viable, loving romantic relationship, the emotional centers of my brain should engage, and when I'm not in a long-term, viable, emotional, loving relationship, they should eventually chill out.
So she came over with a set of electrodes just smaller than a dime that were sensitive enough to detect my brainwaves through my bone and hair and scalp.
And when she rigged me up, I could see my brain working in real time.
And in another view that she showed me, I could see exactly which parts of my brain were hyperactive, here displayed in red; hypoactive, here displayed in blue; and the healthy threshold of behavior, the green zone, the Goldilocks zone, which is where I wanted to go.
And we can, in fact, isolate just those parts of my brain that were associated with the romantic regulation that we'd identified in the Fisher study.
So Penijean, several times, hooked me up with all her electrodes, and she explained that I didn't have to do or think anything.
I just essentially had to hold pretty still and stay awake and watch.
(Harp and vibraphone sounds play) So I did.
And every time my brain operated in that healthy threshold, I got a little run of harp or vibraphone music.
And I just watched my brain rotate at roughly the speed of a gyro machine on my dad's flat-screen TV. And that was counterintuitive.
When you ride a bike, I don't really know what, like, my left calf muscle is doing, or how my latissimus dorsi knows to engage when I wobble to the right.
The body just learns.
And similarly, Pavlov's dogs probably don't know a lot about, like, protein structures or the waveform of a ringing bell, but they salivate nonetheless because the body paired the stimuli.
Finished the sessions, went back to Dr. Cheryl Olman's fMRI machine, and we repeated the protocol, the same images -- of the ex, of the control and, in the interest of scientific rigor, Cheryl and her team didn't know who was who, so that they couldn't influence the results.
And after she had time to analyze that second set of data, she sent me that image.
She said, "Dude A's dominance of your brain seems to essentially have been eradicated.
I think this is the desired result," comma, yes, question mark.
(Laughter) And that was the exactly the desired result.
And finally, I allowed myself a moment to introspect, like, how did I feel?
And in one way, it felt like it was the same inventory of feelings that I'd had at the outset.
This isn't "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
" The dude wasn't a stranger.
But I'd had love and jealousy and amity and attraction and respect and all those complicated feelings that you amass after long-term love.
But it felt like the benevolent feelings had risen to the surface, and the feelings of fixation and the less-generous feelings weren't quite so present.
And that sounds like a small thing in some way, this resequencing of feelings, but to me it felt like the biggest thing.
Like, if I told you, "I'm going to anesthetize you, and I'm also going to take out your wisdom teeth," it would really matter to you the sequence in which I did those two things.
(Laughter) And I also felt like I'd had this really unusual philosophical privilege to understand love.
The lab offered to 3D-print my caudate.
I got to hold love in my hand.
(Laughter) And then I bronzed it, and I made it into a necklace and sold it at the merch table at my shows.
And I felt like I'd had the opportunity to better understand love, even the compulsive parts.
It isn't a neat, symmetrical Valentine's heart.
It's bodily, it's systemic, it is a hideous pair of ram's horns buried somewhere deep within your skull, and when that special boy walks by, it lights up, and if he likes you back and you make each other happy, then you fan the flames.
And if he doesn't, then you assemble a team of neuroscientists to snuff them out by force.
(Laughter) Thanks. (Applause)
For all that's ever been said about climate change, we haven't heard nearly enough about the psychological impacts of living in a warming world.
If you've heard the grim climate research that science communicators like me weave into our books and documentaries, you've probably felt bouts of fear, fatalism or hopelessness.
If you've been impacted by climate disaster, these feelings can set in much deeper, leading to shock, trauma, strained relationships, substance abuse and the loss of personal identity and control.
Vital political and technological work is underway to moderate our climate chaos, but I'm here to evoke a feeling in you for why we also need our actions and policies to reflect an understanding of how our changing environments threaten our mental, social and spiritual well-being.
The anxiety, grief and depression of climate scientists and activists have been reported on for years.
Trends we've seen after extreme weather events like hurricane Sandy or Katrina for increased PTSD and suicidality.
And there are rich mental-health data from northern communities where warming is the fastest, like the Inuit in Labrador, who face existential distress as they witness the ice, a big part of their identity, vanishing before their eyes.
Now if that weren't enough, the American Psychological Association says that our psychological responses to climate change, like conflict avoidance, helplessness and resignation, are growing.
This means that our conscious and unconscious mental processes are holding us back from identifying the causes of the problem for what they are, working on solutions and fostering our own psychological resilience, but we need all those things to take on what we've created.
Lately, I've been studying a phenomenon that's just one example of the emotional hardships that we're seeing.
And it comes in the form of a question that a significant amount of people in my generation are struggling to answer.
That being: Should I have a child in the age of climate change?
After all, any child born today will have to live in a world where hurricanes, flooding, wildfires -- what we used to call natural disasters -- have become commonplace.
The hottest 20 years on record occurred within the last 22. The UN expects that two-thirds of the global population may face water shortages only six years from now.
The World Bank predicts that by 2050, there's going to be 140 million climate refugees in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and South Asia.
And other estimates put that number at over one billion.
Mass migrations and resource scarcity increase the risk for violence, war and political instability.
The UN just reported that we are pushing up to a million species to extinction, many within decades, and our emissions are still increasing, even after the Paris Agreement.
Over the last year and a half, I've been conducting workshops and interviews with hundreds of people about parenting in the climate crisis.
And I can tell you that people who are worried about having kids because of climate change are not motivated by an ascetic pride.
They're nerve-racked.
There's even a movement called BirthStrike, whose members have declared they're not going to have kids because of the state of the ecological crisis and inaction from governments to address this existential threat.
And yes, other generations have also faced their own apocalyptic dangers, but that is no reason to disregard the very real threat to our survival now.
Some feel that it's better to adopt children.
Or that it's unethical to have more than one, especially three, four or more, because kids increase greenhouse gas emissions.
Now, it is a really unfortunate state of affairs when people who want kids sacrifice their right to because, somehow, they have been told that their lifestyle choices are to blame when the fault is far more systemic, but let's just unpack the logic here.
So an oft-cited study shows that, on average, having one less child in an industrialized nation can save about 59 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
So this is why some people argue that it's parents from nations with huge carbon footprints who should think the hardest about how many kids they have.
But the decision to have a child and one's feelings about the future are deeply personal, and wrapped up in all sorts of cultural norms, religious beliefs, socioeconomic status, education levels and more.
And so to some, this debate about kids in the climate crisis can seem like it came from another planet.
Many have more immediate threats to their survival to think about, like, how they're going to put food on the table, when they're a single mom working three jobs, or they're HIV positive or on the move in a migrant caravan.
Tragically, though, climate change is really great at intersectionality.
It multiplies the stresses marginalized communities already face.
A political scientist once said to me that a leading indicator that climate change is starting to hit home, psychologically, would be an increase in the rate of informed women deciding to not have children. Interesting. Is it hitting home with you, psychologically?
Are you perhaps someone with climate-linked pre-traumatic stress?
A climate psychiatrist coined that term, and that's a profession now, by the way, shrinks for climate woes.
They're getting work at a time when some high schoolers don't want to apply to university any longer, because they can't foresee a future for themselves.
And this brings me back to my main point.
The growing concern about having kids in the climate crisis is an urgent indicator of how hard-pressed people are feeling.
Right now, students around the world are screaming for change in the piercing voice of despair.
And the fact that we can see how we contribute to this problem that makes us feel unsafe is crazy-making in itself.
Climate change is all-encompassing and so are the ways that it messes with our minds.
Many activists will tell you that the best antidote to grief is activism.
And some psychologists will tell you the answer can be found in therapy.
Others believe the key is to imagine you're on your deathbed, reflecting back on what's mattered the most in your life, so you can identify what you should do more of now, with the time that you have left.
We need all these ideas, and more, to take care of our innermost selves as the environments we've known become more punishing towards us.
And whether you have children or not, we need to be honest about what is happening, and what we owe one another.
We cannot afford to treat the psychological impacts of climate change as some afterthought, because the other issues, of science, technology and the politics and economy, feel hard, while this somehow feels soft.
Mental health needs to be an integral part of any climate change survival strategy, requiring funding, and ethics of equity and care, and widespread awareness.
Because even if you're the most emotionally avoidant person on the planet, there's no rug in the world that's big enough to sweep this up under.
Thank you.
(Applause)
About 200 years ago, Napoleon famously warned . . . He said, "Let China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world.
" Despite this early warning, the West chose to go to sleep at precisely the moment when China and India and the rest of Asia woke up.
Why did this happen?
I'm here to address this great mystery.
Now what do I mean when I say the West chose to go to sleep?
Here I'm referring to the failure of the West to react intelligently and thoughtfully to a new world environment that's obviously been created by the return of Asia.
As a friend of the West I feel anguished by this, so my goal to today is to try to help the West.
But I have to begin the story first by talking about how the West actually woke up the rest of the world.
Look at chart one.
From the year one through the year 1820, the two largest economies of the world were always those of China and India.
So it's only in the last 200 years that Europe took off, followed by North America.
So the past 200 years of world history have therefore been a major historical aberration. All aberrations come to a natural end and this is what we are seeing.
And if you look at chart two, you'll see how quickly and how forcefully China and India are coming back.
The big question is: Who woke up China and India?
The only honest answer to this question is that it was Western civilization that did so.
We all know that the West was the first to successfully modernize, transform itself; initially it used its power to colonize and dominate the world.
But over time, it shared the gifts of Western wisdom with the rest of the world.
Let me add here that I have personally benefited from the sharing of Western wisdom.
When I was born in Singapore, which was then a poor British colony, in 1948, I experienced, like three-quarters of humanity then, extreme poverty.
Indeed, on the first day when I went to school at the age of six, I was put in a special feeding program because I was technically undernourished.
Now reasoning was not invented by the West.
It's inherent in all cultures and civilizations. Amartya Sen has described how deeply embedded it is in Indian civilization.
Yet there's also no doubt that it was the West that carried the art of reasoning to a much higher level.
And as an Asian, I can describe how these silent revolutions transformed Asia.
The first revolution was in economics.
The main reason why so many Asian economies, including the communist societies of China and Vietnam, have performed so spectacularly well in economic development, is because they finally understood, absorbed and are implementing free market economics -- a gift from the West.
Adam Smith was right.
If you let markets decide, productivity goes up.
The second gift was psychological.
Here too I can speak from personal experience. When I was young, my mother and her generation believed that life was determined by fate.
You couldn't do anything about it.
My generation and the generation of Asians after me, believe that we can take charge and we can improve our lives.
And this may explain, for example, the spike of entrepreneurship you see all throughout Asia today. And if you travel through Asia today, you will also see the results of the third revolution: the revolution of good governance.
Now as a result of good governance -- travel in Asia, you see better health care, better education, better infrastructure, better public policies.
It's a different world.
Now having transformed the world through the sharing of Western wisdom with the rest of the world, the logical and rational response of the West should have been to say, "Hey, we have to adjust and adapt to this new world. " Instead, the West chose to go to sleep.
Why did it happen?
I believe it happened because the West became distracted with two major events. The first event was the end of the Cold War.
Yes, the end of the Cold War was a great victory.
The West defeated the mighty Soviet Union without firing a shot. Amazing. But you know, when you have a great victory like this, it also leads to arrogance and hubris.
And this hubris was best captured in a very famous essay by Francis Fukuyama called "The End of History?
9/11 also generated a lot of anger, and in this anger, the United States decided to invade Afghanistan and later, Iraq. And unfortunately, partly as a result of this anger, the West didn't notice the significance of another event that happened also in 2001. China joined the World Trade Organization.
It also contributed to the rise of populism in Europe. And one wonders, could this populism have been avoided if the West had not been distracted by the end of the Cold War and by 9/11? But the big question we face today is this: Is it too late?
Has the West lost everything?
And my answer is that it's not too late.
It is possible for the West to recover and come back in strength.
And using the Western art of reasoning, I would recommend that the West adopt a new "three-m" strategy: minimalist, multilateral and Machiavellian.
(Laughter) Why minimalist?
Now even though Western domination has ended, the West continues to intervene and interfere in the affairs of many other societies. This is unwise.
This is generating anger and resentment, especially in Islamic societies.
Southeast Asia is also one of the most diverse continents on planet earth, because you also have 146 million Christians, 149 million Buddhists -- Mahayana Buddhists and Hinayana Buddhists -- and you also have millions of Taoists and Confucianists and Hindus and even communists.
And once known as "the Balkans of Asia," southeast Asia today should be experiencing a clash of civilizations. Instead, what you see in southeast Asia is one of the most peaceful and prosperous corners of planet earth with the second-most successful regional multilateral organization, ASEAN. So clearly, minimalism can work.
The West should try it out. (Laughter) (Applause) But I'm also aware that minimalism cannot solve all the problems. There are some hard problems that have to be dealt with: Al-Qaeda, ISIS -- they remain dangerous threats.
Now I've been ambassador to the UN twice.
Maybe that makes me a bit biased, but I can tell you that working with the UN can lead to success. Why is it that the first Iraq war, fought by President George H. W. Bush, succeeded?
While the second Iraq war, fought by his son, President George W. Bush, failed?
One key reason is that the senior Bush went to the UN to get the support of the global community before fighting the war in Iraq.
So multilateralism works.
There's another reason why we have to work with the UN.
The world is shrinking.
We are becoming a small, interdependent, global village. All villages need village councils.
And the only global village counsel we have, as the late UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, is the UN.
Now as a geopolitical analyst, I do know that it's often considered naive to work with the UN.
So now let me inject my Machiavellian point. Now Machiavelli is a figure who's often derided in the West, but the liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin reminded us that the goal of Machiavelli was to promote virtue, not evil.
So what is the Machiavellian point?
It's this: what is the best way for the West to constrain the new rising powers that are emerging?
And the answer is that the best way to constrain them is through multilateral rules and multilateral norms, multilateral institutions and multilateral processes.
Now let me conclude with one final, big message. As a longtime friend of the West, I'm acutely aware of how pessimistic Western societies have become.
Many in the West don't believe that a great future lies ahead for them, that their children will not have better lives.
Let's embrace it together.
Thank you.

At a Maryland country fair in 2017, the prize pigs were not looking their best.
Farmers reported feverish hogs with inflamed eyes and running snouts.
But while fair officials worried about the pigs, the Maryland department of health was concerned about a group of sick fairgoers.
Some had pet the pigs, while others had merely been near their barns; but soon, 40 of these attendees would be diagnosed with swine flu.
More often than not, sick animals don’t infect humans.
But when they do, these cross-species infections, or viral host jumps, have the potential to produce deadly epidemics.
So how can pathogens from one species infect another, and what makes host jumps so dangerous?
Viruses are a type of organic parasite infecting nearly all forms of life.
To survive and reproduce, they must move through three stages: contact with a susceptible host, infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals.
As an example, let’s look at human influenza.
First, the flu virus encounters a new host and makes its way into their respiratory tract.
This isn’t so difficult, but to survive in this new body, the virus must mount a successful infection before it’s caught and broken down by an immune response.
To accomplish this task, viruses have evolved specific interactions with their host species.
Human flu viruses are covered in proteins adapted to bind with matching receptors on human respiratory cells.
Once inside a cell, the virus employs additional adaptations to hijack the host cell’s reproductive machinery and replicate its own genetic material.
However, this simple sneeze also brings the virus in contact with pets, plants, or even your lunch.
Viruses are constantly encountering new species and attempting to infect them.
More often than not, this ends in failure.
In most cases, the genetic dissimilarity between the two hosts is too great.
For a virus adapted to infect humans, a lettuce cell would be a foreign and inhospitable landscape.
But there are a staggering number of viruses circulating in the environment, all with the potential to encounter new hosts.
And because viruses rapidly reproduce by the millions, they can quickly develop random mutations.
Most mutations will have no effect, or even prove detrimental; but a small proportion may enable the pathogen to better infect a new species.
The odds of winning this destructive genetic lottery increase over time, or if the new species is closely related to the virus’ usual host.
For a virus adapted to another mammal, infecting a human might just take a few lucky mutations.
And a virus adapted to chimpanzees, one of our closest genetic relatives, might barely require any changes at all.
It takes more than time and genetic similarity for a host jump to be successful.
Some viruses come equipped to easily infect a new host’s cells, but are then unable to evade an immune response.
Others might have a difficult time transmitting to new hosts.
For example, they might make the host’s blood contagious, but not their saliva.
However, once a host jump reaches the transmission stage, the virus becomes much more dangerous.
Now gestating within two hosts, the pathogen has twice the odds of mutating into a more successful virus.
And each new host increases the potential for a full-blown epidemic.
Virologists are constantly looking for mutations that might make viruses such as influenza more likely to jump.
However, predicting the next potential epidemic is a major challenge.
There’s a huge diversity of viruses that we’re only just beginning to uncover.
Researchers are tirelessly studying the biology of these pathogens.
And by monitoring populations to quickly identify new outbreaks, they can develop vaccines and containment protocols to stop these deadly diseases.
Recently, the leadership team of an American supermarket chain decided that their business needed to get a lot more efficient.
So they embraced their digital transformation with zeal.
Out went the teams supervising meat, veg, bakery, and in came an algorithmic task allocator.
Now, instead of people working together, each employee went, clocked in, got assigned a task, did it, came back for more.
This was scientific management on steroids, standardizing and allocating work. It was super efficient.
Well, not quite, because the task allocator didn't know when a customer was going to drop a box of eggs, couldn't predict when some crazy kid was going to knock over a display, or when the local high school decided that everybody needed to bring in coconuts the next day.
(Laughter) Efficiency works really well when you can predict exactly what you're going to need.
But when the anomalous or unexpected comes along -- kids, customers, coconuts -- well, then efficiency is no longer your friend.
This has become a really crucial issue, this ability to deal with the unexpected, because the unexpected is becoming the norm.
It's why experts and forecasters are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out.
Why?
Because over the last 20 or 30 years, much of the world has gone from being complicated to being complex -- which means that yes, there are patterns, but they don't repeat themselves regularly.
It means that very small changes can make a disproportionate impact.
And it means that expertise won't always suffice, because the system just keeps changing too fast.
So what that means is that there's a huge amount in the world that kind of defies forecasting now.
It's why the Bank of England will say yes, there will be another crash, but we don't know why or when.
We know that climate change is real, but we can't predict where forest fires will break out, and we don't know which factories are going to flood.
It's why companies are blindsided when plastic straws and bags and bottled water go from staples to rejects overnight, and baffled when a change in social mores turns stars into pariahs and colleagues into outcasts: ineradicable uncertainty.
In an environment that defies so much forecasting, efficiency won't just not help us, it specifically undermines and erodes our capacity to adapt and respond.
So if efficiency is no longer our guiding principle, how should we address the future?
What kind of thinking is really going to help us?
What sort of talents must we be sure to defend?
I think that, where in the past we used to think a lot about just in time management, now we have to start thinking about just in case, preparing for events that are generally certain but specifically remain ambiguous.
One example of this is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI.
We know there will be more epidemics in future, but we don't know where or when or what.
So we can't plan.
But we can prepare.
So CEPI's developing multiple vaccines for multiple diseases, knowing that they can't predict which vaccines are going to work or which diseases will break out.
So some of those vaccines will never be used.
That's inefficient.
But it's robust, because it provides more options, and it means that we don't depend on a single technological solution.
Epidemic responsiveness also depends hugely on people who know and trust each other.
But those relationships take time to develop, time that is always in short supply when an epidemic breaks out.
So CEPI is developing relationships, friendships, alliances now knowing that some of those may never be used.
That's inefficient, a waste of time, perhaps, but it's robust.
You can see robust thinking in financial services, too.
In the past, banks used to hold much less capital than they're required to today, because holding so little capital, being too efficient with it, is what made the banks so fragile in the first place.
Now, holding more capital looks and is inefficient.
But it's robust, because it protects the financial system against surprises. Countries that are really serious about climate change know that they have to adopt multiple solutions, multiple forms of renewable energy, not just one.
The countries that are most advanced have been working for years now, changing their water and food supply and healthcare systems, because they recognize that by the time they have certain prediction, that information may very well come too late.
You can take the same approach to trade wars, and many countries do.
Instead of depending on a single huge trading partner, they try to be everybody's friends, because they know they can't predict which markets might suddenly become unstable.
It's time-consuming and expensive, negotiating all these deals, but it's robust because it makes their whole economy better defended against shocks.
It's particularly a strategy adopted by small countries that know they'll never have the market muscle to call the shots, so it's just better to have too many friends.
But if you're stuck in one of these organizations that's still kind of captured by the efficiency myth, how do you start to change it?
Try some experiments.
In the Netherlands, home care nursing used to be run pretty much like the supermarket: standardized and prescribed work to the minute: nine minutes on Monday, seven minutes on Wednesday, eight minutes on Friday.
The nurses hated it.
So one of them, Jos de Blok, proposed an experiment.
Since every patient is different, and we don't quite know exactly what they'll need, why don't we just leave it to the nurses to decide?
Sound reckless?
(Laughter) (Applause) In his experiment, Jos found the patients got better in half the time, and costs fell by 30 percent.
" So now this form of nursing has proliferated across the Netherlands and around the world.
But in every new country it still starts with experiments, because each place is slightly and unpredictably different.
Of course, not all experiments work.
Jos tried a similar approach to the fire service and found it didn't work because the service is just too centralized.
Failed experiments look inefficient, but they're often the only way you can figure out how the real world works.
So now he's trying teachers.
Experiments like that require creativity and not a little bravery.
In England -- I was about to say in the UK, but in England -- (Laughter) (Applause) In England, the leading rugby team, or one of the leading rugby teams, is Saracens.
The manager and the coach there realized that all the physical training they do and the data-driven conditioning that they do has become generic; really, all the teams do exactly the same thing.
So they risked an experiment.
They took the whole team away, even in match season, on ski trips and to look at social projects in Chicago.
This was expensive, it was time-consuming, and it could be a little risky putting a whole bunch of rugby players on a ski slope, right?
(Laughter) But what they found was that the players came back with renewed bonds of loyalty and solidarity.
And now when they're on the pitch under incredible pressure, they manifest what the manager calls "poise" -- an unflinching, unwavering dedication to each other.
Their opponents are in awe of this, but still too in thrall to efficiency to try it.
At a London tech company, Verve, the CEO measures just about everything that moves, but she couldn't find anything that made any difference to the company's productivity.
So she devised an experiment that she calls "Love Week": a whole week where each employee has to look for really clever, helpful, imaginative things that a counterpart does, call it out and celebrate it.
It takes a huge amount of time and effort; lots of people would call it distracting.
But it really energizes the business and makes the whole company more productive.
Preparedness, coalition-building, imagination, experiments, bravery -- in an unpredictable age, these are tremendous sources of resilience and strength.
They aren't efficient, but they give us limitless capacity for adaptation, variation and invention.
And the less we know about the future, the more we're going to need these tremendous sources of human, messy, unpredictable skills.
But in our growing dependence on technology, we're asset-stripping those skills.
Every time we use technology to nudge us through a decision or a choice or to interpret how somebody's feeling or to guide us through a conversation, we outsource to a machine what we could, can do ourselves, and it's an expensive trade-off.
The more we let machines think for us, the less we can think for ourselves.
The more -- (Applause) The more time doctors spend staring at digital medical records, the less time they spend looking at their patients.
The more we use parenting apps, the less we know our kids.
The more time we spend with people that we're predicted and programmed to like, the less we can connect with people who are different from ourselves.
And the less compassion we need, the less compassion we have.
What all of these technologies attempt to do is to force-fit a standardized model of a predictable reality onto a world that is infinitely surprising.
Now, as I was thinking about the extremes of stress and turbulence that we know we will have to confront, I went and I talked to a number of chief executives whose own businesses had gone through existential crises, when they teetered on the brink of collapse.
These were frank, gut-wrenching conversations.
Many men wept just remembering.
So I asked them: "What kept you going through this?
" And they all had exactly the same answer.
"It wasn't data or technology," they said. "It was my friends and my colleagues who kept me going.
" One added, "It was pretty much the opposite of the gig economy.
" But then I went and I talked to a group of young, rising executives, and I asked them, "Who are your friends at work?
" And they just looked blank.
"There's no time.
" "They're too busy.
" "It's not efficient.
" Who, I wondered, is going to give them imagination and stamina and bravery when the storms come?
Anyone who tries to tell you that they know the future is just trying to own it, a spurious kind of manifest destiny.
The harder, deeper truth is that the future is uncharted, that we can't map it till we get there.
But that's OK, because we have so much imagination -- if we use it.
We have deep talents of inventiveness and exploration -- if we apply them.
We are brave enough to invent things we've never seen before.
Lose those skills, and we are adrift.
But hone and develop them, we can make any future we choose.
Thank you.
(Applause)
David Biello: So Victor, what have you been up to?
So this was us in December of last year, for the first time -- the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.
DB: And nobody's seen that before right?
That's just you. VV: No. Well, now everybody else. DB: Who does that?That's just you. VV: No Well, now everybody else. DB: Who does that?Like -- VV: Well, I think everyone has seen the developments in the last 10, 15 years.
You have a bunch of people that have the means to explore outer space, like SpaceX or Blue Origin -- those guys -- and we're going the other direction.
So what we're trying to do with our expedition is to build and prove out a submersible that can go to any point on the bottom of the planet to explore the 60 percent of this planet that is still unexplored.
DB: You need a pretty cool tool to do that, right?
VV: Right.
DB: So like the SpaceX of ocean exploration? VV: Yeah, it's kind of the SpaceX of ocean exploration, but I pilot my own vehicles.
(Laughter) DB: Are you going to take Elon or. . . ?
VV: Yeah, I could take someone down there.
So, Elon, if you're listening, I'll give you a ride in mine if you give me a ride in yours.
(Laughter) DB: So tell us what it's like down there.
I mean, we're talking about a place where the pressure is so intense that it's like putting an Eiffel Tower on your toe.
VV: It's more than that.
It's about 16,000 psi.
So the issue is that we have this titanium sphere that allows us to go down to these extreme depths and come up repeatedly.
That's never been done before.
The Challenger Deep has been dived twice, once in 1960 and once in 2012 by James Cameron, and they went down and came back up and those were experimental craft.
This is the first commercially certified submersible that can go up and down thousands of times with two people, including a scientist.
We're very proud that we took down the deepest-diving British citizen in history just three weeks ago, Dr.
Alan Jamieson of Newcastle University who was down with us on the Java Trench.
DB: So, not too much freaks you out, is what I'm guessing.
VV: Well, it's a lot different to go diving.
If you're claustrophobic, you do not want to be in the submarine.
We go down quite a distance and the missions typically last eight to nine hours in a confined space.
It's very different from the career I had previously which was mountain climbing where you're in open spaces, the wind is whipping, it's very cold.
This is the opposite.
It's much more technical.
It's much more about precision in using the instruments and troubleshooting anything that can go wrong. But if something really goes wrong in the submersible, you're not going to know it.
I like to say I don't trust a lot of things in life, but I do trust titanium, I trust math and I trust finite element analysis, which is how you figure out whether or not things like this can survive these extraordinary pressures and conditions.
DB: And that sphere is so perfectly machined, right?
This is a truly unique craft.
VV: That was the real trick -- is actually building a titanium sphere that was accurate to within . 1 percent of machine. Titanium is a hard metal to work and a lot of people haven't figured it out, but we were very fortunate.
Our extraordinary team was able to make an almost perfect sphere, which when you're subjecting something to pressure, that's the strongest geometry you can have.
When I'm in the submersible and that hatch closes, I'm confident that I'm going to go down and come back up. DB: And that's the thing you double-check -- that the hatch is closed?
VV: There are only two rules in diving a submarine.
Number one is close the hatch securely.
Number two is go back to rule number one.
DB: Alright so, Atlantic Ocean: check.
Southern Ocean: check.
VV: No one has ever dived the Southern Ocean before.
I know why.
It's really, really hostile.
The weather is awful.
The word collision comes to mind.
But we did that one, yes.
Glad that's over -- DB: Yeah -- VV: Thank you.
(Applause) DB: It's like you're racing through it.
And now the Indian Ocean, as Kelly mentioned.
VV: Yeah, that was three weeks ago.
We were fortunate enough to actually solve the mystery. If someone had asked me three weeks ago, "What is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean?
" -- no one really knew.
There were two candidates, one off of Western Australia and one in the Java Trench.
We have this wonderful ship with a brilliant sonar.
We mapped both of them.
We sent landers down to the bottom and verified.
It's actually in the center portion of the Java Trench, which is where no one thought it was.
In fact, every time we've completed one of our major dives, we have to run off to Wikipedia and change it because it's completely wrong.
(Laughter) DB: So it probably takes longer to get down there than the time you're able to spend down there? VV: No, we actually spend quite a bit of time.
I have four days of oxygen supply in the vessel.
DB: Alright, so the bottom of the Indian Ocean.
And this is something that no one besides you has ever seen before -- VV: This is actually imagery from one of our robotic landers.
On the bottom right you can actually see a robust assfish -- that's what it's actually called.
(Laughter) But you can see from the left a creature that's never been seen before.
It's actually a bottom-dwelling jellyfish called a stalked ascidian, and none of them have ever looked like this before. It actually has a small child at the bottom of its stalk, and it just drifted across beautifully.
And so this is extraordinary for us -- (Applause) So what we are hoping -- the main objective of our mission is to build this tool.
This tool is a door, because with this tool, we'll be able to make more of them potentially and take scientists down to do thousands of dives, to open that door to exploration and find things that we had no idea even existed.
DB: And so more people have been to space than the bottom of the ocean.
You're one of three.
You're going to up that number, you're going to give it away. VV: Yeah, three people have dived to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
The USS Trieste in 1960 with two individuals.
If we can do that, we'll have proven the technology and that door will not just go open, it will stay open.
(Applause) DB: Fantastic.
Good luck.
VV: Thank you very much.
DB: Thank you.
VV: Thank you all.
Growing up, my brother and I were surrounded by children from one-child families.
I remember feeling a sense of shame because I had a younger brother. I felt like our family did something wrong for having two children. At the time, I didn't question where this sense of shame and guilt came from.
The message seeped into our minds so much so that I grew up feeling embarrassed for having a younger brother.
With each person I filmed, I saw how their minds and hearts can be influenced by the propaganda, and how their willingness to make sacrifices for the greater good can be twisted into something very dark and tragic.
China is not the only place where this happens. There is no country on earth where propaganda isn't present. And in societies that are supposed to be more open and free than China, it can be even harder to recognize what propaganda looks like.

It hides in plain sight as news reports, TV commercials, political campaigning and in our social media feeds. It works to change our minds without our knowledge. Every society is vulnerable to accepting propaganda as truth, and no society where propaganda replaces the truth can be truly free. Thank you.
I've been a police officer in an urban city for nearly 25 years. That's crazy, right?
And in that time, I've served in every rank, from police officer to police chief.
A few years ago, I noticed something alarming.
Starting in 2014, I started monitoring recruits as they cycled through police academies in the state of New Jersey, and I found that women were failing at rates between 65 and 80 percent, due to varying aspects of the physical fitness test.
I learned that a change in policy now required recruits to pass the fitness exam within 10 short workout sessions.
This had the greatest impact on women.
And many had spent more than 2,000 dollars in fees and equipment just to get kicked out within the first three weeks?
The dire situation in New Jersey led me to examine the status of women in policing across the United States.
I found that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers.
A number that hasn't changed much in the past 20 years.
And they make up just three percent of police chiefs as of 2013, the last time the data was collected. We know that we can improve those rates. Other countries like Canada, Australia and the UK have nearly twice the amount of policewomen.
And New Zealand is steadily marching towards their goal of recruit gender parity by 2021. Other countries are actively working to increase the number of women in policing, because they know of a vast body of research evidence, spanning more than 50 years, detailing the advantages to women in policing.
From that research, we know that policewomen are less likely to use force or to be accused of excessive force.
We know that policewomen are less likely to be named in a lawsuit or a citizen complaint.
We know that the mere presence of a policewoman reduces the use of force among other officers.
And we know that policewomen are met with the same rates of force as their male counterparts, and sometimes more, and yet they're more successful in defusing violent or aggressive behavior overall.
So there are vast advantages to women in policing, and we're losing them to arbitrary fitness standards.
The problem is, the United States has nearly 18,000 police agencies -- 18,000 agencies with wildly varying fitness standards.
We know that a majority of academies rely on a masculine ideal of policing that works to decrease the number of women in policing.
These types of academies overemphasize physical strength, with much less attention spent to subjects like community policing, problem-solving and interpersonal communication skills.
This results in training that does not mirror the realities of policing.
They want to recruit and retain qualified candidates.
You know what else the research finds?
We have the research, we have the science, we have the law.
And in that time, I've served in every rank, from police officer to police chief.
I learned that a change in policy now required recruits to pass the fitness exam within 10 short workout sessions.
This had the greatest impact on women.
The dire situation in New Jersey led me to examine the status of women in policing across the United States.
The problem is, the United States has nearly 18,000 police agencies -- 18,000 agencies with wildly varying fitness standards.
This results in training that does not mirror the realities of policing.
Physical agility is but a small component of police work.
Much of an officer's day is spent mediating interpersonal conflicts.
That's the reality of policing. These are my babies.
And we can reduce the disparity in policing by changing exams that produce disparate outcomes.
The federal courts have stated that men and women simply are not physiologically the same for the purposes of physical fitness programs. And that's based on science.
Respected institutions that law enforcement deeply respects, like the FBI, the US Marshals Service, the DEA and even the US military -- they rigorously test fitness programs to ensure they measure fitness without gender-disparate outcomes. Why is that?
Because recruiting is expensive.
They want to recruit and retain qualified candidates.
You know what else the research finds?
Well-trained women are as capable as their male counterparts in overall fitness, but more importantly, in how they police.
The law-enforcement community is admittedly experiencing a recruitment crisis.
Yet, if they truly want to increase the number of applicants, they can.
We can easily recruit more women and reap all those research benefits by training well-qualified candidates to pass validated, work-related, physiologically-based fitness exams, as required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
We can increase the number of women, we can reduce that gender disparity, by simply changing exams that produce disparate outcomes. We have the tools.
We have the research, we have the science, we have the law.
This, my friends, should be a very easy fix.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Just over a mile away from here, in Edinburgh's Old Town, is Panmure House.
Panmure House was the home of the world-renowned Scottish economist Adam Smith.
In his important work "The Wealth of Nations," Adam Smith argued, amongst many other things, that the measurement of a country's wealth was not just its gold and silver reserves.
It was the totality of the country's production and commerce.
I guess it was one of the earliest descriptions of what we now know today as gross domestic product, GDP.
And my argument today is that it is time for that to change.
You know, what we choose to measure as a country matters.
It really matters, because it drives political focus, it drives public activity.
And against that context, I think the limitations of GDP as a measurement of a country's success are all too obvious.
You know, GDP measures the output of all of our work, but it says nothing about the nature of that work, about whether that work is worthwhile or fulfilling.
It puts a value, for example, on illegal drug consumption, but not on unpaid care.
It values activity in the short term that boosts the economy, even if that activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.
And the purpose of this group is to challenge that focus on the narrow measurement of GDP.
To say that, yes, economic growth matters -- it is important -- but it is not all that is important.
And growth in GDP should not be pursued at any or all cost.
In fact, the argument of that group is that the goal, the objective of economic policy should be collective well-being: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is.
And I'll touch on the policy implications of that in a moment. But I think, particularly in the world we live in today, it has a deeper resonance.
You know, when we focus on well-being, we start a conversation that provokes profound and fundamental questions.
What really matters to us in our lives?
What do we value in the communities we live in?
What kind of country, what kind of society, do we really want to be?
And when we engage people in those questions, in finding the answers to those questions, then I believe that we have a much better chance of addressing the alienation and disaffection from politics that is so prevalent in so many countries across the developed world today.
In policy terms, this journey for Scotland started back in 2007, when we published what we call our National Performance Framework, looking at the range of indicators that we measure ourselves against.
And those indicators are as varied as income inequality, the happiness of children, access to green spaces, access to housing.
None of these are captured in GDP statistics, but they are all fundamental to a healthy and a happy society.
(Applause) And that broader approach is at the heart of our economic strategy, where we give equal importance to tackling inequality as we do to economic competitiveness.
It drives our commitment to fair work, making sure that work is fulfilling and well-paid.
We know from economic transformations of the past that if we're not careful, there are more losers than winners.
The work we're doing here in Scotland is, I think, significant, but we have much, much to learn from other countries.
I mentioned, a moment ago, our partner nations in the Wellbeing network: Iceland and New Zealand.
I started with Adam Smith and "The Wealth of Nations.
It was the totality of the country's production and commerce.
It puts a value, for example, on illegal drug consumption, but not on unpaid care.
In fact, the argument of that group is that the goal, the objective of economic policy should be collective well-being: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is.
And I'll touch on the policy implications of that in a moment. But I think, particularly in the world we live in today, it has a deeper resonance.
(Applause) And that broader approach is at the heart of our economic strategy, where we give equal importance to tackling inequality as we do to economic competitiveness.
The work we're doing here in Scotland is, I think, significant, but we have much, much to learn from other countries.
I mentioned, a moment ago, our partner nations in the Wellbeing network: Iceland and New Zealand.
It's worth noting, and I'll leave it to you to decide whether this is relevant or not, that all three of these countries are currently led by women.
(Applause) They, too, are doing great work.
I started with Adam Smith and "The Wealth of Nations.
" In Adam Smith's earlier work, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," which I think is just as important, he made the observation that the value of any government is judged in proportion to the extent that it makes its people happy.
I think that is a good founding principle for any group of countries focused on promoting well-being.
None of us have all of the answers, not even Scotland, the birthplace of Adam Smith.
But in the world we live in today, with growing divides and inequalities, with disaffection and alienation, it is more important than ever that we ask and find the answers to those questions and promote a vision of society that has well-being, not just wealth, at its very heart.
I want, and I'm determined, that Scotland will also be the country that helps change the focus of countries and governments across the world to put well-being at the heart of everything that we do.
I think we owe that to this generation.
I certainly believe we owe that to the next generation and all those that come after us.
And if we do that, led here from the country of the Enlightenment, then I think we create a better, healthier, fairer and happier society here at home.
And we play our part in Scotland in building a fairer, happier world as well.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
On the 17th of October, 2009, President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives did something unusual.
He held his cabinet meeting underwater.
He literally took his ministers scuba diving, as it were, to warn the world that his country could drown unless we control global warming.
Now I don't know whether he got his message across to the world or not, but he certainly caught mine. I saw a political stunt.
You see, I'm a politician, and I notice these things. And let's be honest, the Maldives are distant from where I come from -- my country is Bhutan -- so I didn't lose any sleep over their impending fate.
Barely two months later, I saw another political stunt.
This time, the prime minister of Nepal, he held his cabinet meeting on Mount Everest.
He took all his ministers all the way up to the base camp of Everest to warn the world that the Himalayan glaciers were melting.
Now did that worry me?
You bet it did.
I live in the Himalayas. But did I lose any sleep over his message? No. I wasn't ready to let a political stunt interfere with my beauty sleep. (Laughter) Now fast-forward 10 years.
In February this year, I saw this report.
This here report basically concludes that one-third of the ice on the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains could melt by the end of the century.
But that's only if, if we are able to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade over preindustrial levels.
Otherwise, if we can't, the glaciers would melt much faster.
1.5 degrees Celsius.
"No way," I thought. Even the Paris Agreement's ambitious targets aimed to limit global warming to two degrees centigrade.
1.5 degrees centigrade is what they call the best-case scenario.
"Now this can't be true," I thought.
The Hindu Kush Himalaya region is the world's third-largest repository of ice, after the North and South Poles.
That's why we are also called the "Third Pole. " There's a lot of ice in the region.
And yes, the glaciers, they are melting.
We know that.
I have been to those in my country.
I've seen them, and yes, they are melting.
They are vulnerable.
"But they can't be that vulnerable," I remember thinking.
But what if they are?
What if our glaciers melt much more quickly than I anticipate?
What if our glaciers are much more vulnerable than previously thought? And what if, as a result, the glacial lakes -- now these are lakes that form when glaciers melt -- what if those lakes burst under the weight of additional water?
And what if those floods cascade into other glacial lakes, creating even bigger outbursts?
That would create unprecedented flash floods in my country.
That would wreck my country.
That would wreak havoc in my country.
That would have the potential to literally destroy our land, our livelihood, our way of life.
So that report caught my attention in ways that political stunts couldn't.
It was put together by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, or ICIMOD, which is based in Nepal.
Scientists and experts have studied our glaciers for decades, and their report kept me awake at night, agonizing about the bad news and what it meant for my country and my people.
So after several sleepless nights, I went to Nepal to visit ICIMOD.
I found a team of highly competent and dedicated scientists there, and here's what they told me.
Number one: the Hindu Kush Himalaya glaciers have been melting for some time now. Take that glacier, for instance.
It's on Mount Everest. As you can see, this once massive glacier has already lost much of its ice.
Number two: the glaciers are now melting much more quickly -- so quickly, in fact, that at just 1.5 degrees centigrade of global warming, one-third of the glaciers would melt.
At two degrees centigrade of global warming, half the glaciers would disappear.
And if current trends were to continue, a full two-thirds of our glaciers would vanish.
Number three: global warming means that our mountains receive more rain and less snow . . . and, unlike snowfall, rain melts ice, which just hurts the health of our glaciers.
Number four: pollution in the region has increased the amount of black carbon that's deposited on our glaciers.
Black carbon is like soot.
Black carbon absorbs heat and just accelerates the melting of glaciers.
To summarize, our glaciers are melting rapidly, and global warming is making them melt much more quickly.
But what does this mean?
It means that the 240 million people who live in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region -- in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and my own beloved country, Bhutan -- these people will be directly affected.
When glaciers melt, when there's more rain and less snow, there will be huge changes in the way water behaves.
There will be more extremes: more intense rain, more flash floods, more landslides, more glacial lake outburst floods.
All this will cause unimaginable destruction in a region that already has some of the poorest people on earth.
But it's not just the people in the immediate region who'll be affected.
People living downstream will also be hit hard.
That's because 10 of their major rivers originate in the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains.
These rivers provide critical water for agriculture and drinking water to more than 1.6 billion people living downstream.
That's one in five humans.
That's why the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains are also called the "water towers of Asia.
" But when glaciers melt, when monsoons turn severe, those rivers will obviously flood, so there will be deluges when water is not required and droughts will be very common, when water is desperately required.
In short, Asia's water tower will be broken, and that will be disastrous for one-fifth of humanity.
Should the rest of the world care?
Should you, for instance, care?
Remember, I didn't care when I heard that the Maldives could disappear underwater.
And that is the crux of the problem, isn't it?
We don't care.
We don't care until we are personally affected.
I mean, we know. We know climate change is real.
We know that we face drastic and dramatic change.
We know that it is coming fast.
Yet most of us act as if everything were normal.
So we must care, all of us, and if you can't care for those who are affected by the melting of glaciers, you should at least care for yourself.
That's because the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains -- the entire region is like the pulse of the planet.
If the region falls sick, the entire planet will eventually suffer.
And right now, with our glaciers melting rapidly, the region is not just sick -- it is crying out for help.
And how will it affect the rest of the world?
One obvious scenario is the potential destabilization caused by tens of millions of climate refugees, who'll be forced to move because they have no or little water, or because their livelihoods have been destroyed by the melting of glaciers.
Another scenario we can't take lightly is the potential of conflict over water and the political destabilization in a region that has three nuclear powers: China, India, Pakistan.
To work together to monitor the health of the glaciers; to work together to shape and implement policies to protect our glaciers, and, by extension, to protect the billions of people who depend on our glaciers.
We have to work together, because thinking globally, acting locally . . . does not work.
We've tried that in Bhutan.
We've made immense sacrifices to act locally . . . and while individual localized efforts will continue to be important, they cannot stand up to the onslaught of climate change.
Our entire region must come together, to work together, to fight climate change together, to make our voices heard together.
And that includes India and China.
They must take the ownership of the fight to protect our glaciers.
Time is running out.
Otherwise, the next time Nepal's cabinet meets on Mount Everest, that spectacular backdrop . . . may look quite different.
He held his cabinet meeting underwater.
Now I don't know whether he got his message across to the world or not, but he certainly caught mine. I saw a political stunt.
This time, the prime minister of Nepal, he held his cabinet meeting on Mount Everest.
I live in the Himalayas. But did I lose any sleep over his message? No. I wasn't ready to let a political stunt interfere with my beauty sleep. (Laughter) Now fast-forward 10 years.

To stand up to climate change, we must work together.
And that includes India and China.
They must step up their game.
They must take the ownership of the fight to protect our glaciers.
And for that, these two countries, these two powerful giants, must reduce their own greenhouse gases, control their pollution, and lead the fight.
Lead the global fight against climate change.
And all that with a renewed sense of urgency.
Only then -- and that, too, only maybe -- will our region and other regions that depend on our glaciers have any chance to avoid major catastrophes.
Time is running out.
We must act together, now.
Otherwise, the next time Nepal's cabinet meets on Mount Everest, that spectacular backdrop . . . may look quite different.
And if that happens, if our glaciers melt, rising sea levels could well drown the Maldives.
And while they can hold their cabinet meetings underwater to send an SOS to the world, their country can keep existing only if their islands keep existing.
The Maldives are still distant, away.
Their islands are distant from where I live.
But now, I pay close attention to what happens out there.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
In 1969 in July, three Americans launched into space.
Now, they went to the surface of the moon, they famously made the great leap for mankind.
Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, they walked on the surface, they planted this flag.
It's rightly celebrated as a moment that in America we say is a triumph.
We think it was this amazing accomplishment.
They didn't just leave behind this flag, though. They also left behind a plaque.
This plaque is a beautiful object, and one that I want to talk to you a little bit about.
First, you might notice that there's two globes, representing all of earth. And then there's this beautiful statement: "We came in peace for all mankind.
" Now, at first, this is just nice poetic language, but it's also set in a typeface that's perfect for this moment.
It seems industrial, it seems engineered.
It also is the best possible name you could come up with for something on the moon: Futura.
Now, I want to talk to you about fonts, and why this typeface is perfect for this moment.
But it's actually more than just ceremonial.
Now, when all of you arrived here today, you actually had to think about fonts.
You might not realize it, but you're all unconscious experts on typography.
Typography is the study of how fonts inhabit our world, they're the visual language of the words we use.
But all of you actually spend hours every day, evaluating fonts.
If you don't believe me, think about how you got here. Each of you had to judge by the signs and maybe even on your phone, which signals to trust and which to ignore.
You were evaluating fonts.
Every street that I walk down, every book that I pick up, every thing that I read is filled with the thing I love.
Now, once you understand the history and what happens with typography, you actually have a history of everything before you.
And this is the typeface Futura.
As previously we've discussed, this is modernism in miniature.
This is a way in which modernism infiltrated this country and became perhaps the most popular, or promiscuous typeface, of the twentieth century.
"Less is more," right, these are the aphorisms of modernism.
And in the visual arts, the same thing happened.
Let's focus on the essentials, focus on the basic shapes, focus on geometry. So Futura actually holds this to its core.
You might notice that the shapes inherent in Futura have circles, squares, triangles.
Thank you. (Applause)
I'm a storyteller, but I'm also a troublemaker.
(Laughter) And I have a habit of asking difficult questions.
It started when I was 10 years old, and my mother, who was raising six children, had no time for them.
At 14, fed up with my increasingly annoying questions, she recommended that I begin writing for the local English-language newspaper in Pakistan, to put my questions out to the entire country, she said.
(Laughter) At 17, I was an undercover investigative journalist.
I don't even think my editor knew just how young I was when I sent in a story that named and shamed some very powerful people.
The men I'd written about wanted to teach me a lesson.
They wanted to shame me and my family.
They spray-painted my name and my family's name with unspeakable profanities across our front gate and around our neighborhood.
And they felt that my father, who was a strict man of tradition, would stop me.
Instead, my father stood in front of me and said, "If you speak the truth, I will stand with you, and so will the world.
" And then he got -- (Applause) And then he got a group of people together and they whitewashed the walls.
(Laughter) I've always wanted my stories to jolt people, to shake them into having difficult conversations.
And I felt that I would be more effective if I did something visual.
And so at 21, I became a documentary filmmaker, turning my camera onto marginalized communities on the front lines in war zones, eventually returning home to Pakistan, where I wanted to document violence against women.
Pakistan is home to 200 million people.
And with its low levels of literacy, film can change the way people perceive issues.
An effective storyteller speaks to our emotions, elicits empathy and compassion, and forces us to look at things differently.
In my country, film had the potential to go beyond cinema. It could change lives.
The issues that I've always wanted to raise -- I've always wanted to hold up a mirror to society -- they've been driven by my barometer of anger.
And my barometer of anger led me, in 2014, to honor killings.
Honor killings take place in many parts of the world, where men punish women who transgress rules made by them: women who choose to marry on their own free will; or women who are looking for a divorce; or women who are suspected of having illicit relationships.
In the rest of the world, honor killings would be known as murder.
I always wanted to tell that story from the perspective of a survivor.
But women do not live to tell their tale and instead end up in unmarked graves.
So one morning when I was reading the newspaper, and I read that a young woman had miraculously survived after being shot in the face by her father and her uncle because she chose to marry a man out of her free will, I knew I had found my storyteller.
Saba was determined to send her father and her uncle to jail, but in the days after leaving the hospital, pressure mounted on her to forgive.
You see, there was a loophole in the law that allowed for victims to forgive perpetrators, enabling them to avoid jail time.
And she was told that she would be ostracized and her family, her in-laws, they would all be shunned from the community, because many felt that her father had been well within his right, given her transgression.
She fought on -- for months.
But on the final day in court, she gave a statement forgiving them.
As filmmakers, we were devastated, because this was not the film that we had set out to make.
In hindsight, had she pressed charges, fought the case and won, hers would have been an exception.
When such a strong woman is silenced, what chance did other women have?
And we began to think about using our film to change the way people perceived honor killings, to impact the loophole in the law.
And then our film was nominated for an Academy Award, and honor killings became headline news, and the prime minister, while sending his congratulations, offered to host the first screening of the film at his office.
Of course, we jumped at the chance, because no prime minister in the history of the country had ever done so.
And then, my name was announced, and I bounded up the steps in flip-flops, because I didn't expect to be onstage.
(Laughter) And I accepted the statue, telling a billion people watching that the prime minister of Pakistan had pledged to change the law, because, of course, that's one way of holding the prime minister accountable.
(Laughter) And -- (Applause) Back home, the Oscar win dominated headline news, and more people joined the fray, asking for the loophole in the law to be closed.
And then in October 2016, after months of campaigning, the loophole was indeed closed.
(Applause) And now men who kill women in the name of honor receive life imprisonment.
(Applause) Yet, the very next day, a woman was killed in the name of honor, and then another and another.
We had impacted legislation, but that wasn't enough.
We needed to take the film and its message to the heartland, to small towns and villages across the country.
You see, for me, cinema can play a very positive role in changing and molding society in a positive direction.
But how would we get to these places?
How would we get to these small towns and villages?
We built a mobile cinema, a truck that would roll through the length and breadth of the country, that would stop in small towns and villages.
We outfitted it with a large screen that would light up the night sky, and we called it "Look But With Love.
" It would give the community an opportunity to come together and watch films in the evening.
We knew we could attract men and children in the mobile cinema.
They would come out and watch.
But what about women?
In these small, rural communities that are segregated, how would we get women to come out?
We had to work with prevailing cultural norms in order to do so, and so we built a cinema inside the cinema, outfitting it with seats and a screen where women could go inside and watch without fearing or being embarrassed or harassment.
We began to introduce everyone to films that opened up their minds to competing worldviews, encouraging children to build critical thinking so that they could ask questions.
And we expanded our scope beyond honor killings, talking about income inequality, the environment, talking about ethnic relations, religious tolerance and compassion.
We were surprised that we were welcomed in so many of the places that we went to.
Many of the towns had never seen television or social media, and they were eager for their children to learn.
But there was also pushback and blowback with the ideas that we were bringing with us.
Two members of our mobile cinema team resigned because of threats from villages.
And in one of the villages that we were screening in, they shut it down and said they didn't want the women to know about their rights.
But we've come across so many of these heroes on our journey.
In another town, where the men said that only they could watch and the women had to stay home, a community elder got up, got a group of people together, had a discussion, and then both men and women sat down to watch together.
We are documenting what we are doing.
We talk to people.
We adapt.
We change the lineup of films.
When we show men films that show perpetrators of violence behind bars, we want to hit home the fact that if men are violent, there will be repercussions.
But we also show films where men are seen as championing women, because we want to encourage them to take on those roles.
For women, when we show them films in which they are heads of state or where they are lawyers and doctors and in leadership positions, we talk to them and encourage them to step into those roles.
We are changing the way people in these villages interact, and we're taking our learnings into other places.
Recently, a group contacted us and wants to take our mobile cinema to Bangladesh and Syria, and we're sharing our learnings with them.
We feel it's really important to take what we are doing and spread it across the world.
In small towns and villages across Pakistan, men are changing the way they interact with women, children are changing the way they see the world, one village at a time, through cinema.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'd like to tell you today about an orca named Tahlequah.
Tahlequah is also known as J35 to scientists, because she swims with the J Pod in the Salish Sea.
These are the waters off of British Columbia and Washington State. Now, last year, in July 2018, she was well along in her 17-month pregnancy, and scientists were very excited because no baby had survived in this pod for three long years.
Now, orcas are also known as killer whales. They're profoundly social and profoundly intelligent beings.
And scientists are very interested in their behavior, because in their social networks, they share habits, information and even affection. They create true cultures of the ocean.
But this pod has been in trouble.
The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor has been way down in the region, and pollution has been up.
But on July 24th, Tahlequah gave birth to a daughter, and scientists were so excited by this development.
But unfortunately, the same day -- in fact, shortly after birth -- the calf died.
Well, what happened next electrified animal lovers across the world, because Tahlequah refused to let her baby slip off into the water.
She kept it on her body and she swam with it.
If it did fall off, she would dive and rescue it, and she battled stiff currents to do this.
Now, she kept this behavior up for 17 days, and during this time, she swam over 1,000 miles.
At that point, she let the little baby slip off into the water.
So today, Tahlequah swims on with the J Pod, but her grief still moves me.
And I do believe that "grief" is the right word to use.
I believe that grief is the right word to use for numerous animals who mourn the dead.
They may be friends or mates or relatives.
Because these visible cues, these behavioral cues, tell us something about an animal's emotional state.
Now, for the last seven years, I've been working to document examples of animal grief -- in birds, in mammals, in domesticated animals and in wild animals -- and I believe in the reality of animal grief.
Now, I say it this way because I need to acknowledge to you right up front that not all scientists agree with me.
And part of the reason, I think, is because of what I call the "a-word.
" The a-word is anthropomorphism, and historically, it's been a big deterrent to recognizing animal emotions.
So, anthropomorphism is when we project onto other animals our capacities or our emotions.
And we can all probably think of examples of this.
Let's say we have a friend who tells us, "My cat understands everything I say.
" Or, "My dog, he's so sweet.
he ran right across the yard this morning towards a squirrel, and I know he just wants to play.
" Well, maybe.
Or maybe not.
I'm skeptical about claims like those.
But animal grief is different, because we're not trying to read an animal's mind.
We're looking at visible cues of behavior and trying to interpret them with some meaning.
Now, it's true -- scientists often push back at me, and they'll say, "Ah, look, the animal might be stressed, or maybe the animal's just confused because his or her routine has been disrupted.
" But I think that this overworry about anthropomorphism misses a fundamental point.
And that is that animals can care very deeply for each other, maybe they even love each other.
And when they do, a survivor's heart can be pierced by a death.
Let's face it: if we deny evolutionary continuity, we are really missing out on embracing part of ourselves.
So yes, I believe in the reality of animal grief, and I also think that if we recognize it, we can make the world a better place for animals, a kinder place for animals.
So let me tell you a little bit more about animal grief.
I'm going to start in Kenya.
You see here there's an elephant named Eleanor who came one day with bruised legs, and she collapsed.
You see on the left that another female named Grace came to her right away and, using her own trunk, propped her up, tried to get her up on her feet.
And she did succeed, but then Eleanor collapsed again.
At this point, Grace became visibly distressed, and she prodded the body, and she vocalized. Eleanor collapsed again, and unfortunately, she did die.
What you see on the right is a female from another family named Maui, who came after the death, and she stayed at the body.
She held a vigil there, and she even rocked in distress over the body.
So the scientists watching the elephants kept close observation on Eleanor's body for seven days.
And during those seven days, a parade of elephants came from five different families.
Now, some were just curious, but others carried out behaviors that I really believe should be classified as grief.
So what does grief look like?
And I can explain this to you by talking about two ducks named Harper and Kohl.
So we're into birds now.
So Harper and Kohl were raised at a foie gras factory, and they were treated cruelly.
Foie gras does involve force-feeding of birds.
So this hurt their bodies, and their spirits were not in good shape, either.
But thankfully, they were rescued by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York.
And for four years, they stabilized, and they were fast friends.
They often took themselves to a small pond on the property.
Then, Kohl started to have really intractable pain in his legs, and it was clear to the sanctuary that he had to be euthanized humanely, and he was. But then the sanctuary workers did a brilliant thing, because they brought Harper to the body to see.
And at first, Harper prodded the body of his friend, but then he laid himself over it, and he stayed there for over an hour with his friend.
And in the weeks after, he had a hard time.
He would go back to that same pond where he had been with Kohl, and he didn't want any other friends.
And within two months, he died as well.
Now, I'm happy to say that not all grieving animals have this sorrowful outcome.
Last summer, I flew to Boston to visit my adult daughter, Sarah. I was with my husband Charlie.
I really needed a break from work.
But I succumbed, and I checked my work email.
You know how that is.
And there was a communication about a dejected donkey. Now, as an anthropologist, this wasn't what I expected, but there it was, and I'm glad I read it.
Because a donkey named Lena had gone to another farm sanctuary, this one in Alberta, Canada, as the only donkey there, and had trouble making friends for that reason.
But she eventually did make friends with an older horse named Jake, and for three years they were inseparable.
But the reason the email came was that Jake, at age 32, the horse, had become gravely ill and had to be put down, and this is what was going on.
This is Lena standing on Jake's grave.
She didn't want to come in at night.
She didn't want to come in for food.
She didn't want to come in for water.
She pawed at the grave, she brayed in distress, and there she stood.
So we talked and we brainstormed.
What do you do for an animal like this?
And we talked about the role of time, of extra love and kindness from people and of urging her to make a new friend.
And here's where her trajectory does diverge from that of Harper the duck, because she did make a new friend, and sanctuary workers wrote back and said it worked out well. Now sometimes, scientists supplement observation with hormonal analysis.
There's an example of a group of scientists in Botswana, who took fecal material from baboons and compared two different groups.
The first group were females who had witnessed a predator attack and lost someone in that attack, and the second group were females who had witnessed an attack but had not lost someone.
And the stress hormones were way up in that first group.
But here's the thing: the scientists didn't just call them "stressed baboons," they called them "bereaved baboons," and in part, that's because of the observations that they made.
For example, this mother-daughter pair were very close, and then the daughter was killed by a lion.
The mother removed herself from all her friends, from her grooming networks, and just stayed by herself for weeks -- bereavement -- and she then slowly recovered.
So we have bereaved baboons.
Will science tell us someday about bereaved bees?
Will we hear about frogs who mourn?
I don't think so, and I think the reason is because animals really need one-to-one, close relationships for that to happen.
I also know that circumstance matters, and personality matters.
I have documented cats and dogs who grieve, our companion animals, but I also interacted with a woman who was extremely bothered because her dog wasn't grieving.
She said to me, "The first dog in the house has died.
The second animal does not seem concerned, the second dog.
What is wrong with him?
" (Laughter) And as I listened to her, I realized that this dog was now the only animal in the household, and as far as he was concerned, that was a pretty good deal.
So circumstances matter.
Now, in any case, animals are not going to grieve exactly like we do.
We have human creativity.
We paint our grief, dance our grief, write our grief.
We also can grieve for people we've never met, across space and time.
I felt this strongly when I went to Berlin and I stood at the Holocaust Memorial.
Animals don't grieve exactly like we do, but this doesn't mean that their grief isn't real.
It is real, and it's searing, and we can see it if we choose.
Now, I've lost both my parents.
I lost a very dear friend at a young age from AIDS.
I believe most likely most of you here have lost someone.
And I have found it a genuine comfort, a solace, to know that we aren't the only beings on this earth who feel love and grief.
And I think this is important.
So we could look at joy, sadness, even hope.
(Applause) Thank you.
And we can look at our closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, and know yes they grieve, they feel their lives, so they don't deserve to be confined in highly invasive biomedical experiments year after year.
And, you know -- (Applause) the ducks Harper and Kohl, they tell us something too.
They help us connect the dots and realize that what we eat affects how animals live.
And it's not just foie gras, and it's not just ducks.
We can think about pigs and chickens and cows in factory farms, and we can know.
I can tell you the science is real that these animals feel, too.
So every single time we choose a plant-based meal, we are contributing to reducing animal suffering.
(Applause) So yes, I believe in the reality of animal grief.
I believe in the reality of animal love, and I think it is time for us humans to recognize that we don't own these things.
And when we see that, we have an opportunity to make the world so much better for animals, a kinder world, a gentler world, and along the way, we might just save ourselves, too. Thank you so much.
(Applause) Thank you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I met 273 start-up founders last year.
And each one was looking for money.
As a tech investor, my goal was to sort through everyone that I met and make a quick determination about which ones had the potential to make something really big.
But what makes a great founder?
This is a question I ask myself daily.
Some venture capitalists place bets based on a founder's previous background. Did they go to an Ivy League school?
Have they worked at a blue-chip company?
Have they built out a big vision before?
Effectively, how smart is this person?
Other VCs asses a founder's emotional quotient, or EQ. How well will this person build teams and build rapport across customers and clients?
I have a different methodology to assess start-up founders, though, and it's not complicated.
I look for signs of one specific trait.
Not IQ, not EQ.
It's adaptability: how well a person reacts to the inevitability of change, and lots of it.
That's the single most important determinant for me. I subscribe to the belief that adaptability itself is a form of intelligence, and our adaptability quotient, or AQ, is something that can be measured, tested and improved.
AQ isn't just useful for start-up founders, however. I think it's increasingly important for all of us.
Because the world is speeding up.
We know that the rate of technological change is accelerating, which is forcing our brains to react.
Whether you're navigating changing job conditions brought on by automation, shifting geopolitics in a more globalized world, or simply changing family dynamics and personal relationships.
Each of us, as individuals, groups, corporations and even governments are being forced to grapple with more change than ever before in human history.
So, how do we assess our adaptability?
I use three tricks when meeting with founders. Here's the first. Think back to your most recent job interview. What kind of questions were you asked?
Probably some variation of, "Tell me about a time when," right?
Instead, to interview for adaptability, I like to ask "what if" questions.
What if your main revenue stream were to dry up overnight?
What if a heat wave prevented every single customer from being able to visit your store?
Asking "what if," instead of asking about the past, forces the brain to simulate. To picture multiple possible versions of the future. The strength of that vision, as well as how many distinct scenarios someone can conjure, tells me a lot.
Practicing simulations is a sort of safe testing ground for improving adaptability.
Instead of testing how you take in and retain information, like an IQ test might, it tests how you manipulate information, given a constraint, in order to achieve a specific goal. The second trick that I use to assess adaptability in founders is to look for signs of unlearning.
Active unlearners seek to challenge what they presume to already know, and instead, override that data with new information.
Kind of like a computer running a disk cleanup.
Take the example of Destin Sandlin, who programed his bicycle to turn left when he steered it right and vice versa.
He called this his Backwards Brain Bike, and it took him nearly eight months just to learn how to ride it kind of, sort of normally.
The fact that Destin was able to unlearn his regular bike in favor of a new one, though, signals something awesome about our adaptability.
It's not fixed.
Instead, each of us has the capacity to improve it, through dedication and hard work.
On the last page of Gandhi's autobiography, he wrote, "I must reduce myself to zero.
" At many points in his very full life, he was still seeking to return to a beginner's mindset, to zero.
To unlearn. In this way, I think it's pretty safe to say Gandhi had a high AQ score.
(Laughter) The third and final trick that I use to assess a founder's adaptability is to look for people who infuse exploration into their life and their business.
There's a sort of natural tension between exploration and exploitation.
And collectively, all of us tend to overvalue exploitation. Here's what I mean.
" The other man in the meeting, however, turned out to be Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix. In 2018, Netflix brought in 15.8 billion dollars, while Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010, directly 10 years after that meeting.
The Blockbuster CEO was too focused on exploiting his already successful business model, so much so that he couldn't see around the next corner.
In that way, his previous success became the enemy of his adaptability potential. For the founders that I work with, I frame exploration as a state of constant seeking.
To never fall too far in love with your wins but rather continue to proactively seek out what might kill you next. When I first started exploring adaptability, the thing I found most exciting is that we can improve it.
Each of us has the capacity to become more adaptable.
But think of it like a muscle: it's got to be exercised.
And don't get discouraged if it takes a while.
Remember Destin Sandlin?
We're entering a future where IQ and EQ both matter way less than how fast you're able to adapt.
So I hope that these tools help you to raise your own AQ.
Thank you.

I am an astrodynamicist -- you know, like that guy Rich Purnell in the movie "The Martian.
" And it's my job to study and predict motion of objects in space.
Currently we track about one percent of hazardous objects on orbit -- hazardous to services like location, agriculture, banking, television and communications, and soon -- very soon -- even the internet itself.
Now these services are not protected from, roughly, half a million objects the size of a speck of paint all the way to a school bus in size.
A speck of paint, traveling at the right speed, impacting one of these objects, could render it absolutely useless.
But we can't track things as small as a speck of paint.
We can only track things as small as say, a smartphone.
So of this half million objects that we should be concerned about, we can only track about 26,000 of these objects. And of these 26,000, only 2,000 actually work.
Everything else is garbage.
That's a lot of garbage.
To make things a little bit worse, most of what we launch into orbit never comes back.
We send the satellite in orbit, it stops working, it runs out of fuel, and we send something else up . . . and then we send up something else . . . and then something else.
Now these things are not just randomly scattered in orbit.
It turns out that given the curvature of space-time, there are ideal locations where we put some of these satellites -- think of these as space highways.
Very much like highways on earth, these space highways can only take up a maximum capacity of traffic to sustain space-safe operations.
Unlike highways on earth, there are actually no space traffic rules.
None whatsoever, OK? Wow. What could possibly go wrong with that?
(Laughter) Now, what would be really nice is if we had something like a space traffic map, like a Waze for space that I could look up and see what the current traffic conditions are in space, maybe even predict these.
The problem with that, however, is that ask five different people, "What's going on in orbit?
Where are things going?
" and you're probably going to get 10 different answers.
Why is that?
It's because information about things on orbit is not commonly shared either.
So what if we had a globally accessible, open and transparent space traffic information system that can inform the public of where everything is located to try to keep space safe and sustainable?
And what if the system could be used to form evidence-based norms of behavior -- these space traffic rules?
So I developed ASTRIAGraph, the world's first crowdsourced, space traffic monitoring system at the University of Texas at Austin.
ASTRIAGraph combines multiple sources of information from around the globe -- government, industry and academia -- and represents this in a common framework that anybody can access today.
Well, in that case, that's what your space traffic map would look like.
That looks significantly different.
(Applause and cheers)I am an astrodynamicist -- you know, like that guy Rich Purnell in the movie "The Martian.
" And it's my job to study and predict motion of objects in space.

So I developed ASTRIAGraph, the world's first crowdsourced, space traffic monitoring system at the University of Texas at Austin.
But back to my problem of space traffic map: What if you only had information from the US government?
Well, in that case, that's what your space traffic map would look like.
But what do the Russians think?
That looks significantly different.
Who's right?
Who's wrong?
What should I believe?
What could I trust?
This is part of the issue.
In the absence of this framework to monitor space-actor behavior, to monitor activity in space -- where these objects are located -- to reconcile these inconsistencies and make this knowledge commonplace, we actually risk losing the ability to use space for humanity's benefit.
Thank you very much.
(Applause and cheers)
My name is Glenn, I'm 25, and I don't know my real last name.
It's not uncommon in America.
Most black people in this country are walking around with a slave owner's last name.
Black history has been systemically erased and altered for centuries.
As I give this talk, there are more than 700 Confederate monuments standing nationwide.
These were erected to honor Confederate soldiers who fought to maintain slavery -- mostly in the South -- from the 1890s to the 1950s, when Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation were in full effect.
To this day, black people are forced to confront monuments of slaveholders in our public spaces.
These memorials are a physical representation of a system that is actively working to define whose lives matter and whose lives do not.
If we are going to disrupt the narrative, we have to start at the origin.
Genocide, slavery and patriarchy started in the Americas with Christopher Columbus.
Most people in the United States know about his voyage of 1492. Fewer people know that an estimated 250,000 indigenous Arawaks were wiped out within two years of his arrival.
Even fewer people know that Columbus admitted in a letter written to Doña Juana de la Torre that "nine and 10-year-old girls were in high demand, and for girls of all ages a good price must be paid.
" Yet New York City's Columbus Circle has had him perched 76 feet high next to Central Park since 1892. I started Movers and Shakers, a nonprofit, to get the statue removed.
Movers and Shakers is a group of activists, artists, educators and engineers focused on using immersive technology to highlight the narratives of the oppressed.
In our campaign to knock Columbus off his pedestal, we engaged in a visually provocative form of activism.
We created an augmented reality installation on the true story of Christopher Columbus and used it to host teach-ins in Columbus Circle and Times Square.
Many see the controversy around the statue as tension between the Italian-American community and the indigenous community.
The reality is that most black people are here in this country as a result of the atrocities that were kicked off by Christopher Columbus.
So we ended up holding a slave auction in Union Square to tie into the genesis of the transatlantic slave trade.
I ran the New York City Marathon in chains to spread awareness to this issue.
I was also arrested in Giants Stadium for hosting a slave reenactment at their football team's home opener.
We gave it everything that we had, but in the end, New York City decided to keep the statue, and New York State unanimously voted to make it a landmark.
The news was devastating, but it opened up another door.
We realized that with augmented reality you don't need permission from the government to put up a monument or to make a statement.
You can just do it.
So New York City right now currently has more than 150 statues of men and six of women and currently acknowledges slaveholders in public spaces as well.
So we decided, why not just put up a bunch of AR monuments of women and people of color throughout the city?
Typically, monuments are created to commemorate the achievements of the deceased, but with augmented reality, we can reroute the rules.
We started with sports.
Colin Kaepernick.
He was the starting quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, and he wanted to use his platform to highlight the injustice of systemic racism.
So he consulted a Green Beret on the most respectful way to do this, and he decided to take a knee during the national anthem.
He lost his contract with the 49ers, he was blackballed by every NFL owner, he was criticized by millions and even the president of the United States decided to insult him.
It may be decades before Colin Kaepernick is adequately respected for his courage, so our team decided to do this.
Now anyone that walks by Trump Tower can see Colin Kaepernick take a knee in augmented reality, and there's nothing they can do about it.
(Laughter) Representation matters.
Serena Williams proved to the world that a black girl from Compton can dominate a sport that's traditionally played at exclusive country clubs.
Let's celebrate her now.
Jackie Robinson.
He broke the color barrier and empowered many black athletes to play in Major League Baseball.
We're going to take this monument of him and put it in Ebbets Field so that anyone can see him swing for the fences in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn.
Our vision is a "Pokémon Go" for a contextualized history.
Augmented reality can also be used as a tool to support organizations that are fighting against systemic oppression.
In 2019 we will release our free smartphone app with augmented reality monuments and content.
You can take your smartphone and hold it over any one-dollar bill and see a scene in augmented reality that illustrates the injustice of cash bail.
You can then click on the screen and be directed to the donation page of The Bail Project, a fund that raises money for people who cannot afford bail.
With augmented reality, we the people have the power to highlight the narratives of the oppressed when institutions refuse to do so.
We can use this tool to highlight the systemic implications of erasing someone's history.
And more concretely, we can use this technology as a way to support initiatives that are fighting against systemic racism.
With AR, we have the power to reimagine a world that prioritizes justice over oppression.
Thank you.
(Applause and cheers)
My name is Jon Gray.
They call me "The Dishwasher.
" I cofounded Ghetto Gastro, a Bronx-based collective that works at the intersection of food, design and art.
We create experiences that challenge people's perceptions of the Bronx, the place that I call home.
It's a funny thing. I just touched down in Vancouver from Paris a few days ago.
We took over the Place Vendôme with the Bronx Brasserie.
Oui oui, chérie. (Laughter) It's wild, because in Paris, they have this saying, "le Bronx," which means something is in disarray or a problem.
That's the Place Vendôme.
We shut it down one time.
(Laughter) This lingo came into play when the Bronx was burning, and movies like "The Warriors" and "Fort Apache" still make an impression.
Some may disagree, but I believe the Bronx was designed to fail.
The power broker was a joker. Robert Moses, instead of parting the Red Sea, he parted the Bronx with a six-lane highway and redlined my community.
My great-grandparents had a home on Featherbed Lane, and contrary to the name, they couldn't get a good night's rest due to the constant blasting and drilling that was necessary to build the cross-Bronx expressway a block away.
I consider these policy decisions design crimes.
(Applause) Being the resilient people that we are uptown, out of the systematic oppression hip-hop culture rose from the rubble and the ashes like a phoenix.
Hip-hop is now a trillion-dollar industry, but this economic activity doesn't make it back to the Bronx or communities like it.
Let's take it back to 1986. I was born in the heart of the AIDS crisis, the crack epidemic and the War on Drugs.
The only thing that trickled down from Reaganomics was ghettonomics: pain, prison and poverty.
I was raised by brilliant, beautiful and accomplished black women.
Even so, my pops wasn't in the picture, and I couldn't resist the allure of the streets.
Like Biggie said, you're either slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot.
Don't get it twisted, my jumper was wet.
(Laughter) My shit was wet.
(Applause) But when I turned 15, I started selling weed, I didn't finish high school, the New York Board of Education banned me from all of those, but I did graduate to selling cocaine when I turned 18. I did well.
That was until I got jammed up, caught a case, when I was 20. I was facing 10 years.
I posted bail, signed up at the Fashion Institute, I applied the skills that I learned in the streets to start my own fashion brand.
My lawyer peeked my ambition, so he suggested that the judge grant me a suspended sentence.
For once in my life, a suspension was a good thing.
(Laughter) Over the course of two years and many court dates, my case got dismissed.
Both of my brothers have done jail time, so escaping the clutches of the prison industrial system didn't seem realistic to me.
Right now, one of my brothers is facing 20 years.
My mother put in great effort in taking me out to eat, making sure we visited museums and traveled abroad, basically exposing me to as much culture as she could.
I remembered how as a kid, I used to take over the dinner table and order food for everybody.
Breaking bread has always allowed me to break the mold and connect with people.
Me and my homie Les, we grew up on the same block in the Bronx, two street dudes.
He happened to be a chef.
We always discussed the possibility of doing something in the food game for the benefit of our neighborhood.
Les had just won the food show "Chopped.
" Our homie Malcolm was gearing up to run a pastry kitchen at Noma, yeah, world's best Noma in Copenhagen, you know the vibes.
My man P had just finished training in I-I-Italy, Milano to be exact.
We decided the world needed some Bronx steasoning on it, so we mobbed up and formed Ghetto Gastro.
(Applause) While I'm aware our name makes a lot of people uncomfortable, for us "ghetto" means home.
Similar to the way someone in Mumbai or Nairobi might use the word "slum," it's to locate our people and to indict the systems of neglect that created these conditions.
(Applause) So what is Ghetto Gastro?
Ultimately, it's a movement and a philosophy.
We view the work we do as gastrodiplomacy, using food and finesse to open borders and connect culture.
Last year in Tokyo, we did a Caribbean patty, we do jerk wagyu beef, shio kombu.
We remixed the Bronx classic with the Japanese elements.
And for Kwanzaa, we had to pay homage to our Puerto Ricans, and we did a coconut charcoal cognac coquito.
Dímelo!
(Laughter) This here is our Black Power waffle with some gold leaf syrup.
Make sure you don't slip on the drip.
(Laughter) Here we got the 36 Brix plant-based velato.
Strawberry fields, you know the deal.
Compressed watermelon, basil seeds, a little bit of strawberries up there.
Back to the Bronx Brasserie, you know we had to hit them in the head with that caviar and cornbread.
(Laughter) (Applause) We also practice du-rag diplomacy.
(Laughter) Because, we don't edit who we are when we do our thing.
Due to our appearance, we often get mistaken for rappers or athletes.
How about now?
(Applause) So you see, we've been bringing the Bronx to the world but now we focus on bringing the world to the Bronx. We just opened our spot, an idea kitchen where we make and design products, create content -- (Music) and host community events.
The intention is to build financial capital and creative capital in our hood.
We're also collaborating with world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura on a refettorio in the Bronx.
A refettorio is a design-focused soup kitchen and community center.
You see the vibes.
(Applause) At Ghetto Gastro, we don't run from the word "ghetto," and we don't run from the ghetto.
Because at the end of the day, Ghetto Gastro is about showing you what we already know: the hood is good.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
Hello. I'd like to introduce you to someone.
This is Jomny.
That's "Jonny" but spelled accidentally with an "m," in case you were wondering, because we're not all perfect.
Jomny is an alien who has been sent to earth with a mission to study humans.
Jomny is feeling lost and alone and far from home, and I think we've all felt this way. Or, at least I have.
I wrote this story about this alien at a moment in my life when I was feeling particularly alien.
I had just moved to Cambridge and started my doctoral program at MIT, and I was feeling intimidated and isolated and very much like I didn't belong.
But I had a lifeline of sorts.
See, I was writing jokes for years and years and sharing them on social media, and I found that I was turning to doing this more and more.
Now, for many people, the internet can feel like a lonely place.
It can feel like this, a big, endless, expansive void where you can constantly call out to it but no one's ever listening.
But I actually found a comfort in speaking out to the void.
I found, in sharing my feelings with the void, eventually the void started to speak back.
And it turns out that the void isn't this endless lonely expanse at all, but instead it's full of all sorts of other people, also staring out into it and also wanting to be heard.
Now, there have been many bad things that have come from social media.
I'm not trying to dispute that at all.
To be online at any given point is to feel so much sadness and anger and violence.
It can feel like the end of the world. Yet, at the same time, I'm conflicted because I can't deny the fact that so many of my closest friends are people that I had met originally online.
And I think that's partly because there's this confessional nature to social media.
It can feel like you are writing in this personal, intimate diary that's completely private, yet at the same time you want everyone in the world to read it.
And I think part of that, the joy of that is that we get to experience things from perspectives from people who are completely different from ourselves, and sometimes that's a nice thing.
For example, when I first joined Twitter, I found that so many of the people that I was following were talking about mental health and going to therapy in ways that had none of the stigma that they often do when we talk about these issues in person.
Through them, the conversation around mental health was normalized, and they helped me realize that going to therapy was something that would help me as well.
Now, for many people, it sounds like a scary idea to be talking about all these topics so publicly and so openly on the internet.
I feel like a lot of people think that it is a big, scary thing to be online if you're not already perfectly and fully formed.
But I think the internet can be actually a great place to not know, and I think we can treat that with excitement, because to me there's something important about sharing your imperfections and your insecurities and your vulnerabilities with other people.
(Laughter) Now, when someone shares that they feel sad or afraid or alone, for example, it actually makes me feel less alone, not by getting rid of any of my loneliness but by showing me that I am not alone in feeling lonely.
And as a writer and as an artist, I care very much about making this comfort of being vulnerable a communal thing, something that we can share with each other.
I'm excited about externalizing the internal, about taking those invisible personal feelings that I don't have words for, holding them to the light, putting words to them, and then sharing them with other people in the hopes that it might help them find words to find their feelings as well.
Sometimes that takes the form of a short story, sometimes that takes the form of a cute book of illustrations, for example.
And sometimes that takes the form of a silly joke that I'll throw on the internet.
For example, a few months ago, I posted this app idea for a dog-walking service where a dog shows up at your door and you have to get out of the house and go for a walk.
(Laughter) If there are app developers in the audience, please find me after the talk.
Or, I like to share every time I feel anxious about sending an email. When I sign my emails "Best," it's short for "I am trying my best," which is short for "Please don't hate me, I promise I'm trying my best!
" Or my answer to the classic icebreaker, if I could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, I would.
I am very lonely.
(Laughter) And I find that when I post things like these online, the reaction is very similar.
People come together to share a laugh, to share in that feeling, and then to disburse just as quickly.
(Laughter) Yes, leaving me once again alone.
But I think sometimes these little gatherings can be quite meaningful.
For example, when I graduated from architecture school and I moved to Cambridge, I posted this question: "How many people in your life have you already had your last conversation with?
" And I was thinking about my own friends who had moved away to different cities and different countries, even, and how hard it would be for me to keep in touch with them.
But other people started replying and sharing their own experiences. Somebody talked about a family member they had a falling out with. Someone talked about a loved one who had passed away quickly and unexpectedly.
Someone else talked about their friends from school who had moved away as well.
But then something really nice started happening.
And eventually, we got this little tiny microcommunity. It felt like this support group formed of all sorts of people coming together.
And I think every time we post online, every time we do this, there's a chance that these little microcommunities can form.
There's a chance that all sorts of different creatures can come together and be drawn together.
And sometimes, through the muck of the internet, you get to find a kindred spirit.
Sometimes that's in the reading the replies and the comments sections and finding a reply that is particularly kind or insightful or funny. Sometimes that's in going to follow someone and seeing that they already follow you back.
And sometimes that's in looking at someone that you know in real life and seeing the things that you write and the things that they write and realizing that you share so many of the same interests as they do, and that brings them closer together to you.
Sometimes, if you're lucky, you get to meet another alien.
[when two aliebns find each other in a strange place, it feels a litle more like home] But I am worried, too, because as we all know, the internet for the most part doesn't feel like this.
We all know that for the most part, the internet feels like a place where we misunderstand each other, where we come into conflict with each other, where there's all sorts of confusion and screaming and yelling and shouting, and it feels like there's too much of everything.
It feels like chaos, and I don't know how to square away the bad parts with the good, because as we know and as we've seen, the bad parts can really, really hurt us.
But still, and maybe probably unfortunately, I'm still drawn to these online spaces, as many others are, because sometimes it just feels like that's where all the people are. And I feel silly and stupid sometimes for valuing these small moments of human connection in times like these.
And they are these tiny, temporary sanctuaries that show us that we are not as alone as we think we are. And so yes, even though life is bad and everyone's sad and one day we're all going to die -- [look. life is bad. everyones sad.
We're all gona die, but i alredy bought this inflatable bouncey castle so are u gona take Ur shoes off or not] I think the inflatable metaphorical bouncy castle in this case is really our relationships and our connections to other people.
Everybody came together to hold hands.
And in these dangerous and unsure times, in the midst of it all, I think the thing that we have to hold on to is other people.
And I know that is a small thing made up of small moments, but I think it is one tiny, tiny sliver of light in all the darkness.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
Deep in our solar system, a new era of space exploration is unfolding.
Beneath the thick ice of Europa, in the vapor plumes on Enceladus, and within the methane lakes of Titan, astrobiologists are on the hunt for extraterrestrial life.
We’ve honed in on these three moons because each is an ‘ocean world,’ an environment that contains a liquid ocean– and liquid can support the formation of life.
Living organisms have to be able to grow, reproduce, and feed themselves, among other things.
All of those functions require the formation of complex molecules from more basic components.
Liquids such as water allow chemical compounds to remain in suspension instead of sinking under the force of gravity.
This enables them to interact frequently in a 3-dimensional space and, in the right conditions, go through chemical reactions that lead to the formation of living matter.
That alone isn’t enough; the small but complex biomolecules that we’re familiar with are sensitive to temperature— too hot or cold, and they won’t mix.
Liquid water has an additional advantage in that it’s relatively temperature-stable, meaning it can insulate molecules against large shifts in heat.
On Earth, these and other conditions in aquatic environments may have supported the emergence of life billions of years ago.
Tantalizingly, the same could be true in other parts of our solar system, like these three icy moons.
Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter, is probably the most intriguing ocean world.
Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker than Mount Everest, there exists a liquid ocean as much as 100 kilometers deep.
Astrobiologists think this hidden ocean could harbor life.
Thanks to the Galileo probe, we can deduce that its potential salt content is similar to that of some lakes on Earth.
But most of its characteristics will be a mystery until we can explore it further.
Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that might have the right conditions for life.
For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of ice that’s small enough to nestle within the surface area of the Gulf of Mexico.
Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an ocean deep under the ice.
But Enceladus also has geysers that frequently vent water vapor and tiny ice grains into space.
Astrobiologists are curious about whether these geysers are connected to the ocean below.
They hope to send a probe to test whether the geysers’ plumes of vapor contain life-enabling material from that hidden sea.
Although it’s the best known substance for nurturing life, water isn’t necessarily the only medium that can support living things.
Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere containing methane and many other organic molecules.
Its clouds condense and rain onto Titan’s surface, sustaining lakes and seas full of liquid methane.
This compound’s particular chemistry means it’s not as supportive a medium as water.
But, paired with the high quantities of organic material that also rain down from the sky, these bodies of liquid methane could possibly support unfamiliar life forms.
This would make it difficult to directly observe from a great distance, so astrobiologists seek clues called biosignatures.
Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral traces left behind by living things.
And finding any biosignatures will be challenging for many reasons.
One of the biggest concerns is to make sure we sterilize our probes extremely thoroughly.
Otherwise we could accidentally contaminate ocean worlds with Earth’s own bacteria, which could destroy alien life.
Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are just three of possibly many ocean worlds that we could explore.
We already know of several other candidates in our solar system, including Jupiter’s moons Callisto and Ganymede, Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto.
If there’s this much potential for life to exist in our own tiny solar system, what unimagined secrets might the rest of the universe contain?
I'm going to tell you about the most amazing machines in the world and what we can now do with them.
Proteins, some of which you see inside a cell here, carry out essentially all the important functions in our bodies.
Proteins digest your food, contract your muscles, fire your neurons and power your immune system.
Everything that happens in biology -- almost -- happens because of proteins.
Proteins are linear chains of building blocks called amino acids.
Nature uses an alphabet of 20 amino acids, some of which have names you may have heard of.
In this picture, for scale, each bump is an atom.
Chemical forces between the amino acids cause these long stringy molecules to fold up into unique, three-dimensional structures.
The folding process, while it looks random, is in fact very precise.
Each protein folds to its characteristic shape each time, and the folding process takes just a fraction of a second.
And it's the shapes of proteins which enable them to carry out their remarkable biological functions.
For example, hemoglobin has a shape in the lungs perfectly suited for binding a molecule of oxygen.
When hemoglobin moves to your muscle, the shape changes slightly and the oxygen comes out.
The shapes of proteins, and hence their remarkable functions, are completely specified by the sequence of amino acids in the protein chain.
In this picture, each letter on top is an amino acid.
Where do these sequences come from?
The genes in your genome specify the amino acid sequences of your proteins. Each gene encodes the amino acid sequence of a single protein.
The translation between these amino acid sequences and the structures and functions of proteins is known as the protein folding problem.
It's a very hard problem because there's so many different shapes a protein can adopt.
Because of this complexity, humans have only been able to harness the power of proteins by making very small changes to the amino acid sequences of the proteins we've found in nature.
This is similar to the process that our Stone Age ancestors used to make tools and other implements from the sticks and stones that we found in the world around us.
But humans did not learn to fly by modifying birds.
(Laughter) Instead, scientists, inspired by birds, uncovered the principles of aerodynamics.
Engineers then used those principles to design custom flying machines.
In a similar way, we've been working for a number of years to uncover the fundamental principles of protein folding and encoding those principles in the computer program called Rosetta.
We made a breakthrough in recent years.
We can now design completely new proteins from scratch on the computer.
Once we've designed the new protein, we encode its amino acid sequence in a synthetic gene.
We have to make a synthetic gene because since the protein is completely new, there's no gene in any organism on earth which currently exists that encodes it.
Once we have those synthetic genes, we put them into bacteria to program them to make these brand-new proteins.
We then extract the proteins and determine whether they function as we designed them to and whether they're safe.
It's exciting to be able to make new proteins, because despite the diversity in nature, evolution has only sampled a tiny fraction of the total number of proteins possible.
And it's this unimaginably large space we can now explore using computational protein design.
Now the proteins that exist on earth evolved to solve the problems faced by natural evolution.
For example, replicating the genome.
But we face new challenges today.
We live longer, so new diseases are important.
We're heating up and polluting the planet, so we face a whole host of ecological challenges.
If we had a million years to wait, new proteins might evolve to solve those challenges.
But we don't have millions of years to wait.
Instead, with computational protein design, we can design new proteins to address these challenges today.
Our audacious idea is to bring biology out of the Stone Age through technological revolution in protein design.
We've already shown that we can design new proteins with new shapes and functions.
For example, vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to make a strong response against a pathogen.
To make better vaccines, we've designed protein particles to which we can fuse proteins from pathogens, like this blue protein here, from the respiratory virus RSV.
To make vaccine candidates that are literally bristling with the viral protein, we find that such vaccine candidates produce a much stronger immune response to the virus than any previous vaccines that have been tested.
This is important because RSV is currently one of the leading causes of infant mortality worldwide.
We've also designed new proteins to break down gluten in your stomach for celiac disease and other proteins to stimulate your immune system to fight cancer.
These advances are the beginning of the protein design revolution.
We've been inspired by a previous technological revolution: the digital revolution, which took place in large part due to advances in one place, Bell Laboratories.
Bell Labs was a place with an open, collaborative environment, and was able to attract top talent from around the world.
And this led to a remarkable string of innovations -- the transistor, the laser, satellite communication and the foundations of the internet.
Our goal is to build the Bell Laboratories of protein design.
We are seeking to attract talented scientists from around the world to accelerate the protein design revolution, and we'll be focusing on five grand challenges.
First, by taking proteins from flu strains from around the world and putting them on top of the designed protein particles I showed you earlier, we aim to make a universal flu vaccine, one shot of which gives a lifetime of protection against the flu.
The ability to design -- (Applause) The ability to design new vaccines on the computer is important both to protect against natural flu epidemics and, in addition, intentional acts of bioterrorism.
Second, we're going far beyond nature's limited alphabet of just 20 amino acids to design new therapeutic candidates for conditions such as chronic pain, using an alphabet of thousands of amino acids.
Third, we're building advanced delivery vehicles to target existing medications exactly where they need to go in the body.
For example, chemotherapy to a tumor or gene therapies to the tissue where gene repair needs to take place.
Fourth, we're designing smart therapeutics that can do calculations within the body and go far beyond current medicines, which are really blunt instruments.
I hope you'll join us, and thank you.
And it's the shapes of proteins which enable them to carry out their remarkable biological functions.
For example, hemoglobin has a shape in the lungs perfectly suited for binding a molecule of oxygen.
Where do these sequences come from?
The genes in your genome specify the amino acid sequences of your proteins. Each gene encodes the amino acid sequence of a single protein.
The translation between these amino acid sequences and the structures and functions of proteins is known as the protein folding problem.
It's a very hard problem because there's so many different shapes a protein can adopt.
Because of this complexity, humans have only been able to harness the power of proteins by making very small changes to the amino acid sequences of the proteins we've found in nature.
But humans did not learn to fly by modifying birds.
(Laughter) Instead, scientists, inspired by birds, uncovered the principles of aerodynamics.
In a similar way, we've been working for a number of years to uncover the fundamental principles of protein folding and encoding those principles in the computer program called Rosetta.
We made a breakthrough in recent years.
We have to make a synthetic gene because since the protein is completely new, there's no gene in any organism on earth which currently exists that encodes it.
To make vaccine candidates that are literally bristling with the viral protein, we find that such vaccine candidates produce a much stronger immune response to the virus than any previous vaccines that have been tested.
Fourth, we're designing smart therapeutics that can do calculations within the body and go far beyond current medicines, which are really blunt instruments.
To do all this, we're growing our institute.
We seek to attract energetic, talented and diverse scientists from around the world, at all career stages, to join us.
You can also participate in the protein design revolution through our online folding and design game, "Foldit.
" And through our distributed computing project, Rosetta@home, which you can join from your laptop or your Android smartphone. Making the world a better place through protein design is my life's work.
I'm so excited about what we can do together.
I hope you'll join us, and thank you.
(Applause and cheers)
In 2019, humanity received a warning: 30 of the world's leading scientists released the results of a massive three-year study into global agriculture and declared that meat production is destroying our planet and jeopardizing global health.
One of the study's authors explained that "humanity now poses a threat to the stability of the planet . . . [This requires] nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution.
" As somebody who's spent the last two decades advocating a shift away from industrial meat production, I wanted to believe that this clarion call was going to make a difference.
The thing is, I've seen this sort of thing again and again and again for decades.
Here's 2018 from the journal "Nature," 2017 from "Bioscience Journal," 2016 from the National Academy of Sciences.
The main point of these studies tends to be climate change.
But antibiotic resistance represents just as big of a threat.
We are feeding massive doses of antibiotics to farm animals.
These antibiotics are then mutating into superbugs that threaten to render antibiotics obsolete within all of our lifetimes.
You want a scare?
Google: "the end of working antibiotics.
" I'm going to get one thing out of the way: I am not here to tell anybody what to eat.
Individual action is great, but antibiotic resistance and climate change -- they require more.
Besides, convincing the world to eat less meat hasn't worked.
For 50 years, environmentalists, global health experts and animal activists have been begging the public to eat less meat.
And yet, per capita meat consumption is as high as it's been in recorded history.
The average North American last year ate more than 200 pounds of meat.
And I didn't eat any.
(Laughter) Which means somebody out there ate 400 pounds of meat.
(Laughter) On our current trajectory, we're going to need to be producing 70 to 100 percent more meat by 2050. This requires a global solution.
What we need to do is we need to produce the meat that people love, but we need to produce it in a whole new way.
I've got a couple of ideas.
Idea number one: let's grow meat from plants.
Instead of growing plants, feeding them to animals, and all of that inefficiency, let's grow those plants, let's biomimic meat with them, let's make plant-based meat.
Idea number two: for actual animal meat, let's grow it directly from cells.
Instead of growing live animals, let's grow the cells directly.
It takes six weeks to grow a chicken to slaughter weight. Grow the cells directly, you can get that same growth in six days.
This is what that looks like at scale.
It's your friendly neighborhood meat brewery.
(Laughter) I want to make two points about this.
The first one is, we believe we can do it.
In recent years, some companies have been producing meat from plants that consumers cannot distinguish from actual animal meat, and there are now dozens of companies growing actual animal meat directly from cells.
This plant-based and cell-based meat gives consumers everything that they love about meat -- the taste, the texture and so on -- but with no need for antibiotics and with a fraction of the adverse impact on the climate.
And because these two technologies are so much more efficient, at production scale these products will be cheaper.
But one quick point about that -- it's not going to be easy.
These plant-based companies have spent small fortunes on their burgers, and cell-based meat has not yet been commercialized at all.
So we're going to need all hands on deck to make these the global meat industry.
For starters, we need the present meat industry.
We don't want to disrupt the meat industry, we want to transform it.
We need their economies of scale, their global supply chain, their marketing expertise and their massive consumer base.
We also need governments.
Governments spend tens of billions of dollars every single year on research and development focused on global health and the environment.
They should be putting some of that money into optimizing and perfecting the production of plant-based and cell-based meat.
Look, tens of thousands of people died from antibiotic-resistant superbugs in North America just last year.
By 2050, that number is going to be 10 million per year globally.
And climate change represents an existential threat to huge portions of our global family, including some of the poorest people on the face of the planet.
Climate change, antibiotic resistance -- these are global emergencies.
We have the solution.
Let's make meat from plants.
Let's grow it directly from cells.
It's past time that we mobilize the resources that are necessary to create the next global agricultural revolution.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving car winds down a narrow country road.
Suddenly, three hazards appear at the same time.
What happens next?
Before it can navigate this onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms can plot the safest course.
With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second.
That’s a tall order, but there’s a solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe called LIDAR, and a miniature version of the communications technology that keeps the internet humming, called integrated photonics.
To understand LIDAR, it helps to start with a related technology— radar.
In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing how long the beams take to bounce back.
That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size can’t visualize fine details.
In contrast, a self-driving car’s LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser.
It can image features as small as the button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street.
But how do we determine the shape, or depth, of these features?
LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser pulses to give depth resolution.
Take the moose on the country road.
As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip of one antler before bouncing back.
Measuring how much longer the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape.
With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system quickly renders a detailed profile.
The most obvious way to create a pulse of light is to switch a laser on and off.
But this makes a laser unstable and affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution.
Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically block the light reliably and rapidly. That’s where integrated photonics come in.
The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed pulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds.
One way to create these pulses is with a Mach-Zehnder modulator.
This device takes advantage of a particular wave property, called interference.
Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap, a pattern forms.
In some places, wave peaks add up to become very large; in other places, they completely cancel out.
The Mach-Zehnder modulator does something similar.
It splits waves of light along two parallel arms and eventually rejoins them.
If the light is slowed down and delayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and cancel, blocking the light.
By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, emitting pulses of light.
A light pulse lasting a hundred picoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a few centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need to see better than that.
By pairing the modulator with a super- sensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined to a millimeter.
That’s more than a hundred times better than what we can make out with 20/20 vision, from across a street.
These chips will also include a clever variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts and scan at rapid speeds.
By slowing the light in a modulator arm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more like a dimmer than an on/off switch.
If an array of many such arms, each with a tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel can be designed: a steerable laser beam.
From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number of obstacles.
All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose.
About two years ago, I got a phone call that changed my life.
"Hey, this is your cousin Hassen.
" I froze.
You see, I have well over 30 first cousins, but I didn't know anybody named Hassen.
It turned out that Hassen was actually my mom's cousin and had just arrived in Montreal as a refugee.
And over the next few months, I would have three more relatives coming to Canada to apply for asylum with little more than the clothes on their back.
And in the two years since that phone call, my life has completely changed.
I left academia and now lead a diverse team of technologists, researchers and refugees that is developing customized self-help resources for newcomers.
We want to help them overcome language, cultural and other barriers that make them feel like they've lost control over their own lives.
And we feel that AI can help restore the rights and the dignity that many people lose when seeking help.
My family's refugee experience is not unique.
According to the UNHCR, every minute, 20 people are newly displaced by climate change, economic crisis and social and political instability.
And it was while volunteering at a local YMCA shelter that my cousin Hassen and other relatives were sent to that we saw and learned to appreciate how much effort and coordination resettlement requires.
When you first arrive, you need to find a lawyer and fill out legal documents within two weeks.
You also need to schedule a medical exam with a pre-authorized physician, just so that you can apply for a work permit.
And you need to start looking for a place to live before you receive any sort of social assistance.
With thousands fleeing the United States to seek asylum in Canada over the past few years, we quickly saw what it looks like when there are more people who need help than there are resources to help them.
Social services doesn't scale quickly, and even if communities do their best to help more people with limited resources, newcomers end up spending more time waiting in limbo, not knowing where to turn.
In Montreal, for example, despite millions of dollars being spent to support resettlement efforts, nearly 50 percent of newcomers still don't know that there are free resources that exist to help them with everything from filling out paperwork to finding a job.
The challenge is not that this information doesn't exist.
On the contrary, those in need are often bombarded with so much information that it's difficult to make sense of it all.
"Don't give me more information, just tell me what to do," was a sentiment we heard over and over again.
And it reflects how insanely difficult it could be to get your bearings when you first arrive in a new country.
Hell, I struggled with the same issues when I got to Montreal, and I have a PhD.
(Laughter) As another member of our team, himself also a refugee, put it: "In Canada, a SIM card is more important than food, because we will not die from hunger.
" But getting access to the right resources and information can be the difference between life and death.
Let me say that again: getting access to the right resources and information can be the difference between life and death.
In order to address these issues, we built Atar, the first-ever AI-powered virtual advocate that guides you step-by-step through your first week of arriving in a new city.
Just tell Atar what you need help with.
Atar will then ask you some basic questions to understand your unique circumstances and determine your eligibility for resources.
For example: Do you have a place to stay tonight?
If not, would you prefer an all-women's shelter?
Do you have children?
Atar will then generate a custom, step-by-step to-do list that tells you everything that you need to know, from where to go, how to get there, what to bring with you and what to expect.
You can ask a question at any time, and if Atar doesn't have an answer, you'll be connected with a real person who does.
But what's most exciting is that we help humanitarian and service organizations collect the data and the analytics that's necessary to understand the changing needs of newcomers in real time.
That's a game changer.
We've already partnered with the UNHCR to provide this technology in Canada, and in our work have conducted campaigns in Arabic, English, French, Creole and Spanish.
When we talk about the issue of refugees, we often focus on the official statistic of 65.8 million forcibly displaced worldwide.
But the reality is much greater than that.
By 2050, there will be an additional 140 million people who are at risk of being displaced due to environmental degradation.
And today -- that is today -- there are nearly one billion people who already live in illegal settlements and slums.
and our hope is that Atar can provide every single newcomer an advocate.
Our hope is that Atar can amplify existing efforts and alleviate pressure on a social safety net that's already stretched beyond imagination.
But what's most important to us is that our work helps restore the rights and the dignity that refugees lose throughout resettlement and integration by giving them the resources that they need in order to help themselves.
Thank you.

Why are transgender people suddenly everywhere?
(Laughter) As a trans activist, I get this question a lot. Keep in mind, less than one percent of American adults openly identify as trans. According to a recent GLAAD survey, about 16 percent of non-trans Americans claim to know a trans person in real life.
So for the other 84 percent, this may seem like a new topic.
But trans people are not new.
Gender variance is older than you think, and trans people are part of that legacy.
From central Africa to South America to the Pacific Islands and beyond, there have been populations who recognize multiple genders, and they go way back.
The hijra of India and Pakistan, for example, have been cited as far back as 2,000 years ago in the Kama Sutra.
Indigenous American nations each have their own terms, but most share the umbrella term "two-spirit.
" They saw gender-variant people as shamans and healers in their communities, and it wasn't until the spread of colonialism that they were taught to think otherwise.
Now, in researching trans history, we look for both trans people and trans practices.
Take, for example, the women who presented as men so they could fight in the US Civil War.
After the war, most resumed their lives as women, but some, like Albert Cashier, continued to live as men.
Albert was eventually confined to an asylum and forced to wear a dress for the rest of his life.
(Sighs) Around 1895, a group of self-described androgynes formed the Cercle Hermaphroditos.
Their mission was to unite for defense against the world's bitter persecution.
And in doing that, they became one of the earliest trans support groups.
By the '40s and '50s, medical researchers were starting to study trans medicine, but they were aided by their trans patients, like Louise Lawrence, a trans woman who had corresponded extensively with people who had been arrested for public cross-dressing.
Some, like Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, walked in drag balls. Others were the so-called "street queens," who were often targeted by police for their gender expression and found themselves on the forefront of seminal events in the LGBT rights movement.
This brings us to the riots at Cooper Do-nuts in 1959, Compton's Cafeteria in 1966 and the famous Stonewall Inn in 1969. In 1970, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, two veterans of Stonewall, established STAR: Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries.
Trans people continued to fight for equal treatment under the law, even as they faced higher rates of discrimination, unemployment, arrests, and the looming AIDS epidemic.
For as long as we've been around, those in power have sought to disenfranchise trans people for daring to live lives that are ours.
This motion picture still, taken in Berlin in 1933, is sometimes used in history textbooks to illustrate how the Nazis burned works they considered un-German.
But what's rarely mentioned is that included in this massive pile are works from the Institute for Sexual Research.
See, I just recapped the trans movement in America, but Magnus Hirschfeld and his peers in Germany had us beat by a few decades.
Magnus Hirschfeld was an early advocate for LGBT people.
He wrote the first book-length account of trans individuals.
He helped them obtain medical services and IDs.
He worked with the Berlin Police Department to end discrimination of LGBT people, and he hired them at the Institute.
So when the Nazi Party burned his library, it had devastating implications for trans research around the world.
This was a deliberate attempt to erase trans people, and it was neither the first nor the last.
So whenever people ask me why trans people are suddenly everywhere, I just want to tell them that we've been here.
These stories have to be told, along with the countless others that have been buried by time.
Not only were our lives not celebrated, but our struggles have been forgotten and, yeah, to some people, that makes trans issues seem new.
Today, I meet a lot of people who think that our movement is just a phase that will pass, but I also hear well-intentioned allies telling us all to be patient, because our movement is "still new.
" Imagine how the conversation would shift if we acknowledge just how long trans people have been demanding equality.
Are we still overreacting?
Should we continue to wait?
Or should we, for example, do something about the trans women of color who are murdered and whose killers never see justice?
Do our circumstances seem dire to you yet?
(Sighs) Finally, I want other trans people to realize they're not alone.
I grew up thinking my identity was an anomaly that would die with me.
People drilled this idea of otherness into my mind, and I bought it because I didn't know anyone else like me.
(Applause)Why are transgender people suddenly everywhere?

(Sighs) Finally, I want other trans people to realize they're not alone.
People drilled this idea of otherness into my mind, and I bought it because I didn't know anyone else like me.
Maybe if I had known my ancestors sooner, it wouldn't have taken me so long to find a source of pride in my identity and in my community.
And we're not going anywhere.
" Thank you.
(Applause)
However, for over 200 years, this prevention was not believed to extend to psychiatric diseases.
Until 2014, when my colleague and I accidentally discovered the first drugs that might prevent depression and PTSD. We discovered the drugs in mice, and we're currently studying whether they work in humans. And these preventative psychopharmaceuticals are not antidepressants. They are a whole new class of drug.
And insufficient resilience in the face of a significant enough stressor, can result in a psychiatric disorder, such as depression.

I was eight years old.
I remember that day clearly like it happened just yesterday.
My mother is a bidi roller.
She hand-rolls country cigarettes to sustain our family.
She is a hard worker and spent 10 to 12 hours every day rolling bidis.
That particular day she came home and showed me her bidi-rolling wage book.
She asked me how much money she has earned that week.
I went through that book, and what caught my eyes were her thumbprints on each page.
My mother has never been to school.
She uses her thumbprints instead of a signature to keep a record of her earnings.
On that day, for some reason, I wanted to teach her how to hold a pen and write her name.
She was reluctant at first.
She smiled innocently and said no.
But deep down, I was sure she wanted to give it a try.
With a little bit of perseverance and a lot of effort, we managed to write her name.
Her hands were trembling, and her face was beaming with pride.
As I watched her do this, for the first time in my life, I had a priceless feeling: that I could be of some use to this world.
That feeling was very special, because I am not meant to be useful.
In rural India, girls are generally considered worthless.
They're a liability or a burden.
If they are considered useful, it is only to cook dishes, keep the house clean or raise children.
As a second daughter of my conservative Indian family, I was fairly clear from a very early age that no one expected anything from me.
I was conditioned to believe that the three identities that defined me -- poor village girl -- meant that I was to live a life of no voice and no choice.
These three identities forced me to think that I should never have been born.
Yet, I was.
All throughout my childhood, as I rolled bidis alongside my mother, I would wonder: What did my future hold?
I often asked my mother, with a lot of anxiety, "Amma, will my life be different from yours?
Will I have a chance to choose my life?
Will I go to college?
" And she would reply back, "Try to finish high school first.
" I am sure my mother did not mean to discourage me.
She only wanted me to understand that my dreams might be too big for a girl in my village.
When I was 13, I found the autobiography of Helen Keller.
Helen became my inspiration.
I admired her indomitable spirit.
I wanted to have a college degree like her, so I fought with my father and my relatives to be sent to college, and it worked.
During my final year of my undergraduate degree, I desperately wanted to escape from being forced into marriage, so I applied to a fellowship program in Delhi, which is about 1,600 miles away from my village.
(Laughter) In fact, I recall that the only way I could fill out the application was during my commute to college.
I did not have access to computers, so I had to borrow a college junior's cell phone.
As a woman, I could not be seen with a cell phone, so I used to huddle his phone under my shawl and type as slowly as possible to ensure that I would not be heard.
After many rounds of interviews, I got into the fellowship program with a full scholarship.
My father was confused, my mother was worried -- (Applause) My father was confused, my mother was worried, but I felt butterflies in my stomach because I was going to step out of my village for the first time to study in the national capital.
Of the 97 fellows selected that year, I was the only rural college graduate.
There was no one there who looked like me or spoke like me.
I felt alienated, intimidated and judged by many.
One fellow called me "Coconut Girl.
" Can you guess why?
Anyone?
That's because I applied a lot of coconut oil to my hair.
(Laughter) Another asked me where I had learned to speak English, and some of my peers did not prefer to have me on their assignment teams because they thought I would not be able to contribute to their discussion.
I felt that many of my peers believed that a person from rural India could not supply anything of value, yet the majority of Indian population today is rural.
I realized that stories like mine were considered to be an exception and never the expectation.
I believe that all of us are born into a reality that we blindly accept until something awakens us and a new world opens up.
By the time my fellowship ended, my life had changed.
Not only had I traced my lost voice, but also had a choice to make myself useful.
I was 22. I came back to my village to set up the Bodhi Tree Foundation, an institution that supports rural youth by providing them with education, life skills and opportunities.
We work closely with our rural youth to change their life and to benefit our communities.
How do I know my institution is working?
Well, six months ago, we had a new joinee.
Her name is Kaviarasi.
I first spotted her in a local college in Tirunelveli during one of my training sessions.
As you can see, she has a smile which you can never forget.
We guided her to get an opportunity to study at Ashoka University, Delhi.
The best part of her story is that she is now back at Bodhi Tree as a trainer working with dedication to make a change in the lives of others like her.
Kaviarasi doesn't want to feel like an exception.
She wants to be of use to others in this world.
Recently, Kaviarasi mentored Anitha, who also comes from a remote, rural village, lives in a 10-foot-by-10-foot home, her parents are also farm laborers.
Kaviarasi helped Anitha secure admission in a prestigious undergraduate program in a top university in India with a full scholarship.
When Anitha's parents were reluctant to send her that far, we asked the district administration officials to speak to Anitha's parents, and it worked.
And then there is Padma.
Padma and I went to college together.
She's the first in her entire village to attend graduation.
She had been working with me at Bodhi Tree until one day she decides to go to graduate school.
I asked her why.
She told me that she wanted to make sure that she would never be a liability or a burden to anyone at any point in her life.
Padma, Anitha and Kaviarasi grew up in the most tough families and communities one could only imagine.
Yet the journey of finding my usefulness in this world served them in finding their usefulness to this world.
Of course there are challenges.
I'm aware change does not happen overnight.
A lot of my work involves working with families and communities to help them understand why getting an education is useful for everyone.
The quickest way to convince them is by doing.
When they see their kids getting a real education, getting a real job, they begin to change.
The best example is what happened at my home. I was recently given an award in recognition of my social work by the chief minister of my state.
That meant I was going to be on television.
(Laughter) Everyone was hooked on to the television that morning, including my parents.
I would like to believe that seeing her daughter on television made my mother feel useful too.
Hopefully, she will stop pressuring me to get married now.
(Laughter) Finding my use has helped me to break free from the identities society thrusts on me -- poor village girl.
Finding my use has helped me to break free from being boxed, caged and bottled.
Finding my use has helped me to find my voice, my self-worth and my freedom.
Thank you.
(Applause)I was eight years old.
I remember that day clearly like it happened just yesterday.
My mother is a bidi roller.
I often asked my mother, with a lot of anxiety, "Amma, will my life be different from yours?
Will I have a chance to choose my life?
I did not have access to computers, so I had to borrow a college junior's cell phone.
My father was confused, my mother was worried -- (Applause) My father was confused, my mother was worried, but I felt butterflies in my stomach because I was going to step out of my village for the first time to study in the national capital.
The best part of her story is that she is now back at Bodhi Tree as a trainer working with dedication to make a change in the lives of others like her.
(Applause)
So, a little while ago, members of my family had three bits of minor surgery, about a half hour each, and we got three sets of bills.
For the first one, the anesthesia bill alone was 2,000 dollars; the second one, 2,000 dollars; the third one, 6,000 dollars.
So I'm a journalist.
I'm like, what's up with that?
I found out that I was actually, for the expensive one, being charged 1,419 dollars for a generic anti-nausea drug that I could buy online for two dollars and forty-nine cents.
I had a long and unsatisfactory argument with the hospital, the insurer and my employer.
Everybody agreed that this was totally fine.
But it got me thinking, and the more I talked to people, the more I realized: nobody has any idea what stuff costs in health care.
Not before, during or after that procedure or test do you have any idea what it's going to cost.
It's only months later that you get an "explanation of benefits" that explains exactly nothing.
So this came back to me a little while later.
I had volunteered for a buyout from the New York Times, where I had worked for more than 20 years as a journalist.
I was looking for my next act.
It turned out that next act was to build a company telling people what stuff costs in health care.
I won a "Shark Tank"-type pitch contest to do just that.
Health costs ate up almost 18 percent of our gross domestic product last year, but nobody has any idea what stuff costs.
But what if we did know?
So we started out small.
We called doctors and hospitals and asked them what they would accept as a cash payment for simple procedures.
Some people were helpful.
A lot of people hung up on us.
Some people were just plain rude.
They said, "We don't know," or, "Our lawyers won't let us tell you that," though we did get a lot of information.
We found, for example, that here in the New York area, you could get an echocardiogram for 200 dollars in Brooklyn or for 2,150 dollars in Manhattan, just a few miles away.
New Orleans, the same simple blood test, 19 dollars over here, 522 dollars just a few blocks away.
San Francisco, the same MRI, 475 dollars or 6,221 dollars just 25 miles away.
These pricing variations existed for all the procedures and all the cities that we surveyed.
Then we started to ask people to tell us their health bills.
In partnership with public radio station WNYC here in New York, we asked women to tell us the prices of their mammograms.
People told us nobody would do that, that it was too personal.
But in the space of three weeks, 400 women told us about their prices.
Then we started to make it easier for people to share their data into our online searchable database.
It's sort of like a mash-up of Kayak. com and the Waze traffic app for health care.
(Laughter) We call it a community-created guide to health costs.
Our survey and crowdsourcing work grew into partnerships with top newsrooms nationwide -- in New Orleans, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami and other places.
We used the data to tell stories about people who were suffering and how to avoid that suffering, to avoid that "gotcha" bill.
A woman in New Orleans saved nearly 4,000 dollars using our data.
A San Francisco contributor saved nearly 1,300 dollars by putting away his insurance card and paying cash.
There are a lot of people who are going to in-network hospitals and getting out-of-network bills.
And then there was the hospital that continued to bill a dead man.
We learned that thousands of people wanted to tell us their prices.
They want to learn what stuff costs, find out how to argue a bill, help us solve this problem that's hurting them and their friends and families.
We talked to people who had to sell a car to pay a health bill, go into bankruptcy, skip a treatment because of the cost.
Imagine if you could afford the diagnosis but not the cure.
We set off a huge conversation about costs involving doctors and hospitals, yes, but also their patients, or as we like to call them, people.
(Laughter) We changed policy.
A consumer protection bill that had been stalled in the Louisiana legislature for 10 years passed after we launched.
Let's face it: this huge, slow-rolling public health crisis is a national emergency.
And I don't think government's going to help us out anytime soon.
But what if the answer was really simple: make all the prices public all the time.
Would our individual bills go down?
Our health premiums?
Be really clear about this: this is a United States problem.
In most of the rest of the developed world, sick people don't have to worry about money.
It's also true that price transparency will not solve every problem.
There will still be expensive treatments, huge friction from our insurance system.
There will still be fraud and a massive problem with overtreatment and overdiagnosis.
And not everything is shoppable.
Not everybody wants the cheapest appendectomy or the cheapest cancer care.
But when we talk about these clear effects, we're looking at a real issue that's actually very simple.
When we first started calling for prices, we actually felt like we were going to be arrested.
And it got easier to ask.
So I'll leave you with some questions.
What if we all knew what stuff cost in health care in advance?
What if, every time you Googled for an MRI, you got drop-downs telling you where to buy and for how much, the way you do when you Google for a laser printer?
What if all of the time and energy and money that's spent hiding prices was squeezed out of the system?
What if each one of us could pick the $19 test every time instead of the $522 one?
Would our individual bills go down?
Our premiums?
I don't know, but if you don't ask, you'll never know.
And you might save a ton of money.
And I've got to think that a lot of us and the system itself would be a lot healthier.
For the first one, the anesthesia bill alone was 2,000 dollars; the second one, 2,000 dollars; the third one, 6,000 dollars.
So I'm a journalist.
I found out that I was actually, for the expensive one, being charged 1,419 dollars for a generic anti-nausea drug that I could buy online for two dollars and forty-nine cents.

And I've got to think that a lot of us and the system itself would be a lot healthier.
Here are two images of a house.
There’s one obvious difference, but to this patient, P. S. , they looked completely identical.
P. S. had suffered a stroke that damaged the right side of her brain, leaving her unaware of everything on her left side.
But though she could discern no difference between the houses, when researchers asked her which she would prefer to live in, she chose the house that wasn’t burning— not once, but again and again. P. S. ’s brain was still processing information from her whole field of vision.
She could see both images and tell the difference between them, she just didn’t know it.
That experience is what we call consciousness. We are conscious of both the external world and our internal selves— we are aware of an image in much the same way we are aware of ourselves looking at an image, or our inner thoughts and emotions.
But where does consciousness come from?
Scientists, theologians, and philosophers have been trying to get to the bottom of this question for centuries— without reaching any consensus. One recent theory is that consciousness is the brain’s imperfect picture of its own activity.
To understand this theory, it helps to have a clear idea of one important way the brain processes information from our senses. Based on sensory input, it builds models, which are continuously updating, simplified descriptions of objects and events in the world.
Everything we know is based on these models.
They never capture every detail of the things they describe, just enough for the brain to determine appropriate responses.
For instance, one model built deep into the visual system codes white light as brightness without color.
In reality, white light includes wavelengths that correspond to all the different colors we can see.
Our perception of white light is wrong and oversimplified, but good enough for us to function.
For example, the brain has the ability to pay attention to specific objects and events.
It also controls that focus, shifting it from one thing to another, internal and external, according to our needs.
Without the ability to direct our focus, we wouldn’t be able to assess threats, finish a meal, or function at all.
To control focus effectively, the brain has to construct a model of its own attention.
With 86 billion neurons constantly interacting with each other, there’s no way the brain’s model of its own information processing can be perfectly self-descriptive.
Scientists have already begun trying to figure out how the brain creates that self model.
MRI studies are a promising avenue for pinpointing the networks involved. These studies compare patterns of neural activation when someone is and isn’t conscious of a sensory stimulus, like an image.
The results show that the areas needed for visual processing are activated whether or not the participant is aware of the image, but a whole additional network lights up only when they are conscious of seeing the image.
Patients with hemispatial neglect, like P. S. , typically have damage to one particular part of this network.
More extensive damage to the network can sometimes lead to a vegetative state, with no sign of consciousness. Evidence like this brings us closer to understanding how consciousness is built into the brain, but there’s still much more to learn.
More extensive damage to the network can sometimes lead to a vegetative state, with no sign of consciousness. Evidence like this brings us closer to understanding how consciousness is built into the brain, but there’s still much more to learn.
Every year, more than four to five million people die due to exposure to outdoor air pollution around the world.
This petri dish that you are looking at contains approximately 20 minutes' worth of pollution captured off a pyrolysis plant.
This is PM 2.5. These particles -- you can see it right now, but when they're out there in the air, you won't see them.
These are so tiny that our lungs -- our bodies cannot filter them, and they end up in our bodies -- give us asthma and lung cancer if not treated in the right time.
On a trip back to India, when I was a student in 2012, I took this picture.
This picture stuck in my head.
On one side, you see this exhaust of a diesel generator, the same generator which is a sign of human progress, which is a sign of rapid industrialization and what we have become as a society in the last 100 years, generating energy.
But on the other side, you see this very interesting triangular, black-colored swatch, that is produced by the same residual particulate waste created by the emissions of the generator.
Now, this picture gave me an idea and got me thinking about rethinking both pollution and inks, because it was making that black-colored mark.
Now, the reality is that most of the black ink that we use conventionally is traditionally produced by conventionally burning fossil fuels in factories.
There are factories around the world that are burning fossil fuels to produce carbon black, to make black inks that we use on an everyday basis.
But given that millions of liters of fossil fuels are already being burned out there by our cars, our engines and our exhaust out there, what if you could capture that pollution and use it to recycle and make those inks?
I decided to give this experiment a shot.
I went back to my lab back in Boston and conducted a small experiment.
In Boston, I couldn't find much pollution to play with, so I resorted to using a candle.
This was an experiment.
I burnt a candle, built this contraption that would suck in that candle soot, mixed it with some vegetable oil and vodka, because to a DIY hacker, these were really easily available.
(Laughter) And after mixing them, you could churn out a very rudimentary form of ink that would go into a cartridge, and now you could print with it.
This was my "Hello, World!
" of experimenting with printing with pollution.
This is the same pollution that I showed you in the petri dish, which is the result of any fossil fuel that is being burned out there.
In 2015, I decided to take this experimentation forward and set up a lab in India to work on the capture and recycling of air pollution.
In the good times, the lab used to look something like this.
But experimentations were not always controlled, and disasters happened.
And while experimentation would happen, the lab would end up looking something like this.
Well, we knew where we wanted to go, but we were not sure how exactly to reach there.
The passersby who used to go by that lab through that building used to, at times, think, "These guys are making bombs in there," because there was too much fire, wires and smoke in the same vicinity.
(Laughter) We decided, let's move to a garage and take experiments forward.
We took a garage, and during the early stages, we were driving around Bangalore with contraptions like these.
This is an early-stage prototype.
Imagine the looks people gave us, "What are these cars driving around doing?
" This is an early-stage prototype of our system that would capture pollution that is being released from a conventional diesel-based car.
This is an early stage of the technology.
We advanced the technology and created this into this version that would capture pollution from static sources of pollution, like a diesel generator.
If you see, all the fumes disappear as soon as you turn this machine on.
Without affecting the performance of the engine, we are able to capture 95 percent worth of pollution released from the diesel generator.
This is the particulate matter that we are talking about that we capture, in this case, within three to four hours of operation of a generator.
And while our experiments and our research was advancing, a very big company, a very big brand, approached us and said, "We want to take this idea further with you guys, and take this further in a very big celebrated form.
" They said, "Let's do a global art campaign with the inks that you are making off this pollution.
" I'll show you what the ink looks like.
So, this pen is made by recycling 40 to 50 minutes of that car pollution that we are talking about, the same pollution that is in the petri dish.
And it's a very sharp black that you can write with. So I'm going to write . . . PM 2.5, that's incorrect.
So this is a very sharp black that is generated by the same pollution.
After much work on the lab-level research, we got an offer from a big corporation to do a very big trial of this idea.
And it happened to be a brand, and we didn't think twice.
We said, "Let's go ahead.
" Inventing in the lab is one thing and taking ideas and deploying them in the real world is completely another.
During early stages, we had to resort to using our own houses and own kitchens as our ink-making factories, and our own bedrooms and living rooms as the first assembly line for making these inks.
This is my cofounder Nikhil's own bedroom, that is being used to supply inks to artists all around the world, who would paint with AIR-INK.
And that's him, delivering AIR-INKs to the ports so that the artists around the world can use it.
Soon, we started seeing that thousands of artists around the world started using AIR-INK, and artworks started emerging like this.
Soon, thousands of black-and-white, pollution-made artworks started emerging on a global scale.
And believe me, for a group of scientists and engineers and inventors, there was nothing more satisfying than that the product of their work is now being used by some of the finest artists around the world.
This is the cover of "Contagious" magazine last year, that was done by using the same ink that we made back in our labs.
This is a famous painting by the British artist, Christian Furr, who painted it for the song "Paint It Black" by The Rolling Stones.
Now, there's more to this pen and this ink than just the popular and pop-culture artworks.
And now our goal is to create a company that can actually make some black money -- I mean, just money -- (Laughter) and high-quality printing processes and inks that can replace the conventional black inks that have been produced for the last thousands of years around the world.
Soon after our growing popularity and artworks around the world, we started facing a very different kind of a problem.
We started getting spammed by polluters, who would send us bags full of pollution to our office address, asking us, "What can we do with this pollution?
" Our lab back in Bombay right now has pollution samples that have come from London, from India, from China, you name it.
And this is just the beginning.
This polluter sent us this specific image, asking us that these are all bags filled with PM 2.5, and can we recycle it for him if we paid him some money.
Well, what would he have done if we did not take that pollution?
He would probably find a nearby river or a landfill and dump it over there.
But now, because we had the economics of AIR-INK figured out on the other side, we could incentivize him to give us this pollution and make inks from it, and turn it into even more valuable products.
Now, pollution, as we all know, is a global killer.
We can't claim that our ink will solve the world's pollution problem.
But it does show what can be done if you look at this problem slightly differently.
Look at this T-shirt I'm holding right now.
This is made from the same AIR-INK I'm talking about.
It's made from the same pollution that is inside this petri dish.
And the same pollution we are all breathing in when we are walking outdoors.
And we are on our way to do better than this.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)Every year, more than four to five million people die due to exposure to outdoor air pollution around the world.
This is PM 2.5. These particles -- you can see it right now, but when they're out there in the air, you won't see them.

It was made by President Reagan, and it wasn't about climate change and the Paris Climate Accord.
It was actually about the Montreal Protocol and stratospheric ozone depletion.
Now, I'm sure that many of you aren't familiar with this environmental problem, but you should be, because it's a rare environmental success story.
And it's worth revisiting, because sometimes, we need to examine the world we've avoided in order to find guidance for the choices we make today. So let's go back to the 1970s, when some questionable choices were made: first of all -- hoo -- hairstyles.
(Laughs) Second of all, objectively terrible quantities of hairspray, and third, CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons, man-made chemicals that were used as propellant in aerosol spray cans.
And see, it turns out these CFCs were a problem because they were destroying the ozone layer.
Now I'm sure most of you have heard of the ozone layer, but why does it matter?
Well, quite simply, the ozone layer is earth's sunscreen, and it's really fragile.
If you could take all of the ozone, which is mostly about 10 to 20 miles up above our heads, and compress it down to the surface of the earth, it would form a thin shell only about two pennies thick, about an eighth of an inch.
And that thin shell does an amazing amount of work, though.
It filters out more than 90 percent of the harmful UV radiation coming from the sun.
And while I'm sure many of you enjoy that suntan that you get from the remaining 10 percent, it causes a lot of problems: cataracts, damage to crops, damage to immune systems and also skin cancer.
It's not an exaggeration to say that a threat to the ozone layer is a threat to human safety.
And actually, ironically, it was human safety that motivated the invention of CFCs in the first place.
You see, in the early days of refrigeration, refrigerators used toxic and flammable chemicals like propane and ammonia.
For good reason, the refrigeration industry wanted a safe alternative, and they found that in 1928, when a scientist named Thomas Midgley synthesized the first commercially viable CFCs.
And in fact, Midgley famously inhaled CFCs and blew out a candle to demonstrate, at a scientific conference, that they were safe and nonflammable.
And in fact, as a scientist, I can tell you there is no way you could get away with that kind of antic today.
I mean, wow.
But really, at the time, CFCs were a really remarkable invention.
They allowed what we now know as modern-day refrigeration and air-conditioning and other things.
So it wasn't actually until over 40 years later, in the 1970s, when scientists realized that CFCs would break down high in the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer.
And this finding really set off a lot of public concern.
It led, ultimately, to the banning of CFC usage in aerosol spray cans in the US and a few other countries in 1978. Now, the story doesn't end there, because CFCs were used in much more than just spray cans.
In 1985, scientists discovered the Antarctic ozone hole, and this was a truly alarming discovery.
Scientists did not expect this at all.
Before the Antarctic ozone hole, scientists expected maybe a five or 10 percent reduction in ozone over a century.
But what they found over the course of less than a decade was that more than a third of the ozone had simply vanished, over an area larger than the size of the US.
And although we now know that CFCs are the root cause of this ozone hole, at the time, the science was far from settled.
Yet despite this uncertainty, the crisis helped spur nations to act.
So that quote that I started this talk with, about the Montreal Protocol, from President Reagan -- that was his signing statement when he signed the Montreal Protocol after its unanimous ratification by the US Senate.
And this is something that's truly worth celebrating.
In fact, yesterday was the 30th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol.
(Applause) Because of the protocol, ozone-depleting substances are now declining in our atmosphere, and we're starting to see the first signs of healing in the ozone layer.
And furthermore, because many of those ozone-depleting substances are also very potent greenhouse gases, the Montreal Protocol has actually delayed global warming by more than a decade.
That's just wonderful.
But I think it's worth asking the question, as we face our current environmental crisis, global warming, what lessons can we learn from Montreal?
Are there any?
I think there are.
First, we don't need absolute certainty to act.
When Montreal was signed, we were less certain then of the risks from CFCs than we are now of the risks from greenhouse gas emissions.
A common tactic that people who oppose climate action use is to completely ignore risk and focus only on uncertainty.
But so what about uncertainty?
We make decisions in the face of uncertainty all the time, literally all the time.
You know, I'll bet those of you who drove here tonight, you probably wore your seat belt.
And so ask yourself, did you wear your seat belt because someone told you with a hundred percent [certainty] that you would get in a car crash on the way here?
Probably not.
So that's the first lesson.
Risk management and decision making always have uncertainty.
Ignoring risk and focusing only on uncertainty is a distraction.
In other words, inaction is an action.
Second, it takes a village to raise a healthy environment.
The Montreal Protocol wasn't just put together by industry and governments or environmental advocacy groups and scientists. It was put together by all of them.
They all had a seat at the table, and they all played an important role in the solution.
And I think in this regard, we're actually seeing some encouraging signs today.
We see not just environmental groups concerned about climate change but also civic and religious groups, the military and businesses.
So wherever you find yourself on that spectrum, we need you at the table, because if we're going to solve global warming, it's going to take actions at all levels, from the individual to the international and everything in between.
Third lesson: don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
While Montreal has become the brake pedal for stopping ozone depletion, at its beginning, it was more just like a tap on the brakes.
It was actually the later amendments to the protocol that really marked the decision to hit the brakes on ozone depletion.
So to those who despair that the Paris Climate Accord didn't go far enough or that your limited actions on their own won't solve global warming, I say don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
And finally, I think it helps us to contemplate the world we've avoided. Indeed, the world we have avoided by enacting the Montreal Protocol is one of catastrophic changes to our environment and to human well-being.
By the 2030s, we'll be avoiding millions of new skin cancer cases per year with a number that would only grow.
If I'm lucky, I'll live long enough to see the end of this animation and to see the ozone hole restored to its natural state.
So as we write the story for earth's climate future for this century and beyond, we need to ask ourselves, what will our actions be so that someone can stand on this stage in 30 or 50 or a hundred years to celebrate the world that they've avoided.
Thank you.
It was made by President Reagan, and it wasn't about climate change and the Paris Climate Accord.

I was told to turn off the lights to save energy and to recycle paper to save resources.
I remember thinking that it was very strange that humans, who are an animal species among others, could be capable of changing the Earth's climate.
Because if we were, and if it was really happening, we wouldn't be talking about anything else.
As soon as you'd turn on the TV, everything would be about that.
Headlines, radio, newspapers, you would never read or hear about anything else, as if there was a world war going on.
But no one ever talked about it.
If burning fossil fuels was so bad that it threatened our very existence, how could we just continue like before?
Why were there no restrictions?
Why wasn't it made illegal?
To me, that did not add up.
It was too unreal.
So when I was 11, I became ill.
I fell into depression, I stopped talking, and I stopped eating.
In two months, I lost about 10 kilos of weight.
Later on, I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, OCD and selective mutism.
That basically means I only speak when I think it's necessary - now is one of those moments.
(Applause) For those of us who are on the spectrum, almost everything is black or white.
We aren't very good at lying, and we usually don't enjoy participating in this social game that the rest of you seem so fond of.
I don't understand that, because if the emissions have to stop, then we must stop the emissions.
To me that is black or white.
There are no gray areas when it comes to survival.
Either we go on as a civilization or we don't.
We have to change.
Rich countries like Sweden need to start reducing emissions by at least 15 percent every year. And that is so that we can stay below a two-degree warming target.
Yet, as the IPCC have recently demonstrated, aiming instead for 1.5 degrees Celsius would significantly reduce the climate impacts.
But we can only imagine what that means for reducing emissions.
You would think the media and every one of our leaders would be talking about nothing else, but they never even mention it.
Nor does anyone ever mention the greenhouse gases already locked in the system. Nor that air pollution is hiding a warming so that when we stop burning fossil fuels, we already have an extra level of warming perhaps as high as 0.5 to 1.1 degrees Celsius.
Furthermore does hardly anyone speak about the fact that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, with up to 200 species going extinct every single day, that the extinction rate today is between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than what is seen as normal.
Nor does hardly anyone ever speak about the aspect of equity or climate justice, clearly stated everywhere in the Paris Agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale.
Because how can we expect countries like India or Nigeria to care about the climate crisis if we who already have everything don't care even a second about it or our actual commitments to the Paris Agreement? So, why are we not reducing our emissions?
Why are they in fact still increasing?
Are we knowingly causing a mass extinction?
Are we evil?
No, of course not.
People keep doing what they do because the vast majority doesn't have a clue about the actual consequences of our everyday life, and they don't know that rapid change is required. We all think we know, and we all think everybody knows, but we don't.
Because how could we?
If there really was a crisis, and if this crisis was caused by our emissions, you would at least see some signs.
Not just flooded cities, tens of thousands of dead people, and whole nations leveled to piles of torn down buildings.
You would see some restrictions.
But no. And no one talks about it.
There are no emergency meetings, no headlines, no breaking news.
No one is acting as if we were in a crisis.
Even most climate scientists or green politicians keep on flying around the world, eating meat and dairy.
If I live to be 100, I will be alive in the year 2103. When you think about the future today, you don't think beyond the year 2050. By then, I will, in the best case, not even have lived half of my life.
What happens next?
The year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday.
If I have children or grandchildren, maybe they will spend that day with me.
Maybe they will ask me about you, the people who were around, back in 2018. Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything while there still was time to act.
What we do or don't do right now will affect my entire life and the lives of my children and grandchildren.
What we do or don't do right now, me and my generation can't undo in the future.
So when school started in August of this year, I decided that this was enough.
I set myself down on the ground outside the Swedish parliament.
I school striked for the climate.
Some people say that I should be in school instead.
Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can "solve the climate crisis.
" But the climate crisis has already been solved.
We already have all the facts and solutions.
All we have to do is to wake up and change.
And why should I be studying for a future that soon will be no more when no one is doing anything whatsoever to save that future?
And what is the point of learning facts in the school system when the most important facts given by the finest science of that same school system clearly means nothing to our politicians and our society.
(Applause) Now we're almost at the end of my talk, and this is where people usually start talking about hope, solar panels, wind power, circular economy, and so on, but I'm not going to do that.
We've had 30 years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas. And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work.
Because if it would have, the emissions would have gone down by now.
They haven't.
And yes, we do need hope, of course we do.
But the one thing we need more than hope is action.
Once we start to act, hope is everywhere. So instead of looking for hope, look for action.
Then, and only then, hope will come.
Today, we use 100 million barrels of oil every single day.
There are no politics to change that.
There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground.
So we can't save the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed.
Everything needs to change -- and it has to start today.
Thank you.
(Applause)When I was about eight years old, I first heard about something called climate change or global warming.
Apparently, that was something humans had created by our way of living.
I was told to turn off the lights to save energy and to recycle paper to save resources.
Headlines, radio, newspapers, you would never read or hear about anything else, as if there was a world war going on.
That basically means I only speak when I think it's necessary - now is one of those moments.
I don't understand that, because if the emissions have to stop, then we must stop the emissions.
But we can only imagine what that means for reducing emissions.
All we have to do is to wake up and change.
A side hustle is a little different than a second job.
A second job is about necessity.
While a side hustle can certainly bring in extra income, it's a little more aspirational. Side hustle captures a certain kind of scrappy, entrepreneurial spirit.
I've interviewed more than 100 women of color on Side Hustle Pro who started successful side hustles.
Nailah Ellis-Brown started Ellis Island Tea out of her trunk. Arsha Jones started her famous Capital City Co Mambo Sauce with one product and a PayPal link.
All these women are running side hustles.
What exactly does this tell us?
First, that people are seeing opportunity within their communities.
The goal here isn't necessarily to be the next Coca-Cola or Google.
Scale is great, but there's also beauty in a successful business that's built for a specific audience.
Second, people are increasingly interested in being their own boss.
Being your own boss takes discipline.
Self-made millionaires tend to have one big trait in common: they make decisions, hold themselves accountable and push through in the face of challenges.
A side hustle is a great way to try out being your own boss and see if you have those skills before fully stepping out on your own.
Third, people are multipassionate.
I want to stress that not every side hustle is started because someone hates their job.
Many are started simply because people are interested in lots of different things.
Lisa Price, who started a hair and beauty company, Carol's Daughter, was working in television production when she started side-hustling.
She says she actually loved her job.
It was the fact that she came home every day feeling good that led her to start experimenting with making fragrances and hair oils in her kitchen.
We're always being taught that we're supposed to know what we want to do when we grow up.
But when you're multipassionate, you want to dip and dabble in those different things.
It doesn't mean that you're not committed to your job, it just means that you have other outlets that bring you joy.
And that brings me to the final thing the side hustle revolution shows us: people want to make a bet on themselves.
Side hustles are appealing because it's easier to take that chance when you have some kind of income coming in. Even if a side hustle doesn't take off, it's still an investment in yourself.
Forty-one percent of millennials who have a side hustle say they've shared this information with their employers.
They're not worried about their managers reacting negatively.
They recognize all the learning and growth that comes with running a side hustle.
Everyone is looking to feel fulfilled.
Thirty-eight percent of baby boomers feel some kind of regret about their career.
No one wants that.
The truth is that there are many different ways to find happiness through what we do.
The term "side hustle" just seems to fit with this ethos where people are putting together a few different things to make a living.
The word "side hustle" has its roots in popular African American newspapers. In the 1920s, these papers used the word "hustle" to refer to some kind of scam. By the 1950s, they were using "side hustle" to refer to legitimate work, too.
A side hustle is a little different than a second job.
I've interviewed more than 100 women of color on Side Hustle Pro who started successful side hustles.
All these women are running side hustles.
What exactly does this tell us?
First, that people are seeing opportunity within their communities.
Second, people are increasingly interested in being their own boss.
Many are started simply because people are interested in lots of different things.
She says she actually loved her job.
Side hustles are appealing because it's easier to take that chance when you have some kind of income coming in. Even if a side hustle doesn't take off, it's still an investment in yourself.
Forty-one percent of millennials who have a side hustle say they've shared this information with their employers.
No one wants that.
There are two powerful phenomena unfolding on earth: the rise of global warming and the rise of women and girls.
The link between them is often overlooked, but gender equity is a key answer to our planetary challenge.
Gender and climate are inextricably linked.
Drawing down emissions depends on rising up.
First, a bit of context.
We are in a situation of urgency, severity and scope never before faced by humankind.
So far, our response isn't anywhere close to adequate.
But you already know that.
You know it in your gut, in your bones.
We are each part of the planet's living systems, knitted together with almost 7.7 billion human beings and 1.8 million known species.
We can feel the connections between us.
We can feel the brokenness and the closing window to heal it.
This earth, our home, is telling us that a better way of being must emerge, and fast.
In my experience, to have eyes wide open is to hold a broken heart every day.
It's a grief that I rarely speak, though my work calls on the power of voice.
I remind myself that the heart can simply break, or it can break open.
A broken-open heart is awake and alive and calls for action.
It is regenerative, like nature, reclaiming ruined ground, growing anew.
Life moves inexorably toward more life, toward healing, toward wholeness.
That's a fundamental ecological truth.
And we, all of us, we are life force.
On the face of it, the primary link between women, girls and a warming world is not life but death.
Awareness is growing that climate impacts hit women and girls hardest, given existing vulnerabilities.
There is greater risk of displacement, higher odds of being injured or killed during a natural disaster.
Prolonged drought can precipitate early marriage as families contend with scarcity.
Floods can force last-resort prostitution as women struggle to make ends meet.
The list goes on and goes wide.
These dynamics are most acute under conditions of poverty, from New Orleans to Nairobi.
Too often, the story ends here.
But not today.
Another empowering truth begs to be seen.
If we gain ground on gender equity, we also gain ground on addressing global warming.
This connection comes to light in three key areas, three areas where we can secure the rights of women and girls, shore up resilience and avert emissions at the same time.
Women are the primary farmers of the world.
They produce 60 to 80 percent of food in lower-income countries, often operating on fewer than five acres.
That's what the term "smallholder" means.
Compared with men, women smallholders have less access to resources, including land rights, credit and capital, training, tools and technology.
They farm as capably and efficiently as men, but this well-documented disparity in resources and rights means women produce less food on the same amount of land.
Close those gaps, and farm yields rise by 20 to 30 percent.
That means 20 to 30 percent more food from the same garden or the same field.
The implications for hunger, for health, for household income -- they're obvious.
Let's follow the thread to climate.
We humans need land to grow food.
Unfortunately, forests are often cleared to supply it, and that causes emissions from deforestation.
But if existing farms produce enough food, forests are less likely to be lost.
So there's a ripple effect.
Support women smallholders, realize higher yields, avoid deforestation and sustain the life-giving power of forests.
Project Drawdown estimates that addressing inequity in agriculture could prevent two billion tons of emissions between now and 2050. That's on par with the impact household recycling can have globally.
Addressing this inequity can also help women cope with the challenges of growing food as the climate changes.
There is life force in cultivation.
At last count, 130 million girls are still denied their basic right to attend school.
Gaps are greatest in secondary school classrooms.
Too many girls are missing a vital foundation for life.
Education means better health for women and their children, better financial security, greater agency at home and in society, more capacity to navigate a climate-changing world.
Education can mean options, adaptability, strength.
It can also mean lower emissions.
For a variety of reasons, when we have more years of education, we typically choose to marry later and to have fewer children.
So our families end up being smaller.
What happens at the individual level adds up across the world and over time.
One by one by one, the right to go to school impacts how many human beings live on this planet and impacts its living systems.
That's not why girls should be educated.
It's one meaningful outcome.
Education is one side of a coin.
The other is family planning: access to high-quality, voluntary reproductive health care.
To have children by choice rather than chance is a matter of autonomy and dignity.
Yet in the US, 45 percent of pregnancies are unintended.
Two hundred and fourteen million women in lower-income countries say they want to decide whether and when to become pregnant but aren't using contraception.
Listening to women's needs, addressing those needs, advancing equity and well-being: those must be the aims of family planning, period.
Curbing the growth of our human population is a side effect, though a potent one.
It could dramatically reduce demand for food, transportation, electricity, buildings, goods and all the rest, thereby reducing emissions.
Close the gaps on access to education and family planning, and by mid-century, we may find one billion fewer people inhabiting earth than we would if we do nothing more.
According to Project Drawdown, one billion fewer people could mean we avoid nearly 120 billion tons of emissions.
At that level of impact, gender equity is a top solution to restore a climate fit for life.
At that level of impact, gender equity is on par with wind turbines and solar panels and forests.
There is life force in learning and life force in choice.
Now, let me be clear: this does not mean women and girls are responsible for fixing everything.
(Laughter) Though we probably will.
(Laughter) (Applause) Equity for women in agriculture, education and family planning: these are solutions within a system of drawdown solutions.
Together, they comprise a blueprint of possibility.
And let me be even clearer about this: population cannot be seen in isolation from production or consumption.
Some segments of the human family cause exponentially greater harm, while others suffer outsized injustice.
The most affluent -- we are the most accountable.
We have the most to do.
The gender-climate connection extends beyond negative impacts and beyond powerful solutions.
Women are vital voices and agents for change on this planet, and yet we're too often missing or even barred from the proverbial table.
We're too often ignored or silenced when we speak.
We are too often passed over when plans are laid or investments made.
According to one analysis, just 0.2 percent of philanthropic funds go specifically towards women and the environment, merely 110 million dollars globally, the sum spent by one man on a single Basquiat painting last year.
These dynamics are not only unjust, they are setting us up for failure.
To rapidly, radically reshape society, we need every solution and every solver, every mind, every bit of heart, every set of hands.
We often crave a simple call to action, but this challenge demands more than a fact sheet and more than a checklist.
We need to function more like an ecosystem, finding strength in our diversity.
You know what your superpowers are.
You're an educator, farmer, healer, creator, campaigner, wisdom-keeper.
How might you link arms where you are to move solutions forward?
There is one role I want to ask that all of you play: the role of messenger.
This is a time of great awakening.
We need to break the silence around the condition of our planet; move beyond manufactured debates about climate science; share solutions; speak truth with a broken-open heart; teach that to address climate change, we must make gender equity a reality.
And in the face of a seemingly impossible challenge, women and girls are a fierce source of possibility.
It is a magnificent thing to be alive in a moment that matters so much.
This earth, our home, is calling for us to be bold, reminding us we are all in this together -- women, men, people of all gender identities, all beings.
We are life force, one earth, one chance.
Let's seize it.
Thank you.
(Applause)There are two powerful phenomena unfolding on earth: the rise of global warming and the rise of women and girls.
The link between them is often overlooked, but gender equity is a key answer to our planetary challenge.
Let me explain.
For the last few years, I have been working on an effort called "Project Drawdown.
Gender and climate are inextricably linked.
Drawing down emissions depends on rising up.
First, a bit of context.
We are in a situation of urgency, severity and scope never before faced by humankind.
So far, our response isn't anywhere close to adequate.
We are each part of the planet's living systems, knitted together with almost 7.7 billion human beings and 1.8 million known species.

The most affluent -- we are the most accountable.
It can choose to flip the coin or not, but you don't get to see the outcome.
Next, it's your turn.
You can also choose to flip the coin or not, and your move will not be revealed to your opponent, the computer.
Finally, the computer plays again, and can flip the coin or not, and after these three rounds, the coin is revealed, and if it is heads, the computer wins, if it's tails, you win.
So it's a pretty simple game, and if everybody plays honestly, and the coin is fair, then you have a 50 percent chance of winning this game.
And to confirm that, I asked my students to play this game on our computers, and after many, many tries, their winning rate ended up being 50 percent, or close to 50 percent, as expected.
Sounds like a boring game, right?
But what if you could play this game on a quantum computer?
Now, Las Vegas casinos do not have quantum computers, as far as I know, but IBM has built a working quantum computer.
Here it is.
But what is a quantum computer?
Well, quantum physics describes the behavior of atoms and fundamental particles, like electrons and photons.
So a quantum computer operates by controlling the behavior of these particles, but in a way that is completely different from our regular computers.
So a quantum computer is not just a more powerful version of our current computers, just like a light bulb is not a more powerful candle.
You cannot build a light bulb by building better and better candles. A light bulb is a different technology, based on deeper scientific understanding.
Similarly, a quantum computer is a new kind of device, based on the science of quantum physics, and just like a light bulb transformed society, quantum computers have the potential to impact so many aspects of our lives, including our security needs, our health care and even the internet.
So companies all around the world are working to build these devices, and to see what the excitement is all about, let's play our game on a quantum computer.
So I can log into IBM's quantum computer from right here, which means I can play the game remotely, and so can you.
To make this happen, you may remember getting an email ahead of time, from TED, asking you whether you would choose to flip the coin or not, if you played the game.
Well, actually, we asked you to choose between a circle or a square.
You didn't know it, but your choice of circle meant "flip the coin," and your choice of square was "don't flip.
" We received 372 responses.
Thank you.
That means we can play 372 games against the quantum computer using your choices.
And it's a pretty fast game to play, so I can show you the results right here.
Unfortunately, you didn't do very well.
(Laughter) The quantum computer won almost every game.
It lost a few only because of operational errors in the computer.
(Laughter) So how did it achieve this amazing winning streak?
It seems like magic or cheating, but actually, it's just quantum physics in action.
Here's how it works.
A regular computer simulates heads or tails of a coin as a bit, a zero or a one, or a current flipping on and off inside your computer chip.
A quantum computer is completely different.
A quantum bit has a more fluid, nonbinary identity.
It can exist in a superposition, or a combination of zero and one, with some probability of being zero and some probability of being one.
In other words, its identity is on a spectrum.
For example, it could have a 70 percent chance of being zero and a 30 percent chance of being one or 80-20 or 60-40. The possibilities are endless.
The key idea here is that we have to give up on precise values of zero and one and allow for some uncertainty.
So during the game, the quantum computer creates this fluid combination of heads and tails, zero and one, so that no matter what the player does, flip or no flip, the superposition remains intact.
It's kind of like stirring a mixture of two fluids.
Whether or not you stir, the fluids remain in a mixture, but in its final move, the quantum computer can unmix the zero and one, perfectly recovering heads so that you lose every time.
(Laughter) If you think this is all a bit weird, you are absolutely right.
Regular coins do not exist in combinations of heads and tails.
We do not experience this fluid quantum reality in our everyday lives.
So if you are confused by quantum, don't worry, you're getting it.
(Laughter) But even though we don't experience quantum strangeness, we can see its very real effects in action.
You've seen the data for yourself.
The quantum computer won because it harnessed superposition and uncertainty, and these quantum properties are powerful, not just to win coin games, but also to build future quantum technologies.
So let me give you three examples of potential applications that could change our lives.
First of all, quantum uncertainty could be used to create private keys for encrypting messages sent from one location to another so that hackers could not secretly copy the key perfectly, because of quantum uncertainty.
They would have to break the laws of quantum physics to hack the key.
So this kind of unbreakable encryption is already being tested by banks and other institutions worldwide.
Today, we use more than 17 billion connected devices globally.
Just imagine the impact quantum encryption could have in the future.
Secondly, quantum technologies could also transform health care and medicine.
For example, the design and analysis of molecules for drug development is a challenging problem today, and that's because exactly describing and calculating all of the quantum properties of all the atoms in the molecule is a computationally difficult task, even for our supercomputers.
But a quantum computer could do better, because it operates using the same quantum properties as the molecule it's trying to simulate.
So future large-scale quantum simulations for drug development could perhaps lead to treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's, which affects thousands of lives.
And thirdly, my favorite quantum application is teleportation of information from one location to another without physically transmitting the information.
Sounds like sci-fi, but it is possible, because these fluid identities of the quantum particles can get entangled across space and time in such a way that when you change something about one particle, it can impact the other, and that creates a channel for teleportation.
It's already been demonstrated in research labs and could be part of a future quantum internet.
We don't have such a network as yet, but my team is working on these possibilities, by simulating a quantum network on a quantum computer.
So we have designed and implemented some interesting new protocols such as teleportation among different users in the network and efficient data transmission and even secure voting.
So it's a lot of fun for me, being a quantum physicist.
I highly recommend it.
(Laughter) We get to be explorers in a quantum wonderland.
Who knows what applications we will discover next.
We must tread carefully and responsibly as we build our quantum future. And for me, personally, I don't see quantum physics as a tool just to build quantum computers.
I see quantum computers as a way for us to probe the mysteries of nature and reveal more about this hidden world outside of our experiences.
How amazing that we humans, with our relatively limited access to the universe, can still see far beyond our horizons just using our imagination and our ingenuity.
And the universe rewards us by showing us how incredibly interesting and surprising it is.
The future is fundamentally uncertain, and to me, that is certainly exciting.
Thank you.
(Applause)Let's play a game.
Imagine that you are in Las Vegas, in a casino, and you decide to play a game on one of the casino's computers, just like you might play solitaire or chess.
The computer can make moves in the game, just like a human player.
This is a coin game.
It starts with a coin showing heads, and the computer will play first.
Next, it's your turn.
Finally, the computer plays again, and can flip the coin or not, and after these three rounds, the coin is revealed, and if it is heads, the computer wins, if it's tails, you win.
So it's a pretty simple game, and if everybody plays honestly, and the coin is fair, then you have a 50 percent chance of winning this game.
And to confirm that, I asked my students to play this game on our computers, and after many, many tries, their winning rate ended up being 50 percent, or close to 50 percent, as expected.
But what if you could play this game on a quantum computer?
Now, Las Vegas casinos do not have quantum computers, as far as I know, but IBM has built a working quantum computer.
So a quantum computer is not just a more powerful version of our current computers, just like a light bulb is not a more powerful candle.
You cannot build a light bulb by building better and better candles. A light bulb is a different technology, based on deeper scientific understanding.
Unfortunately, you didn't do very well.
(Laughter) The quantum computer won almost every game.
A quantum bit has a more fluid, nonbinary identity.
In other words, its identity is on a spectrum.
(Laughter) If you think this is all a bit weird, you are absolutely right.
Just imagine the impact quantum encryption could have in the future.
Some women are mosaics.
Being feminine?
Getting married? Having kids?
You don't have to look far to find fantastic exceptions to these rules, but we all share something that makes us women.
Maybe that something is in our brains.
You might have heard theories from last century about how men are better at math than women because they have bigger brains.
These theories have been debunked.
The average man has a brain about three times smaller than the average elephant, but that doesn't mean the average man is three times dumber than an elephant . . . or does it?
(Laughter) There's a new wave of female neuroscientists that are finding important differences between female and male brains in neuron connectivity, in brain structure, in brain activity.
They're finding that the brain is like a patchwork mosaic -- a mixture.
Women have mostly female patches and a few male patches.
With all this new data, what does it mean to be a woman?
This is something that I've been thinking about almost my entire life.
When people learn that I'm a woman who happens to be transgender, they always ask, "How do you know you're a woman?
" As a scientist, I'm searching for a biological basis of gender.
I want to understand what makes me me.
New discoveries at the front edge of science are shedding light on the biomarkers that define gender.
My colleagues and I in genetics, neuroscience, physiology and psychology, we're trying to figure out exactly how gender works.
These vastly different fields share a common connection -- epigenetics.
In epigenetics, we're studying how DNA activity can actually radically and permanently change, even though the sequence stays the same.
DNA is the long, string-like molecule that winds up inside our cells.
There's so much DNA that it actually gets tangled into these knot-like things -- we'll just call them knots.
So external factors change how those DNA knots are formed.
You can think of it like this: inside our cells, there's different contraptions building things, connecting circuits, doing all the things they need to make life happen.
Here's one that's sort of reading the DNA and making RNA.
And then this one is carrying a huge sac of neurotransmitters from one end of the brain cell to the other.
Don't they get hazard pay for this kind of work?
(Laughter) This one is an entire molecular factory -- some say it's the secret to life.
It's call the ribosome.
I've been studying this since 2001. One of the stunning things about our cells is that the components inside them are actually biodegradable.
They dissolve, and then they're rebuilt each day, kind of like a traveling carnival where the rides are taken down and then rebuilt every single day.
A big difference between our cells and the traveling carnival is that in the carnival, there are skilled craftsmen that rebuild the rides each day.
In our cells, there are no such skilled craftsmen, only dumb builder machines that build whatever's written in the plans, no matter what those plans say.
Those plans are the DNA.
The instructions for every nook and cranny inside our cells.
If everything in, say, our brain cells dissolves almost every day, then how can the brain remember anything past one day?
That's where DNA comes in.
DNA is one of the those things that does not dissolve.
But for DNA to remember that something happened, it has to change somehow.
We know the change can't be in the sequence; if it changed sequence all the time, then we might be growing like, a new ear or a new eyeball every single day.
(Laughter) So, instead it changes shape, and that's where those DNA knots come in.
You can think of them like DNA memory.
When something big in our life happens, like a traumatic childhood event, stress hormones flood our brain.
The stress hormones don't affect the sequence of DNA, but they do change the shape.
They affect that part of DNA with the instructions for molecular machines that reduce stress.
That piece of DNA gets wound up into a knot, and now the dumb builder machines can't read the plans they need to build the machines that reduce stress.
That's a mouthful, but it's what's happening on the microscale.
On the macroscale, you practically lose the ability to deal with stress, and that's bad.
And that's how DNA can remember what happens in the past.
This is what I think was happening to me when I first started my gender transition.
I knew I was a woman on the inside, and I wore women's clothes on the outside, but everyone saw me as a man in a dress.
I felt like no matter how many things I try, no one would ever really see me as a woman.
In science, your credibility is everything, and people were snickering in the hallways, giving me stares, looks of disgust -- afraid to be near me.
I remember my first big talk after transition.
It was in Italy.
I'd given prestigious talks before, but this one, I was terrified.
I looked out into the audience, and the whispers started -- the stares, the smirks, the chuckles.
To this day, I still have social anxiety around my experience eight years ago.
I lost hope.
Don't worry, I've had therapy so I'm OK -- I'm OK now.
(Laughter) (Cheers) (Applause) But I felt enough is enough: I'm a scientist, I have a doctorate in astrophysics, I've published in the top journals, in wave-particle interactions, space physics, nucleic acid biochemistry.
I've actually been trained to get to the bottom of things, so -- (Laughter) I went online -- (Applause) So I went online, and I found fascinating research papers.
I learned that these DNA knot things are not always bad.
Actually, the knotting and unknotting -- it's like a complicated computer language.
It programs our bodies with exquisite precision.
So when we get pregnant, our fertilized eggs grow into newborn babies.
This process requires thousands of DNA decisions to happen.
Should an embryo cell become a blood cell?
A heart cell?
A brain cell?
And the decisions happen at different times during pregnancy.
Some in the first trimester, some in the second trimester and some in the third trimester.
To truly understand DNA decision-making, we need to see the process of knot formation in atomic detail.
Even the most powerful microscopes can't see this.
What if we tried to simulate these on a computer?
For that we'd need a million computers to do that.
That's exactly what we have at Los Alamos Labs -- a million computers connected in a giant warehouse.
So here we're showing the DNA making up an entire gene folded into very specific shapes of knots.
For the first time, my team has simulated an entire gene of DNA -- the largest biomolecular simulation performed to date.
For the first time, we're beginning to understand the unsolved problem of how hormones trigger the formation of these knots.
DNA knot formation can be seen beautifully in calico cats.
The decision between orange and black happens early on in the womb, so that orange-and-black patchy pattern, it's an exact readout of what happened when that cat was just a tiny little kitten embryo inside her mom's womb.
And the patchy pattern actually happens in our brains and in cancer.
It's directly related to intellectual disability and breast cancer.
These DNA decisions also happen in other parts of the body.
It turns out that the precursor genitals transform into either female or male during the first trimester of pregnancy.
The precursor brains, on the other hand, transform into female or male during the second trimester of pregnancy.
So the current working model is that a unique mix in my mom's womb caused the precursor genitals to transform one way, but the precursor brain to transform the other way.
Most of epigenetic research has really focused on stress, anxiety, depression -- kind of a downer, kind of bad things.
(Laughter) But nowadays -- the latest stuff -- people are looking at relaxation.
Can that have a positive effect on your DNA?
Right now we're missing key data from mice models.
We know that mice relax, but could they meditate like the Dalai Lama?
Achieve enlightenment?
Could they move stones with their mind like Jedi Master Yoda?
(Yoda voice): Hm, a Jedi mouse must feel the force flow, hm.
(Laughter) (Applause) I wonder if the support I've had since that talk back in Italy has tried to unwind my DNA.
Having a great circle of friends, supportive parents and being in a loving relationship has actually given me strength and hope to help others.
At work I wear a rainbow bracelet.
Sometimes it raises eyebrows, but it also raises awareness.
There's so many transgender people -- especially women of color -- that are just one demeaning comment away from taking their own lives.
Forty percent of us attempt suicide.
If you're listening and you feel like you have no other option, try to call a friend, go online or try to get in a support group.
If you're a woman who's not transgender but you know pain of isolation, of sexual assault -- reach out.
So what does it mean to be a woman?
The latest research is showing that female and male brains do develop differently in the womb, possibly giving us females this innate sense of being a woman.
On the other hand, maybe it's our shared sense of commonality that makes us women.
We come in so many different shapes and sizes that asking what it means to be a woman may not be the right question.
It's like asking a calico cat what it means to be a calico cat.
Maybe becoming a woman means accepting ourselves for who we really are and acknowledging the same in each other.
I see you.
And you've just seen me.
(Applause and cheers)So what does it mean to be a woman?
We all have XX chromosomes, right?
Actually, that's not true.
Some women are mosaics.
They have a mix of chromosome types with X, with XY or with XXX.
If it's not just about our chromosomes, then what is being a woman about?
Being feminine?
Maybe that something is in our brains.
You might have heard theories from last century about how men are better at math than women because they have bigger brains.
They're finding that the brain is like a patchwork mosaic -- a mixture.
Women have mostly female patches and a few male patches.
When people learn that I'm a woman who happens to be transgender, they always ask, "How do you know you're a woman?
" As a scientist, I'm searching for a biological basis of gender.
I want to understand what makes me me.
My colleagues and I in genetics, neuroscience, physiology and psychology, we're trying to figure out exactly how gender works.
In epigenetics, we're studying how DNA activity can actually radically and permanently change, even though the sequence stays the same.
DNA is the long, string-like molecule that winds up inside our cells.
There's so much DNA that it actually gets tangled into these knot-like things -- we'll just call them knots.
You can think of it like this: inside our cells, there's different contraptions building things, connecting circuits, doing all the things they need to make life happen.
And then this one is carrying a huge sac of neurotransmitters from one end of the brain cell to the other.
(Laughter) This one is an entire molecular factory -- some say it's the secret to life.
I've been studying this since 2001. One of the stunning things about our cells is that the components inside them are actually biodegradable.
They dissolve, and then they're rebuilt each day, kind of like a traveling carnival where the rides are taken down and then rebuilt every single day.
DNA is one of the those things that does not dissolve.
You can think of them like DNA memory.
That piece of DNA gets wound up into a knot, and now the dumb builder machines can't read the plans they need to build the machines that reduce stress.
I felt like no matter how many things I try, no one would ever really see me as a woman.
I remember my first big talk after transition.
I'd given prestigious talks before, but this one, I was terrified.
I looked out into the audience, and the whispers started -- the stares, the smirks, the chuckles.
To this day, I still have social anxiety around my experience eight years ago.
Don't worry, I've had therapy so I'm OK -- I'm OK now.
(Laughter) (Cheers) (Applause) But I felt enough is enough: I'm a scientist, I have a doctorate in astrophysics, I've published in the top journals, in wave-particle interactions, space physics, nucleic acid biochemistry.
I've actually been trained to get to the bottom of things, so -- (Laughter) I went online -- (Applause) So I went online, and I found fascinating research papers.
I learned that these DNA knot things are not always bad.
And the decisions happen at different times during pregnancy.
Some in the first trimester, some in the second trimester and some in the third trimester.
For the first time, my team has simulated an entire gene of DNA -- the largest biomolecular simulation performed to date.
DNA knot formation can be seen beautifully in calico cats.
So the current working model is that a unique mix in my mom's womb caused the precursor genitals to transform one way, but the precursor brain to transform the other way.
Right now we're missing key data from mice models.
It's like asking a calico cat what it means to be a calico cat.
It is one piece of bleached Honduras mahogany.
Now let me be clear: this exercise was not about looking at sculpture.
It's about looking and understanding that looking closely can save a life, change your company and even help you understand why your children behave the way they do.
It's a skill that I call visual intelligence, and I use works of art to teach everybody, from everyday people to those for whom looking is the job, like Navy SEALs and homicide detectives and trauma nurses.
The fact is that no matter how skilled you might be at looking, you still have so much to learn about seeing.
Because we all think we get it in a first glance and a sudden flash, but the real skill is in understanding how to look slowly and how to look more carefully.
The talent is in remembering -- in the crush of the daily urgencies that demand our attention -- to step back and look through those lenses to help us see what we've been missing all along.
So how can looking at painting and sculpture help?
Because art is a powerful tool.
It's a powerful tool that engages both sight and insight and reframes our understanding of where we are and what we see.
Here's an example of a work of art that reminded me that visual intelligence -- it's an ongoing learning process and one that really is never mastered.
I came across this quiet, seemingly abstract painting, and I had to step up to it twice, even three times, to understand why it resonated so deeply.
Now, I've seen the Washington Monument in person thousands of times, well aware of the change in the color of marble a third of the way up, but I had never really looked at it out of context or truly as a work of art.
And here, Georgia O'Keeffe's painting of this architectural icon made me realize that if we put our mind to it, it's possible to see everyday things in a wholly new and eye-opening perspective.
Now, there are some skeptics that believe that art just belongs in an art museum.
They believe that it has no practical use beyond its aesthetic value.
I know who they are in every audience I teach.
Their arms are crossed, their legs are crossed, their body language is saying, "What am I going to learn from this lady who talks fast about painting and sculpture?
" So how do I make it relevant for them?
I ask them to look at this work of art, like this portrait by Kumi Yamashita.
And I ask them to step in close, and even closer still, and while they're looking at the work of art, they need to be asking questions about what they see.
And if they ask the right questions, like, "What is this work of art?
Is it a painting?
Is it a sculpture?
What is it made of?
" . . . they will find out that this entire work of art is made of a wooden board, 10,000 nails and one unbroken piece of sewing thread.
Now that might be interesting to some of you, but what does it have to do with the work that these people do?
And the answer is everything.
Because we all interact with people multiple times on a daily basis, and we need to get better at asking questions about what it is that we see.
Learning to frame the question in such a way as to elicit the information that we need to do our jobs, is a critical life skill.
Like the radiologist who told me that looking at the negative spaces in a painting helped her discern more discreet abnormalities in an MRI.
Or the police officer who said that understanding the emotional dynamic between people in a painting helped him to read body language at a domestic violence crime scene, and it enabled him to think twice before drawing and firing his weapon.
And even parents can look to see absences of color in paintings to understand that what their children say to them is as important as what they don't say.
So how do I -- how do I train to be more visually intelligent?
It comes down to four As.
Every new situation, every new problem -- we practice four As.
First, we assess our situation.
We ask, "What do we have in front of us?
" Then, we analyze it.
We say, "What's important?
What do I need?
What don't I need?
" Then, we articulate it in a conversation, in a memo, in a text, in an email.
And then, we act: we make a decision.
We all do this multiple times a day, but we don't realize what a role seeing and looking plays in all of those actions, and how visual intelligence can really improve everything.
So recently, I had a group of counterterrorism officials at a museum in front of this painting.
El Greco's painting, "The Purification of the Temple," in which Christ, in the center, in a sweeping and violent gesture, is expelling the sinners from the temple of prayer.
The group of counterterrorism officials had five minutes with that painting, and in that short amount of time, they had to assess the situation, analyze the details, articulate what, if anything, they would do if they were in that painting.
As you can imagine, observations and insights differed.
Who would they talk to?
Who would be the best witness?
Who was a good potential witness?
Who was lurking?
Who had the most information?
But my favorite comment came from a seasoned cop who looked at the central figure and said, "You see that guy in the pink?
" -- referring to Christ -- he said, "I'd collar him, he's causing all the trouble.
" (Laughter) So looking at art gives us a perfect vehicle to rethink how we solve problems without the aid of technology.
Looking at the work of Felix Gonzalez-Torres, you see two clocks in perfect synchronicity.
The hour, minute and second hand perfectly aligned.
They are installed side by side and they're touching, and they are entitled "'Untitled' (Perfect Lovers).
" But closer analysis makes you realize that these are two battery-operated clocks, which in turn makes you understand -- "Hey, wait a minute . . . One of those batteries is going to stop before the other.
One of those clocks is going to slow down and die before the other and it's going to alter the symmetry of the artwork.
" Just articulating that thought process includes the necessity of a contingency plan.
You need to have contingencies for the unforeseen, the unexpected and the unknown, whenever and however they may happen.
Now, using art to increase our visual intelligence involves planning for contingencies, understanding the big picture and the small details and noticing what's not there.
" It may sound counterintuitive to say what isn't there, but it's really a very valuable tool.
When a detective who had learned about visual intelligence in North Carolina was called to the crime scene, it was a boating fatality, and the eyewitness told this detective that the boat had flipped over and the occupant had drowned underneath.
Now, instinctively, crime scene investigators look for what is apparent, but this detective did something different.
He looked for what wasn't there, which is harder to do.
And he raised the question: if the boat had really tipped flipped over -- as the eyewitness said that it did -- how come the papers that were kept at one end of the boat were completely dry?
Based on that one small but critical observation, the investigation shifted from accidental death to homicide.
Now, equally important to saying what isn't there is the ability to find visual connections where they may not be apparent.
Like Marie Watt's totem pole of blankets.
It illustrates that finding hidden connections in everyday objects can resonate so deeply.
The artist collected blankets from all different people in her community, and she had the owners of the blankets write, on a tag, the significance of the blanket to the family.
Some of the blankets had been used for baby blankets, some of them had been used as picnic blankets, some of them had been used for the dog.
We all have blankets in our homes and understand the significance that they play.
But similarly, I instruct new doctors: when they walk into a patient's room, before they pick up that medical chart, just look around the room.
Are there balloons or cards, or that special blanket on the bed?
That tells the doctor there's a connection to the outside world.
If that patient has someone in the outside world to assist them and help them, the doctor can implement the best care with that connection in mind.
In medicine, people are connected as humans before they're identified as doctor and patient.
But this method of enhancing perception -- it need not be disruptive, and it doesn't necessitate an overhaul in looking.
Like Jorge Méndez Blake's sculpture of building a brick wall above Kafka's book "El Castillo" shows that more astute observation can be subtle and yet invaluable.
You can discern the book, and you can see how it disrupted the symmetry of the bricks directly above it, but by the time you get to the end of the sculpture, you can no longer see the book.
But looking at the work of art in its entirety, you see that the impact of the work's disruption on the bricks is nuanced and unmistakable.
One thought, one idea, one innovation can alter an approach, change a process and even save lives.
(Laughter) Things go wrong.
And don't misunderstand me, I'd eat that doughnut in a minute.
(Laughter) But we need to understand the consequences of what it is that we observe, and we need to convert observable details into actionable knowledge.
Like Jennifer Odem's sculpture of tables standing sentinel on the banks of the Mississippi River in New Orleans, guarding against the threat of post-Katrina floodwaters and rising up against adversity, we too have the ability to act affirmatively and affect positive change.
I have been mining the world of art to help people across the professional spectrum to see the extraordinary in the everyday, to articulate what is absent and to be able to inspire creativity and innovation, no matter how small.
And most importantly, to forge human connections where they may not be apparent, empowering us all to see our work and the world writ large with a new set of eyes.
Thank you.
(Applause)Take a look at this work of art. What is it that you see?
At first glance, it looks to be a grandfather clock with a sheet thrown over it and a rope tied around the center.
But a first look always warrants a second.
Look again.
What do you see now?
If you look more closely, you'll realize that this entire work of art is made from one piece of sculpture.
There is no clock, there is no rope, and there is no sheet.
It is one piece of bleached Honduras mahogany.
Now let me be clear: this exercise was not about looking at sculpture.
The fact is that no matter how skilled you might be at looking, you still have so much to learn about seeing.
The talent is in remembering -- in the crush of the daily urgencies that demand our attention -- to step back and look through those lenses to help us see what we've been missing all along.

Thank you.
And I'll be 50 this month, and it took me that long to realize that she was that big of an inspiration.
I want to play a little bit for mom and your moms as well, actually. (Cello music) (Music ends) You know, when you normally hear a cello, you think of this. (Plays Bach Cello Suite No. 1) We're not going to do that today.
(Laughter and applause) (Drums) (Cello) Hey!
(Looped samples of onstage sounds) (Cello music and looped samples) (Music ends) (Applause and cheers)(Cello music) (Music ends) On the flight here, I was reminded about my mom.
I'm a self-taught cellist, I've never had a lesson. I studied double bass, but I just picked up the cello and started playing because I love doing it. But my mom was an inspiration to me.
I did not realize she was an inspiration, because she got her music degree through a mail-order course, the US School of Music.
While raising two kids, she received a lesson a week in the mail, and practiced.
And at the end of a couple of years, she put on a recital.
And I'll be 50 this month, and it took me that long to realize that she was that big of an inspiration.
I'm just going to keep -- yeah, thanks, mom.
I want to play a little bit for mom and your moms as well, actually. (Cello music) (Music ends) You know, when you normally hear a cello, you think of this. (Plays Bach Cello Suite No. 1) We're not going to do that today.
(Laughter and applause) (Drums) (Cello) Hey!
(Laughter) How many goals?
Maybe something tried and tested, like three, seven or 10. No, let's pick a prime number higher than 10. Seventeen goals.
I congratulate those of you who've memorized them already.
For the rest of us, here they are.
Seventeen goals ranging from ending poverty to inclusive cities to sustainable fisheries; all a comprehensive plan for the future of our world.
But sadly, a plan without the data to measure it.
So how are we going to track progress?
Well, I'm going to use today the Social Progress Index.
It's a measure of the quality of life of countries, ranging from the basic needs of survival -- food, water, shelter, safety -- through to the foundations of well-being -- education, information, health and the environment -- and opportunity -- rights, freedom of choice, inclusiveness and access to higher education.
Now, the Social Progress Index doesn't look like the SDGs, but fundamentally, it's measuring the same concepts, and the Social Progress Index has the advantage that we have the data.
We have 51 indicators drawn from trusted sources to measure these concepts.
And also, what we can do because it's an index, is add together all those indicators to give us an aggregate score about how we're performing against the total package of the SDGs.
Now, one caveat.
The Social Progress Index is a measure of quality of life.
We're not looking at whether this can be achieved within the planet's environmental limits.
You will need other tools to do that.
So how are we doing on the SDGs?
Well, I'm going to put the SDGs on a scale of zero to 100. And zero is the absolute worst score on each of those 51 indicators: absolute social progress, zero.
And then 100 is the minimum standard required to achieve those SDGs.
A hundred is where we want to get to by 2030. So, where did we start on this journey?
Fortunately, not at zero.
In 2015, the world score against the SDGs was 69.1. Some way on the way there but quite a long way to go.
Now let me also emphasize that this world forecast, which is based on data from 180 countries, is population weighted.
So China has more weight in than Comoros; India has more weight in than Iceland.
But we could unpack this and see how the countries are doing.
And the country today that is closest to achieving the SDGs is Denmark.
And the country with the furthest to go is Central African Republic.
And everyone else is somewhere in between.
So the challenge for the SDGs is to try and sweep all these dots across to the right, to 100 by 2030. Can we get there?
Well, with the Social Progress Index, we've got some time series data.
So we have some idea of the trend that the countries are on, on which we can build some projections.
So let's have a look.
Let's start with our top-performing country, Denmark.
And yes, I'm pleased to say that Denmark is forecast to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Maybe not surprising, but I'll take a win.
Let's look at some of the other richer countries of the world -- the G7. And we find that Germany and Japan will get there or thereabouts.
But Canada, France, the UK and Italy are all going to fall short.
And the United States?
Quite some way back.
Now, this is sort of worrying news.
But these are the richest countries in the world, not the most populous.
So let's take a look now at the biggest countries in the world, the ones that will most affect whether or not we achieve the SDGs.
And here they are -- countries in the world with a population of higher than 100 million, ranging from China to Ethiopia.
Obviously, the US and Japan would be in that list, but we've looked at them already.
So here we are.
The biggest countries in the world; the dealbreakers for the SDGs.
And the country that's going to make most progress towards the SDGs is Mexico.
Mexico is going to get to about 87, so just shy of where the US is going to get but quite some way off our SDG target.
Russia comes next.
Then China and Indonesia.
Then Brazil -- might've expected Brazil to do a bit better.
Philippines, and then a step down to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, and then Ethiopia.
So none of these countries are going to hit the SDGs.
And we can then take these numbers in all the countries of the world to give ourselves a world forecast on achieving that total package of the SDGs.
So remember, in 2015 we started at 69.1. I'm pleased to say that over the last three years, we have made some progress.
In 2018, we've hit 70.5, and if we project that rate of progress forward to 2030, that's going to get us to 75.2, which is obviously a long way short of our target.
Indeed, on current trends, we won't hit the 2030 targets until 2094. Now, I don't know about you, but I certainly don't want to wait that long.
So what can we do about this?
Well, the first thing to do is we've got to call out the rich countries.
Here are the countries closest to the SDGs, with the greatest resources, and they're falling short.
Maybe they think that this is like the Old World where goals for the UN are just for poor countries and not for them.
Well, you're wrong.
The SDGs are for every country, and it's shameful that these wealthy countries are falling short.
Every country needs a plan to implement the SDGs and deliver them for their citizens.
G7, other rich countries -- get your act together.
The second thing we can do is look a bit further into the data and see where there are opportunities to accelerate progress or there are negative trends that we can reverse.
So I'm going to take you into three areas.
One where we're doing quite well, one where we really should be doing better and another where we've got some real problems.
Let's start with the good news, and I want to talk about what we call nutrition and basic medical care.
This covers SDG 2 on no hunger and the basic elements of SDG 3 on health, so maternal and child mortality, infectious diseases, etc . . . This is an area where most of the rich world has hit the SDGs.
And we also find, looking at our big countries, that the most advanced have got pretty close.
Here are our 11 big countries, and if you look at the top, Brazil and Russia are pretty close to the SDG target.
But at the bottom -- Ethiopia, Pakistan -- a long way to go.
That's where we are in 2018. What's our trajectory?
On the current trajectory, how far are we going to get by 2030? Well, let's have a look.
Well, what we see is a lot of progress.
See Bangladesh in the middle.
If Bangladesh maintains its current rate of progress, it could get very close to that SDG target.
And Ethiopia at the bottom is making a huge amount of progress at the moment.
If that can be maintained, Ethiopia could get a long way.
We add this all up for all the countries of the world and our projection is a score of 94.5 by 2030. And if countries like the Philippines, which have grown more slowly, could accelerate progress, then we could get a lot closer.
So there are reasons to be optimistic about SDGs 2 and 3. But there's another very basic area of the SDGs where we're doing less well, which is SDG 6, on water and sanitation.
Again, it's an SDG where most of the rich countries have already achieved the targets.
And again, for our big countries -- our big 11 emerging countries, we see that some of the countries, like Russia and Mexico, are very close to the target, but Nigeria and other countries are a very long way back.
So how are we doing on this target?
What progress are we going to make over the next 12 years based on the current direction of travel?
Well, here we go . . . and yes, there is some progress.
Our top four countries are all hitting the SDG targets -- some are moving forward quite quickly.
But it's not enough to really move us forward significantly.
What we see is that for the world as a whole, we're forecasting a score of around 85, 86 by 2030 -- not fast enough.
Now, obviously this is not good news, but I think what this data also shows is that we could be doing a lot better. Water and sanitation is a solved problem.
It's about scaling that solution everywhere.
So if we could accelerate progress in some of those countries who are improving more slowly -- Nigeria, the Philippines, etc. -- then we could get a lot closer to the goal.
Indeed, I think SDG 6 is probably the biggest opportunity of all the SDGs for a step change.
So that's an area we could do better.
Let's look finally at an area where we are struggling, which is what we call personal rights and inclusiveness.
This is covering concepts across a range of SDGs.
SDG 1 on poverty, SDG 5 on gender equality, SDG 10 on inequality, SDG 11 on inclusive cities and SDG 16 on peace and justice.
So across those SDGs there are themes around rights and inclusiveness, and those may seem less immediate or pressing than things like hunger and disease, but rights and inclusion are critical to an agenda of no one left behind.
So how are we doing on those issues?
Let's start off with personal rights.
What I'm going to do first is show you our big countries in 2015. So here they are, and I've put the USA and Japan back in, so it's our 13 biggest countries in the world.
And we see a wide range of scores.
The United States at the top with Japan hitting the goals; China a long way behind.
So what's been our direction of travel on the rights agenda over the last three years?
Let's have a look.
Well, what we see is actually pretty ugly.
The majority of the countries are standing still or moving backwards, and big countries like Brazil, India, China, Bangladesh have all seen significant declines.
This is worrying.
Let's have a look now at inclusiveness.
And inclusiveness is looking at things like violence and discrimination against minorities, gender equity, LGBT inclusion, etc. . . And as a result, we see that the scores for our big countries are generally lower.
Every country, rich and poor alike, is struggling with building an inclusive society.
But what's our direction of travel?
Are we building more inclusive countries?
Let's sum this up now for the world as a whole.
How I've depressed you . . . (Laughter) I hope not because I think what we do see is that progress is happening in a lot of places and there are opportunities for accelerating progress.
We are living in a world that is tantalizingly close to ensuring that no one need die of hunger or malaria or diarrhea.
If we can focus our efforts, mobilize resources, galvanize the political will, that step change is possible.
But in focusing on those really basic, solvable SDGs, we mustn't forget the whole package.
The goals are an unwieldy set of indicators, goals and targets, but they also include the challenges our world faces.
The fact that the SDGs are focusing attention on the fact that we face a crisis in personal rights and inclusiveness is a positive.
Thank you.
(Applause)In 2015, the leaders of the world made a big promise.
A promise that over the next 15 years, the lives of billions of people are going to get better with no one left behind.
That promise is the Sustainable Development Goals -- the SDGs.
We're now three years in; a fifth of the way into the journey.
The clock is ticking.
If we offtrack now, it's going to get harder and harder to hit those goals.
So what I want to do for you today is give you a snapshot on where we are today, some projections on where we're heading and some ideas on things we might need to do differently.
Now, the SDGs are of course spectacularly complicated.
I would expect nothing less from the United Nations.
I congratulate those of you who've memorized them already.
But sadly, a plan without the data to measure it.
So how are we going to track progress?
It's a measure of the quality of life of countries, ranging from the basic needs of survival -- food, water, shelter, safety -- through to the foundations of well-being -- education, information, health and the environment -- and opportunity -- rights, freedom of choice, inclusiveness and access to higher education.
And also, what we can do because it's an index, is add together all those indicators to give us an aggregate score about how we're performing against the total package of the SDGs.
We're not looking at whether this can be achieved within the planet's environmental limits.
You will need other tools to do that.
And then 100 is the minimum standard required to achieve those SDGs.
A hundred is where we want to get to by 2030. So, where did we start on this journey?
Fortunately, not at zero.
And the country today that is closest to achieving the SDGs is Denmark.
So the challenge for the SDGs is to try and sweep all these dots across to the right, to 100 by 2030. Can we get there?
So let's have a look.
The second thing we can do is look a bit further into the data and see where there are opportunities to accelerate progress or there are negative trends that we can reverse.
See Bangladesh in the middle.
If Bangladesh maintains its current rate of progress, it could get very close to that SDG target.
We add this all up for all the countries of the world and our projection is a score of 94.5 by 2030. And if countries like the Philippines, which have grown more slowly, could accelerate progress, then we could get a lot closer.
Well, here we go . . . and yes, there is some progress.
What we see is that for the world as a whole, we're forecasting a score of around 85, 86 by 2030 -- not fast enough.
Well, what we see is actually pretty ugly.
Maybe new medicines, new modes of transportation, new ways to communicate, sustainable economies and maybe even a world at peace.
Right now, too few of them are.
My favorite part of my job at UNICEF is a chance to talk to, meet with and hear from young people all around the world.
And they tell me about their hopes and dreams.
And they have amazing hopes and dreams for what they'll accomplish in their lives.
But what they're also telling me is that they have fears.
They feel that they're facing a series of urgent crises.
A crisis of demographics, a crisis of education, a crisis of employment, a crisis of violence and a crisis for girls.
If you look at these crises, you realize that they're urgent and they need to be addressed now.
Because they tell us that they're worried.
They're worried that they might not get the education that they need.
And you know what?
They're right.
Two hundred million adolescents are out of school worldwide, about the population of Brazil.
And those that are in school feel that they may not be getting the right skills.
Globally, six in 10 children and young people do not meet the minimum proficiency level for reading and mathematics.
No country can be successful if nearly half of its population of young people are unable to read or write.
And what about the lucky few who are in secondary school?
Many of them are dropping out because they're worried that they're not getting skills that they can use to make a livelihood.
And sometimes, their parents can no longer afford the fees.
It's a tragedy.
And young people are also telling me that they're worried about employment, that they won't be able to find a job.
And again, they're right.
Every month, 10 million young people reach working age.
It's a staggering number.
Some will go on for further education, but many will enter the workforce.
And our world is not creating 10 million new jobs each month.
The competition is fierce for the jobs that are available.
So, imagine being a young person today, needing a job, seeking a livelihood, ready to build a future, and opportunities are hard to find.
Young people are also telling me that they're worried that they're not getting the skills that they need.
And again, they're right.
We are finding ourselves at a time in the world when the world is changing so fast for work.
We're in the fourth industrial revolution. Young people do not want to be on the farms and in rural communities.
They want to go to the cities.
They want to learn future skills for future work.
They want to learn digital technology and green technologies.
They want to have a chance to learn modern agriculture.
They want to learn business and entrepreneurship, so that they can create a business of their own.
They want to be nurses and radiologists and pharmacists and doctors.
And they want to have all of the skills that they'll need for the future.
They also want to learn the trades, like construction and electricians.
These are all the professions that a country needs, as well as the professions that have not been invented yet.
And young people are also telling me that they're worried about violence.
At home, online, in school, in their communities.
And again, they're right.
A young person can have hundreds of friends on social media, but when they need to find a friendly face, someone who can be there as their friend, to talk to, they do not find one.
They face bullying, harassment and more.
And hundreds of millions are facing exploitation and abuse, and violence.
Every seven minutes, an adolescent boy or girl somewhere in the world is killed by an act of violence.
And girls are telling me that they're especially worried about their futures.
And sadly, they're right, too.
Girls face prejudice and discrimination.
They face early childhood marriage and they face life-threatening early pregnancy.
Imagine a population of the United States. Now double it.
That's the number of women who were married before their 18th birthday.
Six hundred and fifty million.
And many were mothers while they were still children themselves. One out of every three women will face physical abuse or sexual abuse in her lifetime.
So, no wonder girls are worried about their futures.
These urgent crises may not be a reality in your life or in your neighborhood.
And perhaps you've had opportunities for a good education and for marketable skills, and for getting a job.
And maybe you've never faced violence, or prejudice, or discrimination. But there are tens of millions of young people who are not so lucky.
And they are sounding the alarm for their futures.
And that is why UNICEF and our many public and private partners are launching a new global initiative.
Young people themselves have named it.
And it's called Generation Unlimited or Gen-U or Gen you.
So, what they're saying is, it's our time, it's our turn, it's our future.
Our goal is very straightforward.
We want every young person in school, learning, training, or age-appropriate employment by the year 2030. This goal is urgent, it's necessary, it's ambitious.
But we think it's also achievable.
So we're calling out for cutting-edge solutions and new ideas.
Ideas that will give young people a fighting chance for their futures.
We don't know all the answers, so we're reaching out to businesses and governments, and nonprofits, and academia, and communities, and innovators for help.
Gen-U is to be an open platform, where people can come and share their ideas and solutions about what works, what does not work, and importantly, what might work.
So if we can take these ideas and add a little bit of seed money, and add some good partners, and add good political will, we think they can scale up to reach thousands and millions of people around the world.
And with this project, we're also going to do something new. We're going to co-design and co-create with young people.
So with Gen-U, they're going to be in the driver's seat, steering us all along the way.
In Argentina, there's a program where we connect students who are in rural, remote, hard to reach mountainous communities, with something they've seldom seen: a secondary school teacher.
So these students come to a classroom, they're joined by a community teacher and they're connected to urban schools online.
And there is the secondary school teacher, who is teaching them about digital technology and a good secondary school education, without them ever having to leave their own communities.
And in South Africa, there's a program called Techno Girls.
And these are girls from disadvantaged neighborhoods who are studying the STEM program area: science, technology, engineering and math.
And they have a chance to job shadow.
This is the way that they then can see themselves in jobs that are in engineering, in science, and maybe in the space program.
In Bangladesh, we have partners who are training tens of thousands of young people in the trades, so that they can become motorcycle repair people, or mobile phone service people.
But these are a chance to see their own livelihoods.
And maybe even to have a business of their own.
And in Vietnam, there's a program where we are pairing young entrepreneurs with the needs in their own local communities.
So with this program, a group gathered and they decided that they would solve the problem of transportation for people with disabilities in their communities.
So with a mentor and a bit of seed funding, they've now developed a new app to help the whole community.
And I've seen how these programs can make a difference.
And when you see these girls, smiles on their faces, the hot lights in their eyes, they are so excited, they have hope for the future.
They want to change the world.
And now, with this program and these mentors, they'll be able to do it.
But these ideas and programs are just a start.
They'll only reach a fraction of the young people that we need to reach.
We want to take these ideas and find ways to scale them up.
To reach more young people in more communities, in more places around the world.
And we want to dream big.
Could every school, everywhere in the world, no matter how remote or mountainous, or even if it's in a refugee camp, could they be connected to the internet?
Could we have instant translation for young people, so that you could get a good education in your own language, anywhere in the world?
And would it be possible that we could connect the education in your school with skills that you're going to need to get a job in your own community?
So that you actually can move from school to work.
And more.
Can each one of us help?
In our everyday lives and in our workplaces, are there ways that we could support young people?
Young people are asking us for apprenticeships, for job shadowing, for internships. Could we do this?
Young people are also asking us for work-study programs, places where they can learn and earn.
Could we do this and could we reach out to a community that's nearby, that's less advantaged, and help them?
Young people are also saying that they want to help other young people.
They want more space and more voice, so that they can gather to help each other.
In HIV centers, in refugee camps, but also to stop online bullying and early child marriage.
We need ideas, we need ideas that are big and small, ideas that are local and global.
This, in the end, is our responsibility.
A massive generation of young people are about to inherit our world.
It is our duty to leave a legacy of hope and opportunity for them but also with them. Young people are 25 percent of our population.
But they are 100 percent of our future. And they're calling out for a fighting chance to build a better world.
So their call should be our calling.
The calling of our time.
The time is now, the need is urgent.
And 1.8 billion young people are waiting.
Thank you. (Applause)Today, there are 1.8 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 in the world.
It is the largest cohort in human history.
Meeting their needs will be a big challenge.
But it's also a big opportunity.
They hold our shared future in their hands.
Every day, we read about young people lending their ideas and passions to fighting for change, social change, political change, change in their communities.
Imagine what they'll create: breakthroughs, inventions.
Maybe new medicines, new modes of transportation, new ways to communicate, sustainable economies and maybe even a world at peace.
But this opportunity, this youth dividend, is not a given.
One point eight billion young women and young men are standing at the door of adulthood. Are they ready?
Right now, too few of them are.
My favorite part of my job at UNICEF is a chance to talk to, meet with and hear from young people all around the world.
But what they're also telling me is that they have fears.
They feel that they're facing a series of urgent crises.

Six hundred and fifty million.

These tools have given us a clearer view of just how complex the parasite really is.
People who are frequently infected with malaria learn to deal with it.
They get the infection, but they don't get ill.
The recipe is encoded in antibodies.
My team went back to our complex parasite, probed it with samples from Africans who had overcome malaria to answer the question: "What does a successful antibody response look like?
" We found over 200 proteins, many of which are not on the radar for malaria vaccines.
My research community may be missing out important parts of the parasite.
Until recently, when one had identified a protein of interest, they tested whether it might be important for a vaccine by conducting a cohort study.
This typically involved about 300 participants in a village in Africa, whose samples were analyzed to see whether antibodies to the protein would predict who got malaria and who did not.
In the past 30 years, these studies have tested a small number of proteins in relatively few samples and usually in single locations.
The results have not been consistent.
My team essentially collapsed 30 years of this type of research into one exciting experiment, conducted over just three months.
Innovatively, we assembled 10,000 samples from 15 locations in seven African countries, spanning time, age and the variable intensity of malaria experienced in Africa.
We used omics intelligence to prioritize our parasite proteins, synthesize them in the lab and in short, recreated the malaria parasite on a chip.
We did this in Africa, and we're very proud of that.
(Applause) The chip is a small glass slide, but it gives us incredible power.
We simultaneously gathered data on over 100 antibody responses.
What are we looking for?
The recipe behind a successful antibody response, so that we can predict what might make a good malaria vaccine.
We're also trying to figure out exactly what antibodies do to the parasite.
How do they kill it?
Do they attack from multiple angles?
Is there synergy?
How much antibody do you need?
Our studies suggest that having a bit of one antibody won't be enough.
It might take high concentrations of antibodies against multiple parasite proteins.
We're also learning that antibodies kill the parasite in multiple ways, and studying any one of these in isolation may not adequately reflect reality.
Just like we can now see the parasite in greater definition, my team and I are focused on understanding how our bodies overcome this complexity.
We believe that this could provide the breakthroughs that we need to make malaria history through vaccination.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Shoham Arad: OK, how close are we actually to a malaria vaccine?
Faith Osier: We're just at the beginning of a process to try and understand what we need to put in the vaccine before we actually start making it.
So, we're not really close to the vaccine, but we're getting there.
SA: And we're hopeful.
FO: And we're very hopeful.
SA: Tell me about SMART, tell me what does it stand for and why is it important to you?
FO: So SMART stands for South-South Malaria Antigen Research Partnership.
The South-South is referring to us in Africa, looking sideways to each other in collaboration, in contrast to always looking to America and looking to Europe, when there is quite some strength within Africa.
So in SMART, apart from the goal that we have, to develop a malaria vaccine, we are also training African scientists, because the burden of disease in Africa is high, and you need people who will continue to push the boundaries in science, in Africa.
SA: Yes, yes, correct.
(Applause) OK, one last question.
Tell me, I know you mentioned this a little bit, but how would things actually change if there were a malaria vaccine?
FO: We would save half a million lives every year.
Two hundred million cases. It's estimated that malaria costs Africa 12 billion US dollars a year.
So this is economics.
Africa would simply thrive.
SA: OK.
Thank you, Faith.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)There are 200 million clinical cases of falciparum malaria in Africa every year, resulting in half a million deaths.
I would like to talk to you about malaria vaccines.
The ones that we have made to date are simply not good enough.
Why?
We've been working at it for 100 plus years.
When we started, technology was limited.
We could see just a tiny fraction of what the parasite really looked like.
Today, we are awash with technology, advanced imaging and omics platforms -- genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics.
These tools have given us a clearer view of just how complex the parasite really is.
However, in spite of this, our approach to vaccine design has remained pretty rudimentary.
To make a good vaccine, we must go back to basics to understand how our bodies handle this complexity.
The recipe is encoded in antibodies.
My research community may be missing out important parts of the parasite.
Until recently, when one had identified a protein of interest, they tested whether it might be important for a vaccine by conducting a cohort study.
This typically involved about 300 participants in a village in Africa, whose samples were analyzed to see whether antibodies to the protein would predict who got malaria and who did not.

It might take high concentrations of antibodies against multiple parasite proteins.
We believe that this could provide the breakthroughs that we need to make malaria history through vaccination.
FO: So SMART stands for South-South Malaria Antigen Research Partnership.
There is more opportunity to build companies than ever before.
But the financial systems designed to fund that innovation, venture capital, they haven't evolved in the past 20 to 30 years.
Venture capital was designed to pour large sums of money into a small number of companies that can sell for over a billion dollars.
It was not designed to sprinkle capital across many companies that have the potential to succeed but for less, like my own.
That limits the number of ideas that get funded, the number of companies that are created and who can actually receive that funding to grow.
And I think it inspires a tough question: What's our goal with entrepreneurship?
If our goal is to create a tiny number of billion-dollar companies, let's stick with venture capital, it's working.
But if our goal is to inspire innovation and empower more people to build companies of all sizes, we need a new way to fund those ideas. We need a more flexible system that doesn't squeeze entrepreneurs and investors into one rigid financial outcome.
We need to democratize access to capital.
In the summer of 2017, I went out to San Francisco, to join a tech accelerator with 30 other companies.
The accelerator was supposed to teach us how to raise venture capital.
But when I got out there, the startup community was buzzing about ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings.
For the first time, ICOs had raised more money for young startups than venture capital had.
It was the first week of the program.
Tequila Friday.
And the founders couldn't stop talking.
"I'm going to raise an ICO.
" "I'm going to raise an ICO.
" Until one guy goes, "How cool if we did this all together?
We should do an ICO that combines the value of all of our companies and raise money as a group.
" At that point, I had to ask the obvious question, "Guys, what's an ICO?
" ICOs were a way for young companies to raise money by issuing a digital currency tied to the value and services that the company provides.
The currency acts similar to shares in a company, like on the public stock market, increasing in value as it's traded online.
Most important, ICOs expanded the investor pool, from a few hundred venture capital firms to millions of everyday people, excited to invest.
This market represented more money.
It represented more investors.
Which meant a greater likelihood to get funded.
I was sold.
The idea, though, of doing it together still seemed a little crazy.
Startups compete with each other for investment, it takes hundreds of meetings to get a check.
That I would spend my precious 15 minutes in front of an investor talking not just about my own company, but all the companies in the batch, was unprecedented.
But the idea caught on.
And we decided to cooperate, rather than compete.
Every company put 10 percent of their equity into a communal pool that we then split into tradable cryptocurrency that investors could buy and sell.
Six months and four law firms later -- (Laughter) in January 2018, we launched the very first ICO that represented the value of nearly 30 companies and an entirely new way to raise capital.
We got a lot of press.
My favorite headline about us read, "VCs, read this and weep.
" (Laughter) Our fund was naturally more diverse.
Twenty percent of the founders were women.
Fifty percent were international.
The investors were more excited, too.
They had a chance to get better returns, because we took out the middleman fees of venture capital.
And they could take their money and reinvest it, potentially funding more new ideas faster.
I believe this creates a virtuous cycle of capital that allows many more entrepreneurs to succeed.
Because access to capital is access to opportunity.
And we have only just begun to imagine what democratizing access to capital will do.
I would have never thought that my own search for funding would lead me to this stage, having helped nearly 30 companies get investment.
Imagine if other entrepreneurs tried to invent new ways to access capital rather than following the traditional route.
It would change what gets built, who builds it and the long-term impact on the economy.
And I believe that's way more exciting than just trying to invest in the next billion-dollar startup.
Thank you.
(Applause)When I was raising investment for my startup, a venture capitalist said to me, "Ashwini, I think you're going to raise a few million dollars.
And your company -- it's going to sell for 50 to 70 million.
You're going to be really excited.
Your early investors are going to be really excited.
And I'm going to be really upset.
So I'm not going to invest in this deal.
" I remember just being dumbstruck.
Who would be unhappy with putting four or five million dollars into a company and having it sell for 50 to 70 million?
I was a first-time founder.
I didn't have a wealthy network of individuals to turn to for investment, so I went to venture capitalists the most common form of investor in a technology company.
But I'd never taken the time to understand what was motivating that VC to invest.
I believe we're living in a golden era of entrepreneurship.
There is more opportunity to build companies than ever before.
If our goal is to create a tiny number of billion-dollar companies, let's stick with venture capital, it's working.
But if our goal is to inspire innovation and empower more people to build companies of all sizes, we need a new way to fund those ideas. We need a more flexible system that doesn't squeeze entrepreneurs and investors into one rigid financial outcome.

And for those of them who are trying to migrate to Europe -- because that's what it is all about, they are trying to migrate to Europe to find a job.
Going through Libya.
For 300 dollars, maybe sometimes 500 dollars.
Sometimes I hear stories of bodies that fall off an airplane.
Somebody hid in the landing gear of a plane or in the cargo section of a plane, and then you find them frozen to death.
Wouldn't you be haunted if, like me, from the moment you were a little girl, you hear these stories and they keep repeating themselves, over and over and over?
Wouldn't you be haunted?
That's my case.
And at the same time, you know, as my people are dying, my culture is also dying.
There, I said it.
Because, you know, we have this culture inferiority, which means that anything that comes from us is not good enough.
But you know, in my situation, and because I was raised to criticize by creating, it's Michelangelos.
My father said, "Do not come to me with problems unless you thought of a couple alternatives.
They don't have to be right, but I just want to know that you thought of something.
" So, I have this attitude in life -- something is wrong, find a way to fix it.
And that's why I start the businesses that I start, that's usually consumer brands, that have embedded in them the very best of my African culture.
And what I do is it's all packaged, 21st century, world-class tendered, and I bring that to one of the most sophisticated markets in the world, which is the US.
First company was a beverage company, second one is a skin care company, third one is launching next month, and they all have that in common.
So, why are these people leaving?
They're leaving because they have no jobs.
They're leaving because where they are, there's no jobs.
So . . . But poverty, that's really striking them, is the root cause of why they're leaving.
Now, why are people poor?
People are poor because they have no money.
You have no money because you have no source of income.
And for most of us, what is a source of income? For most of us, what is our source of income, what is it, tell me?
Jobs, thank you.
Where do jobs come from?
Come from where?
Businesses, thank you.
Don't you think that it makes sense?
That's why we're poor.
We're poor because it is literally impossible to do businesses in these countries of ours.
But I'm going to tell you exactly what it means on the ground for someone like me.
I have a manufacturing facility in Senegal.
Did you know that for all my raw material that I can't find in the country, I have to pay a 45 percent tariff on everything that comes in?
Forty-five percent tariff.
Do you know that, even to look for fine cardboard to ship my finished products to the US, I can't find new, finished cardboard? Impossible. Because the distributors are not going to come here to start their business, because it makes no sense, either.
So right now, I have to mobilize 3000 dollars' worth of cardboard in my warehouse, so that I can have cardboard, and they won't arrive for another five weeks.
The fact that we are stifled with the most nonsensical laws out there.
That's why we can't run businesses.
It's like swimming through molasses.
So, what can you do about that?
I told you today that someone said to me words that marked me, because I explained the same thing to my employees in Senegal.
And one of them started crying -- her name is Yahara.
She started crying.
I said, "Why are you crying?
" She said, "I'm crying because I had come to believe -- always seeing us represented as poor people -- I had come to believe that maybe, yes, maybe we are inferior.
Because, otherwise, how do you explain that we're always in the begging situation?
" That's what broke my heart.
But at the same time that she said that, because of how I explained just what I explained to you, she said, "But now, I know that I am not the problem.
It is my environment in which I live, that's my problem.
" I said, "Yes.
" And that's what gave me hope -- that once people get it, they now change their outlook on life.
Here, what are some of our solutions, then?
If jobs is a solution, don't you think, then, that we should be simplifying the business environment of all of these countries?
Don't you think?
And along with you, I would like for all of your friends from the other 50 countries that are on the bottom of that list to do the same thing.
You do that, we do the rest of the job.
I'm doing my part of the game, what are you doing?
(Applause) What are you doing? (Applause) What are you doing?
(Applause) And as for you, everybody here in this room, I leave you with two marching orders.
Get in the game, and the way you get in it is educate yourself, build awareness around yourself, and then also advocate for e-government solutions.
He said, "Oh, corruption, how do we fight corruption?
" Well, as a matter of fact, I'm here to tell you that yes, you can do it by the stroke of a pen.
You do not need anyone to tell you when and how to do that.
It is one thing, actually, that you don't need to wait for anyone to do, so do it.
Otherwise, don't come and tell me that you want to fix corruption.
You and your other 50 friends from the other 50 countries that are at the bottom of that list.
That's how you fight corruption.
If you were only charging me 5 percent to get my stuff in the country, my raw material, instead of the 45 percent, do you really think that I would have to go a pay a bribe?
That's what breeds corruption.
Bad laws, sets of horrible, nonsense laws.
(Applause) (Cheers) Right?
(Applause) You want to fight corruption?
That's what you do.
And again, remember, you don't need to wait for anyone.
You can do that by yourself.
Unless you're telling me that maybe you have no sovereignty, and that's a whole other problem. OK, so, from here on, I have simple words for our "leaders.
" This can go two ways.
It can go the nasty way, because we have hundreds of millions of young people coming to life right now, here, and if they don't have an outlook in life, they are going to go for a revolution.
They're going to go for violence.
And none of us wants that.
None, none of us.
That's the one way it can go.
It happens like that, everybody's happy, we move on with our lives.
It can happen in two ways -- pick violence or you pick the calm, productive way.
I want the calm, productive way.
None of us should ever, ever even try to think about what else could happen if we don't go there.
So, please.
And the time has come.
This type of picture -- prosperity, happiness, human flourishing -- that's what I see if we do our job.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Cheering) Thank you.
(Applause)Today, what I want to share with you is something that happened to me, actually, around four weeks ago, it happened.
Words were said to me that I never thought I would ever hear it said to my face by another human being.
And those words, they shattered my heart.
And at the same time, they filled it with so much hope.
And the whole experience renewed my commitment to the idea that I came to share with you today.
You see, I tell everyone that I am a haunted person.
What haunts me is the impossible stories, story after story after story after story of young people, my people, people like me dying out there on the ocean, right now, laying at the bottom of the ocean, serving as fish food.
Do you really think that's the best we can do?
To serve as fish food?
And for those of them who are trying to migrate to Europe -- because that's what it is all about, they are trying to migrate to Europe to find a job.
Going through Libya.
Do you know what happens to us when we're trying to cross through Libya and we're trapped over there?
Well, we're being sold as slaves.
For 300 dollars, maybe sometimes 500 dollars.
Sometimes I hear stories of bodies that fall off an airplane.
There, I said it.
And that's why I start the businesses that I start, that's usually consumer brands, that have embedded in them the very best of my African culture.
People are poor because they have no money.
You have no money because you have no source of income.
Jobs, thank you.
Where do jobs come from?
Businesses, thank you.
It's like swimming through molasses.
I told you today that someone said to me words that marked me, because I explained the same thing to my employees in Senegal.
It is my environment in which I live, that's my problem.
(Applause) What are you doing? (Applause) What are you doing?
Get in the game, and the way you get in it is educate yourself, build awareness around yourself, and then also advocate for e-government solutions.
" Well, as a matter of fact, I'm here to tell you that yes, you can do it by the stroke of a pen.
You do not need anyone to tell you when and how to do that.
It is one thing, actually, that you don't need to wait for anyone to do, so do it.
(Applause) You want to fight corruption?
As we walked down the streets of Hollywood, in a neighborhood of screenwriters, actors and filmmakers, the trio assumed the invisibility that each senior does.
I would ask myself, "How is it that no one else sees these three human beings?
Why is it that I am the only one who sees them?
" Years later, as I began to share this work with the public, I noticed that people are largely uncomfortable with this story.
Perhaps it is because the trio doesn't assume conventional notions associated with love, romance or partnership.
They were unseen in public and shunned by their peers.
They wanted to belong somewhere but only seemed to belong with each other.
I wanted to belong somewhere, too.
And my camera has been a catalyst for me to belong everywhere.
But beyond challenging sociocultural norms about the elderly, the trio sheds light on fear of remoteness.
At the end of each day, they return to their respective retirement homes.
Under the surface of their aloneness, there is a desire for community, for their people.
There was a sense that they were each yearning for their tribe, but that comfort comes with compromise, because Will cannot commit to one woman.
Sitting with Jeanie one day in her apartment, she said to me, "Sharing Will is a thorn in your side.
A relationship between a man and a woman is private.
It is a couple, not a trio.
" My process is to essentially become the people I document by spending years with them as an observer-occupant, to create a safe space, to then become hidden in plain sight.
I was about 17 when I met the trio, and I shadowed them for four years.
We actually see, in the breakdown of social development, that adolescence and old age look strikingly alike, because both are periods of identity confusion.
I identified with the women.
But also with Will, who made me aware of the divide in me.
The schism that we each often have about what we crave and the actuality of our situation.
Before shooting this series, I was also in love with two different people who knew about each other, being the object over which they fought.
But I also knew what it was like to be at the base of the triangle, like Jeanie or Adina, asking myself, "Why aren't I enough?
" I would look through my viewfinder and see three elderly figures, and it became impossible to deny that regardless of age, we were each in pursuit of filling the proverbial hole through other people.
Perhaps the discomfort of looking at Jeanie, Will and Adina's story is truly a reminder that even at the end of life, we may never reach the fantasy we have envisioned for ourselves.
Thank you for listening.
(Applause)
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine and, just like getting over a cold, you could heal your wounds faster?
Just like vaccines instruct our body to fight disease, we could instead instruct our immune system to build tissues and more quickly heal wounds.
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere might seem like magic, but there are several organisms that can achieve this feat.
Some lizards can regrow their tails, the humble salamander can completely regenerate their arm, and even us mere humans can regrow our liver after losing more than half of its original mass.
To make this magic a bit closer to reality, I'm investigating how our body can heal wounds and build tissue through instructions from the immune system.
From a scrape on your knee to that annoying sinus infection, our immune system defends our body from danger.
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know about our body's defense system, I was able to identify key players in our fight to build back our cuts and bruises.
I discovered a specific type of immune cell, the helper T cell, was present inside that material that I implanted and absolutely critical for wound healing.
Now, just like when you were a kid and you'd break your pencil and try and tape it back together again, we can heal, but it might not be in the most functional way, and we'll get a scar.
So if we don't have these helper T cells, instead of healthy muscle, our muscle develops fat cells inside of it, and if there's fat in our muscle, it isn't as strong.
Now, using our immune system, our body could grow back without these scars and look like what it was before we were even injured.
This ranges from pacemakers to insulin pumps to the materials that engineers are using to try and build new tissue.
So when I place that material, or scaffold, in the body, the immune system creates a small environment of cells and proteins that can change the way that our stem cells behave.
Now, just like the weather affects our daily activities, like going for a run or staying inside and binge-watching an entire TV show on Netflix, the immune environment of a scaffold affects the way that our stem cells grow and develop.
If we have the wrong signals, say the Netflix signals, we get fat cells instead of muscle.
These scaffolds are made of a variety of different things, from plastics to naturally derived materials, nanofibers of varying thicknesses, sponges that are more or less porous, gels of different stiffnesses.
And researchers can even make the materials release different signals over time.
So in other words, we can orchestrate this Broadway show of cells by giving them the correct stage, cues and props that can be changed for different tissues, just like a producer would change the set for "Les Mis" versus "Little Shop of Horrors.
" I'm combining specific types of signals that mimic how our body responds to injury to help us regenerate.
In the future, we could see a scar-proof band-aid, a moldable muscle filler or even a wound-healing vaccine.
Now, we aren't going to wake up tomorrow and be able to heal like Wolverine.
Probably not next Tuesday, either.
But with these advances, and working with our immune system to help build tissue and heal wounds, we could begin seeing products on the market that work with our body's defense system to help us regenerate, and maybe one day be able to keep pace with a salamander.
Thank you.

I'm working to create materials that give us the signals to build new tissue by changing the immune response.
We know that any time a material is implanted in our body, the immune system will respond to it.
This ranges from pacemakers to insulin pumps to the materials that engineers are using to try and build new tissue.
So when I place that material, or scaffold, in the body, the immune system creates a small environment of cells and proteins that can change the way that our stem cells behave.

Is it the intense smell?
And even when you do get treatment, hospitals often make us sicker.
Let me give you two examples.
Four in 10 Japanese medical doctors and five in 10 American medical doctors are burnt out.
In my home country, the Netherlands, only 17 million people live there.
We are short 125,000 nurses over the coming years.
But how did we even end up here, in this idea of placing all kinds of sick people together in one big building?
Well, we have to go back to the Ancient Greeks.
In 400 BC, temples for cure were erected where people could go to get their diagnosis, their treatment and their healing.
Over the last century, we've seen lots of interesting innovations.
We figured out how to make insulin.
We invented pacemakers and X-ray, and we even came into this wonderful new era of cell and gene therapies.
But the biggest change to fix our hospital system altogether is still ahead of us.
And I believe it's time now, we have the opportunity, to revolutionize the system altogether and forget about our current hospital system.
I believe it's time to create a new system that revolves around health care at home.
Recent research has shown that 46 percent of hospital care can move to the patient's home.
That's a lot.
And that's mainly for those patients who suffer from chronic diseases.
With that, hospitals can and should reduce to smaller, agile and mobile care centers focused on acute care. So things like neonatology, intensive care, surgery and imaging will still remain at the hospitals, at least I believe for the foreseeable future.
A few weeks ago, I met a colleague whose mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer, and she said, "Niels, it's hard.
It's so hard when we know that she's got only months to live.
Instead of playing with the grandchildren, she now has to travel three times a week two hours up and down to Amsterdam just to get her treatment and tests.
" And that really breaks my heart, because we all know that a professional nurse could draw her blood at home as well, right?
And if she could get her tests and treatment at home as well, she could do the things that are really important to her in her last months.
And a very practical problem that many patients face when they have to go to a hospital is: Where do I go with my main companion in life, where do I go with my dog?
That's our dog, by the way. Isn't she cute?
(Laughter) But it's not only about convenience.
It's also about unnecessary health care stays and costs.
A friend of mine, Art, he recently needed to be hospitalized for just a minor surgery, and he had to stay in the hospital for over two weeks, just because he needed a specific kind of IV antibiotics.
So he occupied a bed for two weeks that cost over a thousand euros a day.
It's just ridiculous.
And these costs are really at the heart of the issue.
So we've seen over many of our global economies, health care expense grow as a percentage of GDP over the last years.
So here we see that over the last 50 years, health care expense has grown from about five percent in Germany to about 11 percent now.
In the US, we've seen growth from six percent to over 17 percent now.
And a large portion of these costs are driven by investments in large, shiny hospital buildings.
And these buildings are not flexible, and they maintain a system where hospital beds need to be filled for a hospital to run efficiently.
There's no incentive for a hospital to run with less beds.
Just the thought of that makes you sick, right?
And here's the thing: the cost for treating my buddy Art at home can be up to 10 times cheaper than hospital care.
And that is where we're headed.
The hospital bed of the future will be in our own homes.
And it's already starting.
Global home care is growing 10 percent year over year.
And from my own experience, I see that logistics and technology are making these home health care solutions work.
Technology is already allowing us to do things that were once exclusive to hospitals.
Diagnosis tests like blood, glucose tests, urine tests, can now be taken in the comfort of our homes.
And more and more connected devices we see like pacemakers and insulin pumps that will proactively signal if help is needed soon.
And all that technology is coming together in much more insights into the patients' health, and that insight and all of the information leads to better control and to less medical errors -- remember, the third cause of death in the US.
And I see it every day at work.
I work in logistics and for me, home health care works.
So we see a delivery driver deliver the medicine to the patient's home.
A nurse joins him and actually administers the drug at the patient's home.
It's that simple.
Remember my buddy, Art?
He can now get the IV antibiotics in the comfort of his home: no hospital pajamas, no crappy food and no risk of these antibiotic-resistant superbugs that only bite you in these hospitals.
And it goes further.
So now the elderly people can get the treatment that they need in the comfort of their own home while with their best companion in life.
And there's no need anymore to drive hours and hours just to get your treatment and tests.
In the Netherlands and in Denmark, we've seen very good successes in cancer clinics organizing chemotherapies at the patient's homes, sometimes even together with fellow patients.
The best improvements for these patients have been improvements in reduction in stress, anxiety disorders and depression. Home health care also helped them to get back a sense of normality and freedom in their lives, and they've actually helped them to forget about their disease.
But home health care, Niels -- what if I don't even have a home, when I'm homeless, or when I do have a home but there's no one to take care of me or even open up the door?
Well, in comes our sharing economy, or, as I like to call it, the Airbnb for home care.
In the Netherlands, we see churches and care organizations match people in need of care and company with people who actually have a home for them and can provide care and company to them.
Do you?
I'm sure many of you feel the same way, right? But why?
Why is it that we hate hospitals so much?
Or is it just a fact of life we have to live with?
Is it the crappy food?
Is it the expensive parking?
Is it the intense smell?
Or is it the fear of the unknown?
Well, it's all of that, and it's more. Patients often have to travel long distances to get to their nearest hospital, and access to hospital care is becoming more and more an issue in rural areas, in the US, but also in sparsely populated countries like Sweden.
And even when hospitals are more abundant, typically the poor and the elderly have trouble getting care because they lack transportation that is convenient and affordable to them.
And many people are avoiding hospital care altogether, and they miss getting proper treatment due to cost.
We see that 64 percent of Americans are avoiding care due to cost.
And even when you do get treatment, hospitals often make us sicker.
Medical errors are reported to be the third cause of death in the US, just behind cancer and heart disease, the third cause of death.
I'm in health care for over 20 years now, and I witness every day how broken and how obsolete our hospital system is.
Let me give you two examples.
In my home country, the Netherlands, only 17 million people live there.
We are short 125,000 nurses over the coming years.
But how did we even end up here, in this idea of placing all kinds of sick people together in one big building?
Well, we have to go back to the Ancient Greeks.

In the Netherlands, we see churches and care organizations match people in need of care and company with people who actually have a home for them and can provide care and company to them.
And we locked eyes, and although I couldn't speak, she could understand what I was thinking.
Somehow, I was content with this, because I've always tried to do my best in life whenever I can.
" And then I passed out.
It was like a crazy mix of "Westworld" and "Black Mirror.
" But that's a whole other story.
My local TV station reported live from outside the hospital of a Cambridge scientist who was in a coma, and they didn't know if she would live or die or walk or talk.
And a week later, I woke up from that coma.
And that was the first gift.
Then I had the gift to think, the gift to move, the gift to breathe and the gift to eat and to drink.
That took three and a half months.
But there was one thing that I never got back, though, and that was my privacy.
The tabloid press made the story about gender.
Look -- I'm transgender, it's not that big a deal.
Like, my hair color or my shoe size is way more interesting.
When I last spoke here -- (Applause) When I last spoke here -- (Applause) at TED, I didn't talk about it, because it's boring.
And one Scottish newspaper ran with the headline: "Sex Swap Scientist Gored by Stag. " And five others did similar things.
And for a minute, I was angry.
But then I found my calm place.
And what ran through my head was, "They've crossed the wrong woman, and they're not going to know what's hit them.
" (Laughter) I'm a kindness ninja.
I don't really know what a ninja does, but to me, they slip through the shadows, crawl through the sewers, skip across the rooftops, and before you know it, they're behind you.
They don't turn up with an army or complain, and they're laser-focused on a plan.
So when I lay in my hospital bed, I thought of my plan to help reduce the chances of them doing this to somebody else, by using the system as is, and paying the price of sacrificing my privacy.
What they told one million people, I will tell 10 million people.
Because when you're angry, people defend themselves.
So I didn't attack them, and they were defenseless.
I wrote kind and calm letters to these newspapers.
And The Sun newspaper, the kind of "Fox News" of the UK, thanked me for my "reasoned approach.
" I asked for no apology, no retraction, no money, just an acknowledgment that they broke their own rules, and what they did was just wrong.
And on this journey, I started to learn who they are, and they began to learn who I am.
And we actually became friends.
I've even had a few glasses of wine with Philippa from The Sun since then.
And after three months, they all agreed, and the statements were published on a Friday, and that was the end of that.
Or so they thought.
On the Saturday, I went on the evening news, with the headline "Six National Newspapers Admit They Were Wrong.
" And the anchor said to me, "But don't you think it's our job as journalists to sensationalize a story?
" And I said, "I was laying on a forest floor, gored by a stag.
Is that not sensational enough?
" (Laughter) And I was now writing the headlines.
My favorite one was, "The stag trampled on my throat, and the press trampled on my privacy.
" It was the most read piece of BBC News online that day.
And I was kind of having fun.
And by the end of my week of media, I started to use my newfound voice and platform to spread a message of love and kindness.
And when I had the minute of anger and hatred towards those press and journalists, I had to identify my inner bigotry towards them.
And I had to meet and speak with these people without judgment.
I had to let myself understand them, and in return, they began to understand me.
Well, six months later, they asked me to join the committee that regulates the press.
And a few times a year, I sip tea and dip biscuits with the likes of Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, who says to me, "So, Kate, how have your last few months been? " And I respect them.
And I'm now one of three members of the public who has a seat at the table -- not because I'm different, but because my voice counts, just like anybody else.
And the irony is, every now and again, I'm asked to visit those printing presses of this declining industry, because some people think that the technology I spoke about here, last time at TED, my interactive print, might actually help save them.
So beware of your inner bigot, and make friends from your enemies.
Thank you.
(Applause)
If there's one city in the world where it's hard to find a place to buy or rent, it's Sydney.
And if you've tried to find a home here recently, you're familiar with the problem.
Every time you walk into an open house, you get some information about what's out there and what's on the market, but every time you walk out, you're running the risk of the very best place passing you by.
So how do you know when to switch from looking to being ready to make an offer?
This is such a cruel and familiar problem that it might come as a surprise that it has a simple solution.
37 percent.
(Laughter) If you want to maximize the probability that you find the very best place, you should look at 37 percent of what's on the market, and then make an offer on the next place you see, which is better than anything that you've seen so far.
Or if you're looking for a month, take 37 percent of that time -- 11 days, to set a standard -- and then you're ready to act.
We know this because trying to find a place to live is an example of an optimal stopping problem.
A class of problems that has been studied extensively by mathematicians and computer scientists.
I'm a computational cognitive scientist.
I spend my time trying to understand how it is that human minds work, from our amazing successes to our dismal failures.
To do that, I think about the computational structure of the problems that arise in everyday life, and compare the ideal solutions to those problems to the way that we actually behave.
As a side effect, I get to see how applying a little bit of computer science can make human decision-making easier.
I have a personal motivation for this.
(Laughter) She pointed out that I was taking the wrong approach to solving this problem -- and she later became my wife.
(Laughter) (Applause) Whether it's as basic as trying to decide what restaurant to go to or as important as trying to decide who to spend the rest of your life with, human lives are filled with computational problems that are just too hard to solve by applying sheer effort.
For those problems, it's worth consulting the experts: computer scientists.
(Laughter) When you're looking for life advice, computer scientists probably aren't the first people you think to talk to.
Living life like a computer -- stereotypically deterministic, exhaustive and exact -- doesn't sound like a lot of fun.
But thinking about the computer science of human decisions reveals that in fact, we've got this backwards.
When applied to the sorts of difficult problems that arise in human lives, the way that computers actually solve those problems looks a lot more like the way that people really act.
Take the example of trying to decide what restaurant to go to. This is a problem that has a particular computational structure.
Over the last 60 years, computer scientists have made a lot of progress understanding the explore/exploit trade-off, and their results offer some surprising insights.
When you're trying to decide what restaurant to go to, the first question you should ask yourself is how much longer you're going to be in town.
If you're just going to be there for a short time, then you should exploit. There's no point gathering information.
Just go to a place you already know is good.
But if you're going to be there for a longer time, explore.
Try something new, because the information you get is something that can improve your choices in the future.
The value of information increases the more opportunities you're going to have to use it.
This principle can give us insight into the structure of a human life as well.
Babies don't have a reputation for being particularly rational.
They're always trying new things, and you know, trying to stick them in their mouths.
But in fact, this is exactly what they should be doing.
They're in the explore phase of their lives, and some of those things could turn out to be delicious.
At the other end of the spectrum, the old guy who always goes to the same restaurant and always eats the same thing isn't boring -- he's optimal. (Laughter) He's exploiting the knowledge that he's earned through a lifetime's experience.
More generally, knowing about the explore/exploit trade-off can make it a little easier for you to sort of relax and go easier on yourself when you're trying to make a decision.
You don't have to go to the best restaurant every night. Take a chance, try something new, explore.
You might learn something. And the information that you gain is going to be worth more than one pretty good dinner. Computer science can also help to make it easier on us in other places at home and in the office.
If you've ever had to tidy up your wardrobe, you've run into a particularly agonizing decision: you have to decide what things you're going to keep and what things you're going to give away.
Martha Stewart turns out to have thought very hard about this -- (Laughter) and she has some good advice.
She says, "Ask yourself four questions: How long have I had it?
Does it still function?
Is it a duplicate of something that I already own?
And when was the last time I wore it or used it?
" But there's another group of experts who perhaps thought even harder about this problem, and they would say one of these questions is more important than the others.
Those experts?
The people who design the memory systems of computers.
Most computers have two kinds of memory systems: a fast memory system, like a set of memory chips that has limited capacity, because those chips are expensive, and a slow memory system, which is much larger.
In order for the computer to operate as efficiently as possible, you want to make sure that the pieces of information you want to access are in the fast memory system, so that you can get to them quickly.
Each time you access a piece of information, it's loaded into the fast memory and the computer has to decide which item it has to remove from that memory, because it has limited capacity.
Over the years, computer scientists have tried a few different strategies for deciding what to remove from the fast memory. They've tried things like choosing something at random or applying what's called the "first-in, first-out principle," which means removing the item which has been in the memory for the longest.
But the strategy that's most effective focuses on the items which have been least recently used.
This says if you're going to decide to remove something from memory, you should take out the thing which was last accessed the furthest in the past.
And there's a certain kind of logic to this.
Recognizing that, maybe it's worth applying the least recently used principle to organizing your wardrobe as well.
So if we go back to Martha's four questions, the computer scientists would say that of these, the last one is the most important.
This idea of organizing things so that the things you are most likely to need are most accessible can also be applied in your office.
The Japanese economist Yukio Noguchi actually invented a filing system that has exactly this property.
He started with a cardboard box, and he put his documents into the box from the left-hand side.
Each time he'd add a document, he'd move what was in there along and he'd add that document to the left-hand side of the box.
And each time he accessed a document, he'd take it out, consult it and put it back in on the left-hand side.
As a result, the documents would be ordered from left to right by how recently they had been used.
And he found he could quickly find what he was looking for by starting at the left-hand side of the box and working his way to the right.
Before you dash home and implement this filing system -- (Laughter) it's worth recognizing that you probably already have.
Organizing your wardrobe or your desk are probably not the most pressing problems in your life.
Sometimes the problems we have to solve are simply very, very hard.
But even in those cases, computer science can offer some strategies and perhaps some solace.
The best algorithms are about doing what makes the most sense in the least amount of time.
When computers face hard problems, they deal with them by making them into simpler problems -- by making use of randomness, by removing constraints or by allowing approximations.
Solving those simpler problems can give you insight into the harder problems, and sometimes produces pretty good solutions in their own right.
Knowing all of this has helped me to relax when I have to make decisions.
You could take the 37 percent rule for finding a home as an example.
There's no way that you can consider all of the options, so you have to take a chance.
And even if you follow the optimal strategy, you're not guaranteed a perfect outcome.
If you follow the 37 percent rule, the probability that you find the very best place is -- funnily enough . . . (Laughter) 37 percent.
You fail most of the time.
But that's the best that you can do.
Ultimately, computer science can help to make us more forgiving of our own limitations.
You can't control outcomes, just processes.
And as long as you've used the best process, you've done the best that you can.
Sometimes those best processes involve taking a chance -- not considering all of your options, or being willing to settle for a pretty good solution.
These aren't the concessions that we make when we can't be rational -- they're what being rational means.
Thank you.
I come from Egypt, which is also called Umm al-Dunya, the Mother of the World. It's a rich country filled with stories of rebellion, stories of civilizational triumph and downfall and the rich, religious, ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity.
Growing up in such an environment, I became a strong believer in the power of storytelling. As I searched for the medium with which to tell my story, I stumbled upon graphic design.
I would like to share with you a project of how graphic design can bring the Arabic language to life.
But first, let me tell you why I want to do this. I believe that graphic design can change the world.
At least in my very own city of Cairo, it helped overthrow two separate dictators. As you can see from those photos, the power and potential of graphic design as a tool for positive change is undeniably strong.
Egypt's 2011 revolution was also a grassroots design revolution. Everyone became a creator.
People were the real designers and, just overnight, Cairo was flooded with posters, signage, graffiti.
Visual communication was the medium that spoke far louder than words when the population of over 90 million voices were suppressed for almost 30 years.
It was precisely this political and social suppression, coupled with decades of colonialism and miseducation that slowly eroded the significance of the Arabic script in the region.
All of these countries once used Arabic.
Now it's just the green and the blue.
To put it simply, the Arabic script is dying.
In postcolonial Arab countries functioning in an increasingly globalized world, it is a growing alarm that less and less people are using the Arabic script to communicate. As I was studying my master's in Italy, I noticed myself missing Arabic.
I missed looking at the letters, digesting their meaning. So one day, I walked into one of the biggest libraries in Italy in search of an Arabic book.
I was surprised to find that this is what they had under the category of "Arabic/Middle Eastern books. " (Laughter) Fear, terrorism and destruction.
One word: ISIS.
My heart ached that this is how we are portrayed to the world, even from a literary perspective.
The cultural products of an entire region of the world have been barred from imparting any kind of real impact on global media productions and contemporary social discourse.
And then I reminded myself of my number one belief: design can change the world.
All you need is for someone to catch a glimpse of your work, feel, connect.
And so I started.
I thought about how can I stop the world from seeing us as evil, as terrorists of this planet, and start perceiving us as equals, fellow humans?
How can I save and honor the Arabic script and share it with other people, other cultures? And then it hit me: What if I combined the two most significant symbols of innocence and Arab identity?
Maybe then people could resonate.
What's more pure, innocent and fun as LEGO? It's a universal child's toy.
You play with them, you build with them, and with them, you imagine endless possibilities.
My eureka moment was to find a bilingual solution for Arabic education, because effective communication and education is the road to more tolerant communities.
However, the Arabic and Latin scripts do not only represent different worlds but also create technical difficulties for both Eastern and Western communities on a daily basis.
There are so many reasons why Arabic and Latin are different, but here are some of the main ones.
Yes, both use upward and downward strokes, but have completely different baselines.
Arabic tends to be more calligraphic and connectivity is important to the Arabic language, whose letters have to be mostly joined in order to articulate a given word. It also uses an entirely different system of punctuation and diacritics.
But most importantly, Arabic has no capital letters.
Instead it has four different letter forms: initial, medial, isolated and final.
I want to introduce the Arabic language to young learners, foreign speakers, but most importantly help refugees integrate to their host societies through creating a bilingual learning system, a two-way flow of communication.
And I called it "Let's Play.
" The idea is to simply create a fun and engaging way of learning Modern Standard Arabic through LEGO.
These are the two words. "Let's Play. " Every colored bar marks an Arabic letter.
As you can see, the letter is explained in form, sound and examples of words in function, in addition to the equivalent in Latin.
Together, they form a fun pocket book with the 29 Arabic letters and the four different forms, plus a 400-word dictionary.
So this is how the page looks like.
You have the letter, the transliteration in Latin and the description underneath.
I'll take you through the process.
So first in my tiny studio in Florence, I built the letters. I photographed each letter separately, and then I retouched every letter and chose the correct color background and typefaces to use.
Ultimately, I created the full letter set, which is 29 letters times four different forms. That's 116 letters build just in one week.
I believe that information should and can be fun, portable.
This book is the final product, which I would eventually like to publish and translate into as many languages in the world, so that Arabic teaching and learning becomes fun, easy and accessible globally.
With this book, I hope to save my nation's beautiful script. (Applause) Thank you.
Working on this project was a form of visual meditation, like a Sufi dance, a prayer to a better planet.
One set of building blocks made two languages. LEGO is just a metaphor.
It's because we are all made of the same building unit, is that I can see a future where the barriers between people all come tumbling down.
So no matter how ugly the world around us gets, or how many discouraging books on ISIS, the terrorist group, and not Isis, the ancient Egyptian goddess, continue to be published, I will keep building one colorful world.
Shukran, which means "thank you.
" (Applause) Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
You spend weeks studying for an important test.
On the big day, you wait nervously as your teacher hands it out.
You’re working your way through, when you’re asked to define ‘ataraxia.
’ You know you’ve seen it before, but your mind goes blank.
What just happened?
The answer lies in the complex relationship between stress and memory.
There are many types and degrees of stress and different kinds of memory, but we’re going to focus on how short-term stress impacts your memory for facts.
To start, it helps to understand how this kind of memory works.
Facts you read, hear, or study become memories through a process with three main steps.
First comes acquisition: the moment you encounter a new piece of information.
Each sensory experience activates a unique set of brain areas.
In order to become lasting memories, these sensory experiences have to be consolidated by the hippocampus, influenced by the amygdala, which emphasizes experiences associated with strong emotions.
The hippocampus then encodes memories, probably by strengthening the synaptic connections stimulated during the original sensory experience.
Once a memory has been encoded, it can be remembered, or retrieved, later.
Memories are stored all over the brain, and it’s likely the prefrontal cortex that signals for their retrieval.
So how does stress affect each of these stages?
But even though some stress can be helpful, extreme and chronic stress can have the opposite effect.
Researchers have tested this by injecting rats directly with stress hormones.
As they gradually increased the dose of corticosteroids, the rats’ performance on memory tests increased at first, but dropped off at higher doses.
In humans, we see a similar positive effect with moderate stress.
But that only appears when the stress is related to the memory task— so while time pressure might help you memorize a list, having a friend scare you will not.
And the weeks, months, or even years of sustained corticosteroids that result from chronic stress can damage the hippocampus and decrease your ability to form new memories.
It would be nice if some stress also helped us remember facts, but unfortunately, the opposite is true.
The act of remembering relies on the prefrontal cortex, which governs thought, attention, and reasoning.
When corticosteroids stimulate the amygdala, the amygdala inhibits, or lessens the activity of, the prefrontal cortex.
The reason for this inhibition is so the fight/flight/freeze response can overrule slower, more reasoned thought in a dangerous situation.
But that can also have the unfortunate effect of making your mind go blank during a test.
And then the act of trying to remember can itself be a stressor, leading to a vicious cycle of more corticosteroid release and an even smaller chance of remembering.
So what can you do to turn stress to your advantage and stay calm and collected when it matters the most?
First, if you know a stressful situation like a test is coming, try preparing in conditions similar to the stressful environment.
Novelty can be a stressor.
Completing practice questions under time pressure, or seated at a desk rather than on a couch, can make your stress response to these circumstances less sensitive during the test itself.
Exercise is another useful tool.
Increasing your heart and breathing rate is linked to chemical changes in your brain that help reduce anxiety and increase your sense of well-being.
Regular exercise is also widely thought to improve sleeping patterns, which comes in handy the night before a test.
And on the actual test day, try taking deep breaths to counteract your body’s flight/fight/freeze response.
Deep breathing exercises have shown measurable reduction in test anxiety in groups ranging from third graders to nursing students.
So the next time you find your mind going blank at a critical moment, take a few deep breaths until you remember ataraxia: a state of calmness, free from anxiety.
When is seeing not believing?
A couple years ago, my friend sent me this photo from Ürümqi, which is the capital of Xinjiang province in northwest China.
On this particular day, she couldn't believe her eyes.
Checking the quality of the air outside using this app on her iPad, the numbers were telling her the air quality was good, one on a scale of 500. But when she looked outside, she saw something much different.
Yes, those are buildings in the background.
(Laughter) But the data were simply not telling the truth of what people were seeing and breathing, and it's because they were failing to measure PM2.5, or fine particulate pollution.
Now, this questioning has led to an environmental awakening of sorts in China, forcing China's government to tackle its pollution problems.
Now China has the opportunity to become a global environmental leader.
But the picture that I'll paint for you today is one that's mixed.
There are some signs that are very promising, and there are other trends that are more troubling that warrant closer attention.
But now let's go back to the story at hand.
They have environmental policies?
What policies?
At that time, PM2.5 data was considered too politically sensitive and so the government was keeping it secret, but citizens were becoming aware of its harmful human health effects, and they were demanding greater transparency on the part of the government.
I actually started to see some of this growing evolution and awareness myself cropping up all over China. Department stores, for example, started to market these air purifiers that could filter out harmful PM2.5. Citizens were also adopting PM2.5 as the title of musical festivals.
(Laughter) And then I went to a golf course in Shenzhen, which is in southern China, and you can see from this banner, they're advertising a retreat from PM2.5. Golf sub-par, but don't breathe sub-par air.
And then Shanghai's Environmental Protection Bureau decided to create a mascot named after the air quality index to better communicate the air quality data to its people.
And then in 2015, former CCTV reporter Chai Jing created this documentary called "Under the Dome.
" It would be likened to Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring.
" And much like Rachel Carson brought to attention the fact that pesticides were harming human health, "Under the Dome" stamped into the popular consciousness that air pollution was leading to one million premature deaths every year in China alone.
This video garnered more than a hundred million views in a single weekend before China's government, fearing that it might incite some type of social unrest, pulled it from the internet.
But the damage had already been done.
Public outcry over air pollution galvanized China's government, perhaps in an act of self-preservation, to think big and decisively about how it could tackle the root of its air pollution and many of its other environmental problems: its energy system.
For you see, in China, about two thirds of its electricity comes from coal.
They've also been making enormous investments when it comes to clean and renewable energy, like hydropower, wind and solar, and the pace and the scale of this transformation has been absolutely mind-blowing.
Let me give you a couple of statistics to show you what I mean.
China leads the world when it comes to hydropower, with a third of total capacity.
There's enough for every Chinese citizen to power two homes in a single year from hydropower alone.
You may have heard of the Three Gorges Dam, pictured here, which is the largest power station in the world, and it's powered by water.
In terms of wind power, China has a third of the global capacity.
This makes it the number one leader by far.
When we look at solar, China's also leading.
In fact, they crushed their 2020 target of installing 105 gigawatts of solar power.
This is after the government already revised upwards several times its solar energy target between 2009 and 2015. Last year, in seven months alone, China was able to install a whopping 35 gigawatts of solar power.
This is more than half of what the US has combined in total and China did this in just seven months alone.
We can verify this remarkable growth in solar power from space, like the startup SpaceKnow has done in this slide.
By 2020, China is on track to generate Germany's entire electricity consumption from just wind and solar power alone.
It's pretty darn remarkable.
And we see some evidence now that China's efforts on clean energy is actually having an effect, not just on air pollution reduction, but also on global climate change, where China has the world's largest carbon footprint.
If we look at some of the data, we can see that China's coal consumption may have already reached a peak as early as 2013. This is a major reason why China's government announced that actually they've already achieved their 2020 carbon reduction pledge ahead of schedule.
This reduction in coal consumption is also directly driving improvements in air quality across the country, as I've shown here in blue.
In most major Chinese cities, air pollution has fallen by as much as 30 percent.
And this reduction in air pollution is actually leading people to live longer lives in China, on average two and a half years more than they would have in 2013. In yellow, we can see the cities that have experienced the greatest improvements in air quality.
But of course, as I mentioned at the beginning of this talk, we have to temper some of this optimism with a healthy dose of caution, and that's largely because the data are still being determined.
But of course, the statistics and the data are still murky and that's because China regularly revises its coal statistics after the fact.
Actually, it's funny, since I've been here I've been having a debate on Twitter with other climate modelers, trying to figure out whether China's carbon emissions have gone up, gone down or whether they're staying relatively stable.
And of course, China is still a rapidly developing country.
It's still experimenting with a range of policies, like dockless bike sharing, which has been hailed as a possible sustainable transport solution.
But then we have images of this bicycle graveyard that tell a more cautionary tale.
Sometimes, solutions can move too fast and outpace demand.
And of course, coal is still king in China, at least for now.
So why should we care about what China is doing on the environment?
Well, what China does at home on the environment can have global implications for the rest of us.
To borrow a line from Chai Jing, we're all under the same dome, and air pollution that originates in China can travel beyond its borders and affect populations as far away as those in North America.
China's not only exporting air pollution, but they're also exporting aid, infrastructure, technology abroad.
President Xi Jinping in 2013 announced the One Belt, One Road Initiative, a massive, one-trillion-US-dollar infrastructure investment project in more than 60 other countries.
And historically, when we've seen that China has made these infrastructure investments abroad, they haven't always been clean.
The Global Environment Institute, a Chinese civil society group, found that in the last 15 years, China has invested in more than 240 coal-fired power plants in more than 68 countries affiliated with the One Belt, One Road Initiative.
That's more than a quarter of China's own domestic coal-fired capacity that is exported abroad.
So we can see that even though China is cleaning up at home, it's exporting some of that pollution to other countries, and greenhouse gas emissions simply don't have a passport.
So when we're trying to evaluate this question of whether or not China is actually leading, we can see it's still very much an open debate.
But time is running out.
I've studied the climate models, and the outlook is not good.
We still have a gap between current policies and what needs to happen if we want to avoid dangerous climate change.
Leadership is what we desperately need, but it's not coming from the US, for example.
The US administration last June announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, so now people are looking towards China to fill that leadership void.
So China is very much in the driver's seat determining our global environmental future. What they do on carbon trading, on clean energy, on air pollution, we can learn many lessons.
One of those lessons is that clean energy is not just good for the environment, it can save lives by reducing air pollution.
It's also good for the economy.
We can see that last year, China was responsible for 30 percent of the global growth in green jobs. The US?
Only six. So the picture that I just painted for you hopefully seems much different from those murky, foggy air quality statistics to a much clearer picture of China's clean energy.
And even though China is headed in the right direction, we know that there's still a very long road ahead. So let me ask you once more: Is seeing believing?
Can we trust the data and the statistics that show that China's air quality is coming down and that its war on coal is actually having an effect?
Well, let's take a look at some of the latest satellite images of China's solar power installations.
I want you to look very closely at this image.
Can you see?
The proof may just be in the pandas.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)When is seeing not believing?
A couple years ago, my friend sent me this photo from Ürümqi, which is the capital of Xinjiang province in northwest China.

And then Shanghai's Environmental Protection Bureau decided to create a mascot named after the air quality index to better communicate the air quality data to its people.
I call her AQI Girl, and her expression and hair color changes depending on the quality of air outside.
Five years later and she's still the mostly smiling face of Shanghai's air quality.
" It would be likened to Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring.

Things are about to get more mysterious.
" (Laughs) (Cheers) (Applause) We will not be visiting this galaxy anytime soon.
Well, actually, this is one of the nearby galaxies.
I study this object in different light -- in ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared.
Small details on our body, like a scar or wrinkles, tell the story of our lives.
Similarly, a galaxy's structure in different light can help us trace back their origin and evolution.
How do I look for these details?
I model the bright central body and remove my model from the image to check for any hidden features, because a bright structure in a galaxy may blind our views of faint features, just like using sunglasses when you are blinded by the intense light.
The result was a big surprise.
This galaxy doesn't just have an outer ring, it has an additional, diffused inner ring.
We were having a hard time explaining the origin of the outer ring in Hoag-type galaxies.
Now we also need to explain this mysterious second ring.
There is currently no known mechanism that can explain the existence of an inner ring in such a peculiar galaxy.
So the discovery of Burçin's Galaxy clearly highlights the gap in our knowledge of galaxy evolution.
Further research into how this extremely rare galaxy was formed can provide us with new clues on how the universe works.
This discovery tells us that we still have a lot to learn, and we should keep looking deeper and deeper in space and keep searching for the unknown.
Thank you.
(Applause)There are more than a trillion galaxies in the universe.
And my team discovered an extremely rare one, a galaxy that doesn't look quite like anything observed before.
This galaxy is so peculiar, that it challenges our theories and our assumptions about how the universe works.
The majority of the galaxies are spiral, similar to our own Milky Way.
We have strong theories about how these common galaxies form and evolve.
But we don't understand how rare galaxies form and evolve.
An especially puzzling rare case is Hoag's Object.
It has a very symmetric central body surrounded by a circular outer ring, with nothing visible connecting them.
Hoag-type galaxies are among the rarest types of galaxies currently known.
There are fewer than one in 1,000 galaxies.
It's a mystery how the stars in the outer ring are just floating there in such an orderly manner.
That's interesting, right? Hold on.
Things are about to get more mysterious.
The galaxy that my team discovered is even rarer and much more complex than that.
You know, sometimes, you search and search for these objects, and you find nothing.
But sometimes, it just appears in the background, when you are not even looking for it.
This system looks very similar to Hoag's Object, with its central body and circular outer ring.
We got very excited and thought we discovered another Hoag's Object.
But my research showed this is an entirely new galaxy type, now commonly referred to as "Burçin's Galaxy.
" (Laughs) (Cheers) (Applause) We will not be visiting this galaxy anytime soon.
It is approximately 359 million light years away from Earth.
You may think this is far.
This galaxy doesn't just have an outer ring, it has an additional, diffused inner ring.
In premodern Italy, failed business owners, who had outstanding debts, were taken totally naked to the public square where they had to bang their butts against a special stone while a crowd jeered at them.
In fact, we worked for years without a salary, hoping that a miracle would happen, that magically a great buyer would arrive and she would make the business profitable.
But that miracle never happened.
In the end, we had to close the business, and that broke my heart.
I started everything to create a positive impact on the life of the artisans.
And I felt that I have done the opposite.
I felt so guilty that I decided to hide this failure from my conversations and my resume for years.
I didn't know other failed entrepreneurs, and I thought I was the only loser in the world.
One night, seven years later, I was out with some friends and we were talking about the life of the entrepreneur.
And of course, the issue of failure came out.
I decided to confess to my friends the story of my failed business. And they shared similar stories.
In that moment, a thought became really clear in my mind: all of my friends were failures.
(Laughter) Being more serious, that night I realized that A: I wasn't the only loser in the world, and B: we all have hidden failures.
Please tell me if that is not true.
That night was like an exorcism for me.
I realized that sharing your failures makes you stronger, not weaker.
And being open to my vulnerability helped me connect with others in a deeper and more meaningful way and embrace life lessons I wouldn't have learned previously.
As a consequence of this experience of sharing stories of businesses that didn't work, we decided to create a platform of events to help others share their failure stories.
And we called it Fuckup Nights.
Years later, we also created a research center devoted to the story of failure and its implications on business, people and society and as we love cool names, we called it the Failure Institute.
It has been surprising to see that when an entrepreneur stands on a stage and shares a story of failure, she can actually enjoy that experience.
It doesn't have to be a moment of shame and embarrassment, as it used to be in the past.
It is an opportunity to share lessons learned and build empathy.
We have also discovered that when the members of a team share their failures, magic happens.
Bonds grow stronger and collaboration becomes easier.
Through our events and research projects, we have found some interesting facts.
For instance, that men and women react in a different way after the failure of a business.
The most common reaction among men is to start a new business within one year of failure, but in a different sector, while women decide to look for a job and postpone the creation of a new business.
Our hypothesis is that this happens because women tend to suffer more from the impostor syndrome.
We feel that we need something else to be a good entrepreneur.
But I have seen that in many, many cases women have everything that's needed.
We just need to take the step.
And in the case of men, it is more common to see that they feel they have enough knowledge and just need to put it in practice in another place with better luck.
Another interesting finding has been that there are regional differences on how entrepreneurs cope with failure.
For instance, the most common reaction after the failure of a business in the American continent is to go back to school.
While in Europe, the most common reaction is to look for a therapist.
(Laughter) We're not sure which is a better reaction after the failure of a business, but this is something we will study in the future.
Another interesting finding has been the profound impact that public policy has on failed entrepreneurs.
For instance, in my country, in Mexico, the regulatory environment is so hard, that closing a business can take you a lot of time and a lot of money.
Let's begin with the money.
In the best possible scenario, meaning you don't have problems with partners, providers, clients, employees, in the best possible scenario, officially closing a business will cost you 2,000 dollars. Which is a lot of money in Mexico.
Someone who earns the minimum wage would have to work for 15 months to save this amount.
Now, let's talk about the time. As you may know, in most of the developing world, the average life expectancy of a business is two years.
In Mexico, the process of officially closing a business takes two years.
What happens when the average life expectancy of a business is so similar to the time it will take you to close it if it doesn't work?
Of course, this discourages business creation and promotes informal economy.
In fact, econometric research has proved that if the process of declaring bankruptcy takes less time and less money, more new firms will enter the market.
For this reason, in 2017, we proposed a series of public policy recommendations for the procedure of officially closing businesses in Mexico.
For a whole year, we worked with entrepreneurs from all over the country and with Congress.
And the good news is that we managed to help change the law.
Yay!
(Applause) The idea is that when the new regulation comes into force, entrepreneurs will be able to close their businesses in an online procedure that is faster and inexpensive.
(Sighs) On the night we invented Fuckup Nights, we never imagined that the movement would grow this big.
We are in 80 countries now.
In that moment, our only intention was to put the topic of failure on the table.
To help our friends see that failure is something we must talk about.
It is not a cause of humiliation, as it used to be in the past, or a cause of celebration, as some people say.
In fact, I want to confess something.
Every time I listen to Silicon Valley types or students bragging about failing fast and often like it's no big deal, I cringe.
Because I think that there is a dark side on the mantra "fail fast.
" Of course, failing fast is a great way to accelerate learning and avoid wasting time.
But I fear that when we present rapid failure to entrepreneurs as their one and only option, we might be promoting laziness.
We might be promoting that entrepreneurs give up too easily.
I also fear that the culture of rapid failure could be minimizing the devastating consequences of the failure of a business.
For instance, when my social enterprise died, the worst part was that I had to go back to the indigenous community and tell the women that the business had failed and it was my fault.
For some people this could be seen like a great learning opportunity for me, but the truth is that the closure of this business represented much more than that.
It meant that the women would stop receiving an income that they really needed.
For this reason, I want to propose something.
I want to propose that just as we put aside the idea of publicly humiliating failed entrepreneurs, we must put aside the idea that failing fast is always the best.
And I want to propose a new mantra: fail mindfully.
We must remember that businesses are made of people, businesses are not entities that appear and disappear magically without consequences.
When a firm dies, some people will lose their jobs.
And others will lose their money.
And in the case of social and green enterprises, the death of this business can have a negative impact on the ecosystems or communities they were trying to serve.
But what does it mean to fail mindfully?
It means being aware of the impact, of the consequences of the failure of that business.
Being aware of the lessons learned.
And being aware of the responsibility to share those learnings with the world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm here to tell you not just my story but stories of exceptional women from India whom I've met.
They continue to inspire me, teach me, guide me in my journey of my life.
These are incredible women.
They never had an opportunity to go to school, they had no degrees, no travel, no exposure.
Ordinary women who did extraordinary things with the greatest of their courage, wisdom and humility.
These are my teachers.
For the last three decades, I've been working, staying and living in India and working with women in rural India.
I was born and brought up in Mumbai.
When I was in college, I met Jayaprakash Narayan, famous Gandhian leader who inspired youth to work in rural India.
I went into the villages to work in rural India.
I was part of land rights movement, farmers' movement and women's movement.
On the same line, I ended up in a very small village, fell in love with a young, handsome, dynamic young farmer-leader who was not very educated, but he could pull the crowd.
And so in the passion of youth, I married him and left Mumbai, and went to a small village which did not have running water and no toilet.
Honestly, my family and friends were horrified.
(Laughter) I was staying with my family, with my three children in the village, and one day, a few years later one day, a woman called Kantabai came to me.
Kantabai said, "I want to open a saving account.
I want to save.
" I asked Kantabai: "You are doing business of blacksmith.
Do you have enough money to save?
You are staying on the street.
Can you save?
" Kantabai was insistent.
" I went with Kantabai to the bank.
Kantabai wanted to save 10 rupees a day -- less than 15 cents.
Bank manager refused to open the account of Kantabai.
He said Kantabai's amount is too small and it's not worth his time.
Kantabai was not asking any loan from the bank.
She was not asking any subsidy or grant from the government.
What she was asking was to have a safe place to save her hard-earned money.
And that was her right.
And I went -- I said if banks are not opening the account of Kantabai, why not start the bank which will give an opportunity for women like Kantabai to save? And I applied for the banking license to Reserve Bank of India.
(Applause) No, it was not an easy task.
Our license was rejected -- (Laughter) on the grounds -- Reserve Bank said that we cannot issue a license to the bank whose promoting members who are nonliterate.
I was terrified.
I was crying.
And by coming back home, I was continuously crying.
I told Kantabai and other women that we couldn't get the license because our women are nonliterate.
Our women said, "Stop crying.
We will learn to read and write and apply again, so what?
" (Applause) We started our literacy classes.
Every day our women would come.
They were so determined that after working the whole day, they would come to the class and learn to read and write.
After five months, we applied again, but this time I didn't go alone.
Fifteen women accompanied me to Reserve Bank of India.
Our women told the officer of Reserve Bank, "You rejected the license because we cannot read and write.
You rejected the license because we are nonliterate.
" But they said, "There were no schools when we were growing, so we are not responsible for our noneducation.
" And they said, "We cannot read and write, but we can count.
" (Laughter) (Applause) And they challenged the officer.
"Then tell us to calculate the interest of any principal amount.
" (Laughter) "If we are unable to do it, don't give us license.
Tell your officers to do it without a calculator and see who can calculate faster.
" (Applause) Needless to say, we got the banking license.
(Laughter) (Applause) Today, more than 100,000 women are banking with us and we have more than 20 million dollars of capital.
This is all women's savings, women capital, no outside investors asking for a business plan. No. It's our own rural women's savings.
(Applause) I also want to say that yes, after we got the license, today Kantabai has her own house and is staying with her family in her own house for herself and her family.
(Applause) When we started our banking operations, I could see that our women were not able to come to the bank because they used to lose the working day.
I thought if women are not coming to the bank, bank will go to them, and we started doorstep banking.
Recently, we starting digital banking.
Digital banking required to remember a PIN number.
Our women said, "We don't want a PIN number.
That's not a good idea.
" And we tried to explain to them that maybe you should remember the PIN number; we will help you to remember the PIN number.
They were firm.
They said, "suggest something else," and they -- (Laughter) and they said, "What about thumb?
" I thought that's a great idea.
We'll link that digital banking with biometric, and now women use the digital financial transaction by using the thumb.
And you know what they said?
They said, "Anybody can steal my PIN number and take away my hard-earned money, but nobody can steal my thumb.
" (Applause) That reinforced the teaching which I have always learned from women: never provide poor solutions to poor people.
They are smart.
(Applause) A few months later, another woman came to the bank -- Kerabai.
She mortgaged her gold and took the loan. I asked Kerabai, "Why are you mortgaging your precious jewelry and taking a loan?
" Kerabai said, "Don't you realize that it's a terrible drought?
There's no food or fodder for the animals.
No water.
I'm mortgaging gold to buy food and fodder for my animals.
" And then she asks me, "Can I mortgage gold and get water?
" I had no answer.
Kerabai challenged me: "You're working in the village with women and finance, but what if one day there's no water?
If you leave this village, with whom are you going to do banking?
" Kerabai had a valid question, so in this drought, we decided to start the cattle camp in the area.
It's where farmers can bring their animals to one place and get fodder and water.
It didn't rain.
Cattle camp was extended for 18 months.
Kerabai used to move around in the cattle camp and sing the songs of encouragement.
Kerabai became very popular.
It rained and cattle camp was ended, but after cattle camp ended, Kerabai came to our radio -- we have community radio which has more than 100,000 listeners.
She said, "I want to have a regular show on the radio.
" Our radio manager said, "Kerabai, you cannot read and write.
How will you write the script?
" You know what she replied?
"I cannot read and write, but I can sing.
What's the big deal?
" (Laughter) And today, Kerabai is doing a regular radio program, and not only that, she's become a famous radio jockey and she has been invited by all of the radios, even from Mumbai.
She gets the invitation and she does the show.
(Applause) Kerabai has become a local celebrity.
One day I asked Kerabai, "How did you end up singing?
" She said, "Shall I tell you the real fact?
When I was pregnant with my first child, I was always hungry.
I did not have enough food to eat.
I did not have enough money to buy food, and so to forget my hunger, I started singing.
" So strong and wise, no?
I always think that our women overcome so many obstacles -- cultural, social, financial -- and they find out their ways.
I would like to share another story: Sunita Kamble.
She has taken a course in a business school, and she has become a veterinary doctor.
She's Dalit; she comes from an untouchable caste, but she does artificial insemination in goats.
It is a very male-dominated profession and it is all the more difficult for Sunita because Sunita comes from an untouchable caste.
But she worked very hard.
She did successful goat deliveries in the region and she became a famous goat doctor.
Recently, she got a national award.
I went to Sunita's house to celebrate -- to congratulate her.
When I entered the village, I saw a big cutout of Sunita.
Sunita was smiling on that picture.
I was really surprised to see an untouchable, coming from the village, having a big cutout at the entrance of the village.
When I went to her house, I was even more amazed because upper caste leaders -- men -- were sitting in the house, in her house, and having chai and water, which is very rare in India.
Upper caste leaders do not go to an untouchable's house and have chai or water.
And they were requesting her to come and address the gathering of the village.
Sunita broke centuries-old caste conditioning in India.
(Applause) Let me come to what the younger generations do.
As I'm standing here -- I'm so proud as I stand here, from Mhaswad to Vancouver.
Back home, Sarita Bhise -- she's not even 16 years old. She's preparing herself -- she's a part of our sports program, Champions' program.
She's preparing herself to represent India in field hockey.
And you know where she's going?
She's going to represent in 2020 Olympics, Tokyo.
(Applause) Sarita comes from a very poor shepherd community.
I am just -- I couldn't be more proud of her.
There are millions of women like Sarita, Kerabai, Sunita, who can be around you also.
They can be all over the world, but at first glance you may think that they do not have anything to say, they do not have anything to share.
You would be so wrong.
I am so lucky that I'm working with these women.
They are sharing their stories with me, they are sharing their wisdom with me, and I'm just lucky to be with them.
20 years before -- and I'm so proud -- we went to Reserve Bank of India and we set up the first rural women's bank.
Today they are pushing me to go to National Stock Exchange to set up the first fund dedicated to micro rural women entrepreneurs.
They are pushing me to set up the first small finance women's bank in the world.
And as one of them said, "My courage is my capital.
" And I say here, their courage is my capital.
And if you want, it can be yours also.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Cancer. It's a devastating disease that takes an enormous emotional toll.
Not only on the patient, but the patient's loved ones, as well.
It is a battle that the human race has been fighting for centuries.
And while we've made some advancements, we still haven't beaten it.
Two out of five people in the US will develop cancer in their lifetime.
Of those, 90 percent will succumb to the disease due to metastases.
Metastasis is a spread of cancer from a primary site to a distal site, through the circulatory or the lymphatic system.
For instance, a female patient with breast cancer doesn't succumb to the disease simply because she has a mass on her breast.
She succumbs to the disease because it spreads to the lungs, liver, lymph nodes, brain, bone, where it becomes unresectable or untreatable.
Metastasis is a complicated process.
One that I've studied for several years now.
And something that my team and I discovered recently was that cancer cells are able to communicate with each other and coordinate their movement, based on how closely packed they are in the tumor microenvironment.
They communicate with each other through two signaling molecules called Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-8. Now, like anything else in nature, when things get a little too tight, the signal is enhanced, causing the cancer cells to move away faster from the primary site and spread to a new site.
So, if we block this signal, using a drug cocktail that we developed, we can stop the communication between cancer cells and slow down the spread of cancer.
Let me pause here for a second and take you back to when this all began for me in 2010, when I was just a sophomore in college.
I had just started working in Dr Danny Wirtz's lab at Johns Hopkins University.
And I'll be honest: I was a young, naive, Sri Lankan girl, (Laughter) who had no previous research experience.
And I was tasked to look at how cancer cells move in a 3D collagen I matrix that recapsulated, in a dish, the conditions that cancer cells are exposed to in our bodies.
This was new and exciting for me, because previous work had been done on 2D, flat, plastic dishes that really weren't representative of what the cancer cells are exposed to in our bodies.
Because, let's face it, the cancer cells in our bodies aren't stuck onto plastic dishes.
It was during this time that I attended a seminar conducted by Dr Bonnie Bassler from Princeton University, where she talked about how bacteria cells communicate with each other, based on their population density, and perform a specific action.
It was at this moment that a light bulb went off in my head, and I thought, "Wow, I see this in my cancer cells every day, when it comes to their movement.
And fortunately, I work for someone who is open to running with my crazy ideas. So, I threw myself into this project.
However, I couldn't do it by myself.
I needed help. I definitely needed help.
So we recruited undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and professors from different institutions and multiple disciplines to come together and work on this idea that I conceived as a sophomore in college.
After years of conducting experiments together and merging different ideas and perspectives, we discovered a new signaling pathway that controls how cancer cells communicate with each other and move, based on their cell density.
Some of you might have heard this, because most of social media knows it as the Hasini effect.
(Laughter) (Applause) And we weren't done yet.
This was a significant finding, because currently, there aren't any FDA-approved therapeutics that directly target the spread of cancer.
In fact, the spread of cancer, metastasis, is thought of as a byproduct of tumor growth.
Where the idea is, if we can stop the tumor from growing, we can stop the tumor from spreading.
However, most of us know that this is not true.
We, on the other hand, came up with the drug cocktail that targets metastasis not by targeting tumor growth, but by targeting the complex mechanisms that govern it, through the targeting of the Hasini effect.
(Laughter) This work was recently published in "Nature Communications," and my team and I received an overwhelming response from around the world.
Nobody on my team could have predicted this sort of response.
We seem to have struck a nerve.
The undergraduate students who demonstrated superhuman powers through their hard work and dedication.
The graduate students and the postdoctoral fellows, my fellow Avengers, who taught me new techniques and always made sure I stayed on track.
The professors, my Yodas and my Obi-Wan Kenobis, who brought their expertise into making this work into what it is today.
The support staff, the friends and family, people who lifted our spirits, and never let us give up on our ambitious endeavors.
The best kind of sidekicks we could have asked for.
It took a village to help me study metastasis.
And believe me, without my village, I wouldn't be here.
Today, our team has grown, and we are using the Hasini effect to develop combination therapies that will effectively target tumor growth and metastases.
We are engineering new anticancer therapeutics, to limit toxicity and to reduce drug resistance.
And we are developing groundbreaking systems that will help for the development of better human clinical trials.
I recognize that right now, I am on this incredible journey that allows me to pursue work that I am extremely passionate about, and something that feeds my curiosity on a daily basis.
But I have to say, my favorite part of all of this -- other than, of course, being here, talking to you, today -- is the fact that I get to work with a diverse group of people, who make my work stronger, better and just so much more fun.
And because of this, I have to say that collaboration is my favorite superhuman power.
And what I love about this power is that it's not unique to me.
It's within all of us.
My work shows that even cancer cells use collaboration to invade our bodies and spread their wrath.
For us humans, it is a superpower that has produced incredible discoveries in the medical and scientific field.
And it is the superpower that we can all turn to to inspire us to create something bigger than ourselves, that will help make the world a better place.
Collaboration is the superpower that I turn to, to help me fight cancer.
And I am confident that with the right collaborations, we will beat this terrible disease.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Come with me to Agbogbloshie, a neighborhood in the heart of Accra, named after a god that lives in the Odaw River.
There's a slum, Old Fadama, built on land reclaimed from the Korle Lagoon, just before it opens into the Gulf of Guinea.
There's a scrapyard here where people take apart all kinds of things, from mobile phones to computers, automobiles to even entire airplanes.
Agbogbloshie's scrapyard is famous because it has become a symbol of the downside of technology: the problem of planned obsolescence.
It's seen as a place where devices from around the world end their life, where your data comes to die.
These are the images that the media loves to show, of young men and boys burning wires and cables to recover copper and aluminum, using Styrofoam and old tires as fuel, seriously hurting themselves and the environment.
It's a super-toxic process, producing pollutants that enter the global ecosystem, build up in fatty tissue and threaten the top of the food chain.
But this story is incomplete.
There's a lot we can learn from Agbogbloshie, where scrap collected from city- and nationwide is brought.
For so many of us, our devices are black boxes. We know what they do, but not how they work or what's inside.
In Agbogbloshie, people make it their business to know exactly what's inside.
Scrap dealers recover copper, aluminum, steel, glass, plastic and printed circuit boards.
It's called "urban mining.
" It's now more efficient for us to mine materials from our waste.
There is 10 times more gold, silver, platinum, palladium in one ton of our electronics than in one ton of ore mined from beneath the surface of the earth. In Agbogbloshie, weight is a form of currency.
Devices are dissected to recover materials, parts and components with incredible attention to detail, down to the aluminum tips of electric plugs.
But scrap dealers don't destroy components that are still functional.
They supply them to repair workshops like this one in Agbogbloshie and the tens of thousands of technicians across the country that refurbish electrical and electronic equipment, and sell them as used products to consumers that may not be able to buy a new television or a new computer.
Make no mistake about it, there are young hackers in Agbogbloshie -- and I mean that in the very best sense of that word -- that know not only how to take apart computers but how to put them back together, how to give them new life.
Agbogbloshie reminds us that making is a cycle.
It extends to remaking and unmaking in order to recover the materials that enable us to make something anew.
We can learn from Agbogbloshie, where cobblers remake work boots, where women collect plastic from all over the city, sort it by type, shred it, wash it and ultimately sell it back as feedstock to factories to make new clothing, new plastic buckets and chairs.
What's really cool as well is that there's a transfer of skills and knowledge across generations, from masters to apprentices, but it's done through active learning, through heuristic learning, learning by doing and by making.
And this stands in sharp contrast to the experience of many students in school, where lecturers lecture, and students write things down and memorize them.
It's boring, but the real problem is this somehow preempts their latent or their inherent entrepreneurial power.
They know books but not how to make stuff.
We took forays into the scrapyard to look for what could be repurposed, like DVD writers that could become laser etchers, or the power supplies of old servers for a start-up in Kumasi making 3D printers out of e-waste.
We built the app specifically with the needs of the scrap dealers in mind first, because we realized that it was not enough to arm them with information and upgraded technology if we wanted them to green their recycling processes; they needed incentives.
Scrap dealers are always looking for new scrap and new buyers and what interests them is finding buyers who will pay more for clean copper than for burnt.
We realized that in the entire ecosystem, everyone was searching for something.
Makers are searching for materials, parts, components, tools, blueprints to make what it is they want to make.
They're also finding a way to let customers and clientele find out that they can repair a blender or fix an iron or, as we learned yesterday, to make a french fry machine.
We tried to untangle that knot of not knowing to allow people to find what they need to make what they want to make.
We've tested the app in Agbogbloshie and are getting ready to open it up to other maker ecosystems.
In six months, we'll have finished three years of testing the makerspace kiosk, which I have to admit, we've subjected to some pretty horrific abuse. But it's for a good cause, because based on the results of that testing, we've been able to redesign an upgraded version of this makerspace.
If a fab lab is large, expensive, and fixed in place, think of this as the counterpoint: something low-cost, which can be locally manufactured, which can be expanded and kitted out incrementally as makers acquire resources.
You can think of it as a toolshed, where makers can come and check out tools and take them via handcart to wherever they want in the city to make what it is they want to make.
And moving into the next phase, we're planning to also add ceiling-mounted CNC bots, which allow makers to cocreate together with robots. Ultimately, this is a kit of parts, which can be assembled locally within the informal sector using standardized parts which can be upgraded collectively through an open-source process.
And this is very relevant if we want to think about an inclusive future for Africa today.
If, in the future, someone tells you Agbogbloshie is the largest e-waste dump in the world, I hope you can correct them and explain to them that a dump is a place where you throw things away and leave them forever; a scrapyard is where you take things apart.
Waste is something that no longer has any value, whereas scrap is something that you recover specifically to use it to remake something new.
Making is a cycle, and African makerspaces are already pioneering and leading circular economy at the grassroots.
Let's make more and better together. Thank you. (Applause)
Three people are at a dinner party. Paul, who’s married, is looking at Linda. Meanwhile, Linda is looking at John, who’s not married. Is someone who’s married looking at someone who’s not married?
One study asked people to estimate several statistics related to the scope of climate change.
Finally, for disagreements that can’t be definitively settled with statistics or evidence, making a convincing argument may depend on engaging the audience’s values.
For example, researchers have conducted a number of studies where they’ve asked people of different political backgrounds to rank their values.
Liberals in these studies, on average, rank fairness— here meaning whether everyone is treated in the same way—above loyalty.
In later studies, researchers attempted to convince liberals to support military spending with a variety of arguments.
Arguments based on fairness— like that the military provides employment and education to people from disadvantaged backgrounds— were more convincing than arguments based on loyalty— such as that the military unifies a nation.
These three elements— beliefs, trusted sources, and values— may seem like a simple formula for finding agreement and consensus.
The problem is that our initial inclination is to think of arguments that rely on our own beliefs, trusted sources, and values.
And even when we don’t, it can be challenging to correctly identify what’s held dear by people who don’t already agree with us.
The best way to find out is simply to talk to them.
In the course of discussion, you’ll be exposed to counter-arguments and rebuttals.
These can help you make your own arguments and reasoning more convincing and sometimes, you may even end up being the one changing your mind.
I'm an artist.
Being an artist is the greatest job there is.
And I really pity each and every one of you who has to spend your days discovering new galaxies or saving humanity from global warming.
(Laughter) But being an artist is also a daunting job.
I spend every day, from nine to six, doing this.
(Laughter) I even started a side career that consists entirely of complaining about the difficulty of the creative process.
(Laughter) But today, I don't want to talk about what makes my life difficult.
You're fluent in the language of reading images.
Deciphering an image like that takes quite a bit of an intellectual effort.
But nobody ever taught you how this works, you just know it.
College, shopping, music.
What makes a language powerful is that you can take a very complex idea and communicate it in a very simple, efficient form.
These images represent exactly the same ideas.
But when you look, for example, at the college hat, you know that this doesn't represent the accessory you wear on your head when you're being handed your diploma, but rather the whole idea of college.
Now, what drawings can do is they cannot only communicate images, they can even evoke emotions.
Let's say you get to an unfamiliar place and you see this.
You feel happiness and relief.
(Laughter) Or a slight sense of unease or maybe downright panic.
(Laughter) Or blissful peace and quiet.
(Laughter) But visuals, they're of course more than just graphic icons.
You know, if I want to tell the story of modern-day struggle, I would start with the armrest between two airplane seats and two sets of elbows fighting.
What I love there is this universal law that, you know, you have 30 seconds to fight it out and once it's yours, you get to keep it for the rest of the flight.
(Laughter) Now, commercial flight is full of these images.
If I want to illustrate the idea of discomfort, nothing better than these neck pillows.
What I do occasionally is I fall into a sort of painful coma.
And when I wake up from that, I have the most terrible taste in my mouth.
It's a taste that's so bad, it cannot be described with words, but it can be drawn.
(Laughter) The thing is, you know, I love sleeping. And when I sleep, I really prefer to do it while spooning.
I've been spooning on almost a pro level for close to 20 years, but in all this time, I've never figured out what to do with that bottom arm.
(Laughter) (Applause) And the only thing -- the only thing that makes sleeping even more complicated than trying to do it on an airplane is when you have small children.
They show up at your bed at around 4am with some bogus excuse of, "I had a bad dream.
" (Laughter) And then, of course you feel sorry for them, they're your kids, so you let them into your bed. And I have to admit, at the beginning, they're really cute and warm and snugly.
The minute you fall back asleep, they inexplicably -- (Laughter) start rotating.
(Laughter) We like to call this the helicopter mode.
(Laughter) Now, the deeper something is etched into your consciousness, the fewer details we need to have an emotional reaction.
(Laughter) So why does an image like this work?
It works, because we as readers are incredibly good at filling in the blanks.
Now, when you draw, there's this concept of negative space.
And the idea is, that instead of drawing the actual object, you draw the space around it.
So the bowls in this drawing are empty.
But the black ink prompts your brain to project food into a void.
What we see here is not a owl flying.
What we actually see is a pair of AA batteries standing on a nonsensical drawing, and I animate the scene by moving my desk lamp up and down.
(Laughter) The image really only exists in your mind.
So, how much information do we need to trigger such an image?
My goal as an artist is to use the smallest amount possible.
I try to achieve a level of simplicity where, if you were to take away one more element, the whole concept would just collapse.
And that's why my personal favorite tool as an artist is abstraction.
I've come up with this system which I call the abstract-o-meter, and this is how it works.
So you take a symbol, any symbol, for example the heart and the arrow, which most of us would read as the symbol for love, and I'm an artist, so I can draw this in any given degree of realism or abstraction.
Now, if I go too realistic on it, it just grosses everybody out.
(Laughter) If I go too far on the other side and do very abstract, nobody has any idea what they're looking at.
So I have to find the perfect place on that scale, in this case it's somewhere in the middle.
Now, once we have reduced an image to a more simple form, all sorts of new connections become possible.
And that allows for totally new angles in storytelling.
(Laughter) And so, what I like to do is, I like to take images from really remote cultural areas and bring them together.
Now, with more daring references -- (Laughter) I can have more fun.
But of course, I know that eventually things become so obscure that I start losing some of you.
So as a designer, it's absolutely key to have a good understanding of the visual and cultural vocabulary of your audience.
With this image here, a comment on the Olympics in Athens, I assumed that the reader of the "New Yorker" would have some rudimentary idea of Greek art.
If you don't, the image doesn't work.
But if you do, you might even appreciate the small detail, like the beer-can pattern here on the bottom of the vase.
(Laughter) A recurring discussion I have with magazine editors, who are usually word people, is that their audience, you, are much better at making radical leaps with images than they're being given credit for.
And the only thing I find frustrating is that they often seem to push me towards a small set of really tired visual clichés that are considered safe.
You know, it's the businessman climbing up a ladder, and then the ladder moves, morphs into a stock market graph, and anything with dollar signs; that's always good.
(Laughter) If there are editorial decision makers here in the audience, I want to give you a piece of advice.
Every time a drawing like this is published, a baby panda will die.
(Laughter) Literally.
(Laughter) (Applause) When is a visual cliché good or bad?
It's a fine line.
And it really depends on the story.
In 2011, during the earthquake and the tsunami in Japan, I was thinking of a cover.
And I went through the classic symbols: the Japanese flag, "The Great Wave" by Hokusai, one of the greatest drawings ever. And then the story changed when the situation at the power plant in Fukushima got out of hand.
And I remember these TV images of the workers in hazmat suits, just walking through the site, and what struck me was how quiet and serene it was.
And so I wanted to create an image of a silent catastrophe.
And that's the image I came up with. (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) What I want to do is create an aha moment, for you, for the reader.
And unfortunately, that does not mean that I have an aha moment when I create these images.
I never sit at my desk with the proverbial light bulb going off in my head.
What it takes is actually a very slow, unsexy process of minimal design decisions that then, when I'm lucky, lead to a good idea.
So one day, I'm on a train, and I'm trying to decode the graphic rules for drops on a window.
And eventually I realize, "Oh, it's the background blurry upside-down, contained in a sharp image.
" And I thought, wow, that's really cool, and I have absolutely no idea what to do with that.
A while later, I'm back in New York, and I draw this image of being stuck on the Brooklyn bridge in a traffic jam.
It's really annoying, but also kind of poetic.
And only later I realized, I can take both of these ideas and put them together in this idea.
And what I want to do is not show a realistic scene.
But, maybe like poetry, make you aware that you already had this image with you, but only now I've unearthed it and made you realize that you were carrying it with you all along.
But like poetry, this is a very delicate process that is neither efficient nor scalable, I think. And maybe the most important skill for an artist is really empathy.
You need craft and you need -- (Laughter) you need creativity -- (Laughter) thank you -- to come up with an image like that.
But then you need to step back and look at what you've done from the perspective of the reader.
I've tried to become a better artist by becoming a better observer of images.
And it usually just means I'm blank for a long while. And the only trick that eventually works is if I open my mind and run through every image I have stored up there, and see if something clicks.
And if it does, just add a few lines of ink to connect -- to preserve this very short moment of inspiration.
And the great lesson there was that the real magic doesn't happen on paper.
It happens in the mind of the viewer.
When your expectations and your knowledge clash with my artistic intentions.
Your interaction with an image, your ability to read, question, be bothered or bored or inspired by an image is as important as my artistic contribution.
Because that's what turns an artistic statement really, into a creative dialogue.
And so, your skill at reading images is not only amazing, it is what makes my art possible.
And for that, I thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you. (Applause)
(Banjo plays) (Banjo and guitar play) (Sings) Is this what it's like to be alive?
What is history?
It is something written by the winners.
There is a stereotype that history should be focused on the rulers, like Lenin or Trotsky.
As a result, people in many countries, like mine, Russia, look at history as something that was predetermined or determined by the leaders, and common people could not influence it in any way.
Many Russians today do not believe that Russia could ever have been or ever will be a truly democratic nation, and this is due to the way history has been framed to the citizens of Russia.
And this is not true.
To prove it, I spent two years of my life trying to go 100 years back, to the year 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution.
I asked myself, what if the internet and Facebook existed 100 years ago?
So last year, we built a social network for dead people, named Project1917.com. My team and I created our software, digitized and uploaded all possible real diaries and letters written by more than 3,000 people 100 years ago.
So any user of our website or application can follow a news feed for each day of 1917 and read what people like Stravinsky or Trotsky, Lenin or Pavlova and others thought and felt.
We watch all those personalities being ordinary people like you and me, not demigods, and we see that history consists of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, not only their "genius ideas.
" Our project was a shock for many Russians, who used to think that our country has always been an autocratic empire and the ideas of freedom and democracy could never have prevailed, just because democracy was not our destiny.
But if we take a broader look, it's not that black and white.
Yes, 1917 led to 70 years of communist dictatorship.
But with this project, we see that Russia could have had a different history and a democratic future, as any other country could or still can.
Reading the posts from 1917, you learn that Russia was the first country in the world to abolish the death penalty, or one of the first ones to grant women voting rights.
Knowing history and understanding how ordinary people influenced history can help us create a better future, because history is just a rehearsal of what's happening right now.
But we are making that history alive by imagining what if all the main characters could use mobile phones . . . just like that?
Ordinary people matter.
They have an impact.
Ideas matter.
Journalists, scientists, philosophers matter.
We all make history.
Thank you.

We shape society.

(Applause)
We wanted to give people the tools to see that change and take action.
Today, Planet images the entire Earth, every single day.
And we now have over 200 satellites in orbit, downlinking their data to 31 ground stations we built around the planet.
Consumer-mapping companies are using it to improve the maps you find online.
We initially created this tool for news journalists, who wanted to get unbiased information about world events.
OK, so humanity now has this database of information about the planet, changing over time.
What's our next mission, what's Mission 2? In short, it's space plus AI.
What we're doing with artificial intelligence is finding the objects in all the satellite images.
The same AI tools that are used to find cats in videos online can also be used to find information on our pictures.
So, imagine if you can say, this is a ship, this is a tree, this is a car, this is a road, this is a building, this is a truck.
And if you could do that for all of the millions of images coming down per day, then you basically create a database of all the sizable objects on the planet, every day.
And that database is searchable.
So that's exactly what we're doing.
Here's a prototype, working on our API.
This is Beijing.
So, imagine if we wanted to count the planes in the airport.
We select the airport, and it finds the planes in today's image, and finds the planes in the whole stack of images before it, and then outputs this graph of all the planes in Beijing airport over time.
Of course, you could do this for all the airports around the world.
And let's look here in the port of Vancouver.
So, we would do the same, but this time we would look for vessels.
So, we zoom in on Vancouver, we select the area, and we search for ships.
And it outputs where all the ships are.
Now, imagine how useful this would be to people in coast guards who are trying to track and stop illegal fishing.
See, legal fishing vessels transmit their locations using AIS beacons.
But we frequently find ships that are not doing that.
The pictures don't lie.
And so, coast guards could use that and go and find those illegal fishing vessels.
And soon we'll add not just ships and planes but all the other objects, and we can output data feeds of those locations of all these objects over time that can be integrated digitally from people's work flows.
In time, we could get more sophisticated browsers that people pull in from different sources.
But ultimately, I can imagine us abstracting out the imagery entirely and just having a queryable interface to the Earth.
Imagine if we could just ask, "Hey, how many houses are there in Pakistan?
Give me a plot of that versus time.
" "How many trees are there in the Amazon and can you tell me the locations of the trees that have been felled between this week and last week?
" Wouldn't that be great?
Well, that's what we're trying to go towards, and we call it "Queryable Earth.
" So, Planet's Mission 1 was to image the whole planet every day and make it accessible.
Planet's Mission 2 is to index all the objects on the planet over time and make it queryable.
Let me leave you with an analogy.
Google indexed what's on the internet and made it searchable.
Well, we're indexing what's on the Earth and making it searchable.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)Four years ago, here at TED, I announced Planet's Mission 1: to launch a fleet of satellites that would image the entire Earth, every day, and to democratize access to it.
The problem we were trying to solve was simple.
Satellite imagery you find online is old, typically years old, yet human activity was happening on days and weeks and months, and you can't fix what you can't see.
We wanted to give people the tools to see that change and take action.
The beautiful Blue Marble image, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972 had helped humanity become aware that we're on a fragile planet.
And we wanted to take it to the next level, to give people the tools to take action, to take care of it.
Well, after many Apollo projects of our own, launching the largest fleet of satellites in human history, we have reached our target.
Today, Planet images the entire Earth, every single day.
Mission accomplished.
(Applause) Thank you.
It's taken 21 rocket launches -- this animation makes it look really simple -- it was not.
And we now have over 200 satellites in orbit, downlinking their data to 31 ground stations we built around the planet.
In total, we get 1.5 million 29-megapixel images of the Earth down each day.
And on any one location of the Earth's surface, we now have on average more than 500 images.
A deep stack of data, documenting immense change.
And lots of people are using this imagery.
Agricultural companies are using it to improve farmers' crop yields.
Consumer-mapping companies are using it to improve the maps you find online.
Governments are using it for border security or helping with disaster response after floods and fires and earthquakes.
And lots of NGOs are using it.
So, for tracking and stopping deforestation. Or helping to find the refugees fleeing Myanmar. Or to track all the activities in the ongoing crisis in Syria, holding all sides accountable.
And today, I'm pleased to announce Planet stories. Anyone can go online to planet. com open an account and see all of our imagery online.
It's a bit like Google Earth, except it's up-to-date imagery, and you can see back through time.
You can compare any two days and see the dramatic changes that happen around our planet.
Or you can create a time lapse through the 500 images that we have and see that change dramatically over time.
And you can share these over social media.
It's pretty cool.
(Applause) Thank you.
We initially created this tool for news journalists, who wanted to get unbiased information about world events.
But now we've opened it up for anyone to use, for nonprofit or personal uses.
And we hope it will give people the tools to find and see the changes on the planet and take action.
OK, so humanity now has this database of information about the planet, changing over time.
What's our next mission, what's Mission 2? In short, it's space plus AI.

Architecture is amazing, for sure.
We got 30 of those people -- actually, on that site, we got more than 1,400 people, coming from 60 different nationalities.
To put together 1,400 people, coming from such different places, is a miracle.
Almost 5,000 people. And this is another site in Japan, building the Kansai Airport.
Again, all the rock climbers, Japanese ones.
You know, making buildings together is the best way to create a sense of cooperation. The sense of pride -- pride is essential.
But, you know, construction, of course, is one of the reasons why architecture is amazing.
But there is another one, that is maybe even more amazing.
Because architecture is the art of making shelter for communities, not just for individuals -- communities and society at large. And society is never the same.
The world keeps changing.
And changes are difficult to swallow by people.
And architecture is a mirror of those changes.
Architecture is the built expression of those changes.
So, this is why it is so difficult, because those changes create adventure.
They create adventure, and architecture is adventure.
This is the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, a long time ago.
That was back in time, '77. This was a spaceship landing in the middle of Paris.
Together with my friend in adventure, Richard Rogers, we were, at the time, young bad boys.
Young, bad boys.
(Laughter) It was really only a few years after May '68. So it was a rebellion, pure rebellion.
The idea was to make the proof that cultural buildings should not be intimidating. They should create a sense of curiosity.
This is the way to create a cultural place.
Curiosity is the beginning of a cultural attitude.
And there's a piazza there, you can see that piazza.
And a piazza is the beginning of urban life.
A piazza is the place where people meet.
And they mix experience.
And they mix ages.
And, you know, in some way, you create the essence of the city.
And since then, we made, in the office, so many other places for people. Here, in Rome, is a concert hall.
Another place for people.
This building inside is actually designed by the sound, you can see.
It's flirting with sound.
And this is the Kansai Airport, in Japan.
To make a building, sometimes you need to make an island, and we made the island.
The building is more than one mile long.
It looks like an immense glider, landing on the ground. And this is in San Francisco.
Another place for people.
This building is the California Academy of Sciences.
And we planted on that roof -- thousands and thousands of plants that use the humidity of the air, instead of pumping water from the water table.
The roof is a living roof, actually.
And this building was made Platinum LEED.
The LEED is the system to measure, of course, the sustainability of a building.
So this was also a place for people that will stay a long time.
And this is actually New York.
This is the new Whitney, in the Meatpacking District in New York.
Well, another flying vessel.
Another place for people.
Here we are in Athens, the Niarchos Foundation. It's a library, it's an open house, a concert hall and a big park.
This building is also a Platinum LEED building.
This building actually captures the sun's energy with that roof.
But, you know, making a building a place for people is good.
Making libraries, making concert halls, making universities, making museums is good, because you create a place that's open, accessible.
You create a building for a better world, for sure.
But there is something else that makes architecture amazing, even more.
And this is the fact that architecture doesn't just answer to need and necessity, but also to desires -- yes, desires -- dreams, aspirations.
This is what architecture does.
Even the most modest hut on earth is not just a roof.
It's more than a roof.
It's telling a story; it's telling a story about the identity of the people living in that hut. Individuals. Architecture is the art of telling stories.
Like this one.
In London: the Shard of Glass.
Well, this building is the tallest building in Western Europe.
It goes up more than 300 meters in the air, to breathe fresh air.
The facets of this building are inclined, and they reflect the sky of London, that is never the same. After rain, everything becomes bluish.
In the sunny evening, everything is red.
It's something that is difficult to explain.
It's what we call the soul of a building.
On this picture on the left, you have the Menil Collection, used a long time ago.
It's a museum.
On the right is the Harvard Art Museum.
Both those two buildings flirt with light.
Light is probably one of the most essential materials in architecture. And this is in Amsterdam.
This building is flirting with water.
And this is my office, on the sea. Well, this is flirting with work.
Actually, we enjoy working there.
And that cable car is the little cable car that goes up to there.
That's "The New York Times" in New York.
Well, this is playing with transparency.
Again, the sense of light, the sense of transparency.
On the left here, you have the Magic Lantern in Japan, in Ginza, in Tokyo.
And in the center is a monastery in the forest.
This monastery is playing with the silence and the forest.
And a museum, a science museum.
This is about levitation.
And this is in the center of Paris, in the belly of the whale.
This is the Pathé Foundation in Paris.
All those buildings have something in common: it's that something is searching for desire, for dreams.
And that's me.
(Laughter) Well, it's me on my sailing boat.
Flirting with breeze.
Well, there's not a very good reason to show you this picture.
(Laughter) I'm trying, I'm trying.
You know, one thing is clear: I love sailing, for sure.
I actually also love designing sailing boats.
But I love sailing, because sailing is associated with slowness.
And . . . and silence. And the sense of suspension.
And there is another thing that this picture says.
It says that I'm Italian.
(Laughter) Well, there is very little I can do about that.
(Laughter) I'm Italian, and I love beauty.
I love beauty.
Well, let's go sailing, I want to take you sailing here, to this place, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
This is the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Center.
It's for the Kanaky ethnic group.
It's in Nouméa, New Caledonia.
This place is for art.
Art and nature.
And those buildings actually flirt with the wind, with the trade winds.
They have a sound, they have a voice, those buildings.
I'm showing this because it's about beauty.
It's about pure beauty.
And let's talk about beauty for a moment.
Beauty is like the bird of paradise: the very moment you try to catch it, it flies away.
Your arm is too short.
But beauty is not a frivolous idea.
It's the opposite.
In my native language, that is Italian, "beautiful" is "bello.
" In Spanish, "beauty" is "belleza.
" In Greek, "beautiful" is "kalos.
" When you add "agathos," that means "beautiful and good.
" In no one of those languages, "beautiful" just means "beautiful.
" It also means "good. " Real beauty is when the invisible joins the visible, coming on surface.
And this doesn't apply only to art or nature.
This applies to science, human curiosity, solidarity -- that's the reason why you may say, "This is a beautiful person," "That's a beautiful mind.
" This, this is the beauty that can change people into better people, by switching a special light in their eyes.
And making buildings for this beauty makes cities better places to live.
And better cities make better citizens.
Well, this beauty -- this universal beauty, I should say -- is one of the few things that can change the world.
Believe me, this beauty will save the world. One person at a time, but it will do it. Thank you. (Applause)Architecture is amazing, for sure.
It's amazing because it's art.
But you know, it's a very funny kind of art.
It's an art at the frontier between art and science.
It's fed by . . . by real life, every day.
It's driven by force of necessity.
Quite amazing, quite amazing. And the life of the architect is also amazing.
You know, as an architect, at 10 o’clock in the morning, you need to be a poet, for sure.
But at 11, you must become a humanist, otherwise you'd lose your direction.
And at noon, you absolutely need to be a builder.
You need to be able to make a building, because architecture, at the end, is the art of making buildings.
Architecture is the art of making shelter for human beings. Period. And this is not easy at all.
It's amazing.
Look at this.
Here we are in London, at the top of the Shard of Glass.
This is a building we completed a few years ago.
Those people are well-trained workers, and they are assembling the top piece of the tower.
Well, they look like rock climbers.
They are.
I mean, they are defying the force of gravity, like building does, by the way.
We got 30 of those people -- actually, on that site, we got more than 1,400 people, coming from 60 different nationalities.
You know, this is a miracle. It's a miracle.
To put together 1,400 people, coming from such different places, is a miracle.
Sites are miracles.
This is another one.
Let's talk about construction.
Adventure, it's adventure in real life, not adventure in spirit.
This guy there is a deepwater diver.
From rock climbers to deepwater divers.
This is in Berlin.
After the fall of the Wall in '89, we built this building, connecting East Berlin to West Berlin, in Potsdamer Platz.
We got on that project almost 5,000 people.
Almost 5,000 people. And this is another site in Japan, building the Kansai Airport.
You know, making buildings together is the best way to create a sense of cooperation. The sense of pride -- pride is essential.
Curiosity is the beginning of a cultural attitude.
Another place for people.
This is the new Whitney, in the Meatpacking District in New York.
Here we are in Athens, the Niarchos Foundation. It's a library, it's an open house, a concert hall and a big park.
But, you know, making a building a place for people is good.
On this picture on the left, you have the Menil Collection, used a long time ago.
And a museum, a science museum.
But I love sailing, because sailing is associated with slowness.
" This, this is the beauty that can change people into better people, by switching a special light in their eyes.
And making buildings for this beauty makes cities better places to live.
And better cities make better citizens.
I am in your friendship circle hidden in plain sight.
Months of slow pay and no pay have decimated my credit.
I don't remember exactly when it stopped, but I cannot deny now having entered the uncertain world of formerly and used to be.
I'm not sure anymore where I belong.
What I do know is that dozens of online job applications seem to just disappear into a black hole.
I'm wondering what is to become of me.
So far my health has held up, but my body aches -- or is it my spirit?
I wrote this piece a year ago.
It's a composite of my story and other women I know.
Nobody I knew was traveling the world or buying a condo in Costa Rica.
And the truth is, it really doesn't take much.
The median household in the US only has enough savings to replace one month of income. Forty-seven percent of us cannot pull together 400 dollars to deal with an emergency.
That's almost half of us.
A major car repair and we're standing on the abyss.
You wouldn't know it to look around you -- I'm not the only one in this situation.
There are people in this room who are in the same predicament, and if it's not you, it is your parents or your sister or maybe your best friend.
We get good at faking normal.
Shame keeps us silent and siloed.
When I first decided I was going to come out with my story, I did a website and a friend noticed that there were no photos of me -- it was all kind of cartoons like this.
Even as I was coming out, I was still hiding.
We live in a world where success is defined by income.
When you say that you have money problems, you're announcing pretty much that you're a loser.
When you're a graduate of Harvard Business School as I am, you're some kind of double loser.
We boomers hear a lot about how we have underfunded our retirement; how it's all our fault.
Why on earth would we draw down our 401(k) plan to cover the shortfall on our mother-in-law's nursing home care, or to pay for our kid's tuition, or just to survive?
We're accused of being poor planners and deadbeats -- all that money we spent on lattes and bottled water.
To shame and blame is so deliciously tempting.
Many of us don't even wait for others to do it we're so busy doing it to ourselves.
I say let's own our part: we all could have saved more.
I know I could have saved more, and if you were to rifle through my life over the last 30 years, you would see more than one dumb thing I have done financially.
I can't change that now and neither can you, but let's not mix up individual, isolated behavior with the systemic factors that have caused a 7.7-trillion-dollar retirement income gap.
Millions of boomer-age Americans did not land here because of too many trips to Starbucks.
We spent the last three decades dealing with flat and falling wages and disappearing pensions and through-the-roof cost on housing and health care and education.
It used to not be like this.
We all remember the three-legged retirement income stool which had the savings and pension and social security.
Well, that stool has gone wobbly.
Take savings -- what savings?
For many families, there's just nothing left to save after the bills have been paid.
The pension leg of the stool has also gone wobbly.
We can remember when many people had pensions.
Today only 13 percent of American workers are employed by companies that offer them.
So what did we get instead?
We got 401(k)-type plans and suddenly responsibility for retirement planning got shifted from our companies to us.
We got the reigns but we also got the risk, and it turns out that millions of us just aren't that good at voluntarily investing over 40 years.
Millions of us just aren't that good at managing market risk.
And really the numbers tell the story.
Half of all American households have no retirement savings at all.
That would be zero.
No 401(k), no IRA, not a dime.
Among 55-to-64-year-olds who do have a retirement account, the median value of that account is 104,000 dollars.
Now, 104,000 dollars does sound better than zero, but as an annuity, it generates about 300 dollars.
I don't have to tell you that you can't live on that.
With savings down, pensions becoming a relic of the past and 401(k) plans failing millions of Americans, many near-retirees are dependent on social security as their retirement plan.
But here's the problem.
Social security was never supposed to be the retirement plan. It's not nearly enough.
At best it replaces something like 40 percent of your pre-retirement income.
That's not the pattern today.
If you're in your late 50s and in good health, you're going to live easily another 20 or 25 years.
That's a really long time to make ends meet if you are broke.
So what's the play if you've landed here and you're 50 or 55 or 60? What's the play if you don't want to land here and you're 22 or 32? Here's what I've learned from my own experience. The cavalry's not coming.
There is no big rescue, no prince charming, no big bailout in the works.
To have a shot at something other than being old and poor in America, we're going to have to save ourselves and each other.
I've had to come out of the shadows, stand here openly, and I'm inviting you to do so as well.
I'm not going to tell you that it's not easy.
I ventured though to tell my story because I thought it would make it a little easier for people to tell theirs. I think it's only through our strength in numbers that we can begin to change the national "la-la" conversation that we are having on this retirement crisis.
I believe from this base that we can find our voices again and sound the alarm -- start pushing our institutions and policymakers to go hard on this retirement crisis with the urgency it deserves.
In the meantime -- and there is an "in the meantime" -- we're going to have to adopt a live-low-to-the-ground mindset, drastically cutting back on our expenses.
And I don't mean just living within our means.
A lot of people are already doing that.
What is called for now is to, in a much deeper way, ask ourselves what it really means to live a life that is not defined by things.
I call it "smalling up.
" Smalling up is figuring out what you really need to feel contented and grounded.
I have a friend who drives really beat-up, raggedy cars, but he will scrimp and save 15,000 dollars at one point to buy a flute because music is what really matters to him.
He smalled up.
I've had to also let go of magical thinking -- this idea that if I just was patient enough and tightened my belt that things would go back to normal.
If I just sent in one more CV or applied to one more job online or attended one more networking event that surely I'd get the kind of job I was used to having.
Surely things would return to normal.
The truth is I'm not going back and neither are you.
The normal that we knew is over.
In this new place that we are, we're going to be asked to do things that we don't want to do.
We're going to be asked to take assignments that we think are beneath our station and our talent and our skill.
I have had to get off my throne.
Last year, a good friend of mine asked me if I would help her with some organization work.
I assumed she meant community organizing along the lines of what President Obama did in Chicago.
She meant organizing somebody's closet.
I said, "I'm not doing that.
" She said, "Get off your throne.
Money is green.
" It's not easy being part of the advance team that is ushering in this new era of work and living.
First is always hardest.
First is before there are networks and pathways and role models . . . before there are policies and ways to show us how to go forward.
We're in the middle of a seismic shift, and we're going to have to find bridgework to get us through. 
Bridgework is what we do in the meantime; bridgework is what we do while we're trying to figure out what is next.
Bridgework is also letting go of this notion that our worth and our value depend on our income and our titles and our jobs.
Bridgework doesn't mean that we don't want to build on our past careers, that we don't want meaningful work.
We do.
Bridgework is what we do in the meantime while we're figuring out what is next.
I've also learned to think strategy not failure when I'm sort of processing all these things that I don't want to do.
And I say that that's an approach that I would invite you to consider as well.
So if you need to move in with your brother to make ends meet, call him.
If you need to take in a boarder to help you pay your mortgage or pay your rent, do it. If you need to get food stamps, get the darn food stamps.
AARP says only a third of older adults who are eligible actually get them.
Do what you need to do to go another round.
Know that there are millions of us.
Come out of the shadows.
Cut back, small up; think strategy, not failure; get off your throne and find the bridgework to get your through the lean times. As a country, we have achieved longevity, investing billions of dollars in the diagnosis, treatment and management of disease.
It's not enough to just live a long time.
We want to live well.
We haven't invested nearly as much in the physical infrastructure to ensure that that happens.
We need now a new way of thinking about what it means to be old in America.
And we need guidance and ideas about how to live a richly textured life on a much more modest income.
So I am calling on change agents and social entrepreneurs, artists and elders and impact investors. I'm calling on developers and disrupters of the status quo.
We need you to help us imagine how to invest in the services and products and infrastructure that will support our dignity, our independence and our well-being in these many, many decades that we're going to live.
My journey has taken me from a place of fear and shame to one of humility and understanding.
I'm ready now to link shields with others, to fight this fight, and I'm inviting you to join me.
Thank you.
(Applause)You know me.
I am in your friendship circle hidden in plain sight.
These days I'm buying the $1.99 trial-size jug of Tide to make ends meet.
I bet you didn't know laundry detergent came in that size.
You invite me to the same expensive restaurants the two of us have always enjoyed, but I order mineral water now with a twist of lemon, not the 12-dollar glass of chardonnay.
I am frugal in my menu choices.
Meticulous, I count every penny in my head.
I demur dividing the table bill evenly to cover desserts and designer coffees and second and third glasses of wine I did not consume.
I am tired of trying to fake appearances.
A friend told me that I'm broke not poor, and there is a difference.
I live without cable, my gym membership and nail appointments. I've discovered I can do my own hair.
There is no retirement savings, no nest egg. I exhausted that long ago.
There is no expensive condo to draw equity and no husband to back me up.
Months of slow pay and no pay have decimated my credit.
Bill collectors call constantly, reading verbatim from a script before expressing polite sympathy for my plight and then demanding payment arrangements I can't possibly meet.
Friends wonder privately how someone so well educated could be in economic free fall.
I'm still as talented as ever and smart as a whip, but work is sketchy now, mostly on and off consulting gigs.
At 55 I've learned how to fake cheeriness, but there are not many opportunities for work anymore.
I don't remember exactly when it stopped, but I cannot deny now having entered the uncertain world of formerly and used to be.
I'm not sure anymore where I belong.
What I do know is that dozens of online job applications seem to just disappear into a black hole.
I'm wondering what is to become of me.
So far my health has held up, but my body aches -- or is it my spirit?
Homeless women used to be invisible to me but I appraise them now with curious eyes, wondering if their stories started like mine.
I wrote this piece a year ago.
It's a composite of my story and other women I know.
I wrote it because I was tired of pretending I was all right when I wasn't.
I was tired of faking normal.
I wasn't seeing myself in the popular press.
Nobody I knew was traveling the world or buying a condo in Costa Rica.
We may not have hit rock bottom, but many of us saw a sequence of events where rock bottom was possible for the first time.
The median household in the US only has enough savings to replace one month of income. Forty-seven percent of us cannot pull together 400 dollars to deal with an emergency.
That's almost half of us.
You wouldn't know it to look around you -- I'm not the only one in this situation.
There are people in this room who are in the same predicament, and if it's not you, it is your parents or your sister or maybe your best friend.
We get good at faking normal.
Shame keeps us silent and siloed.
When I first decided I was going to come out with my story, I did a website and a friend noticed that there were no photos of me -- it was all kind of cartoons like this.
Even as I was coming out, I was still hiding.
We live in a world where success is defined by income.
When you say that you have money problems, you're announcing pretty much that you're a loser.
When you're a graduate of Harvard Business School as I am, you're some kind of double loser.
We boomers hear a lot about how we have underfunded our retirement; how it's all our fault.
We're accused of being poor planners and deadbeats -- all that money we spent on lattes and bottled water.
To shame and blame is so deliciously tempting.
Many of us don't even wait for others to do it we're so busy doing it to ourselves.
I say let's own our part: we all could have saved more.
I know I could have saved more, and if you were to rifle through my life over the last 30 years, you would see more than one dumb thing I have done financially.
I can't change that now and neither can you, but let's not mix up individual, isolated behavior with the systemic factors that have caused a 7.7-trillion-dollar retirement income gap.
Millions of boomer-age Americans did not land here because of too many trips to Starbucks.
We spent the last three decades dealing with flat and falling wages and disappearing pensions and through-the-roof cost on housing and health care and education.
It used to not be like this.
We all remember the three-legged retirement income stool which had the savings and pension and social security.
Well, that stool has gone wobbly.
For many families, there's just nothing left to save after the bills have been paid.
So what did we get instead?
We got 401(k)-type plans and suddenly responsibility for retirement planning got shifted from our companies to us.
That would be zero.
No 401(k), no IRA, not a dime.
Among 55-to-64-year-olds who do have a retirement account, the median value of that account is 104,000 dollars.
Social security was never supposed to be the retirement plan. It's not nearly enough.
That's not the pattern today.
If you're in your late 50s and in good health, you're going to live easily another 20 or 25 years.
There is no big rescue, no prince charming, no big bailout in the works.
To have a shot at something other than being old and poor in America, we're going to have to save ourselves and each other.
I've had to come out of the shadows, stand here openly, and I'm inviting you to do so as well.
I'm not going to tell you that it's not easy.
I ventured though to tell my story because I thought it would make it a little easier for people to tell theirs. I think it's only through our strength in numbers that we can begin to change the national "la-la" conversation that we are having on this retirement crisis.
I call it "smalling up.
I have a friend who drives really beat-up, raggedy cars, but he will scrimp and save 15,000 dollars at one point to buy a flute because music is what really matters to him.
I've had to also let go of magical thinking -- this idea that if I just was patient enough and tightened my belt that things would go back to normal.
The normal that we knew is over.
Money is green.
So if you need to move in with your brother to make ends meet, call him.
Come out of the shadows.
We want to live well.
Thank you.
And from this new vantage point, I've observed something that is far less familiar to me, propelling so much of China's innovation and many of its entrepreneurs.
So when capital and investment become focused on the needs of people who are hanging to the bottom rungs of an economic ladder, that's when we start to see the internet truly become a job creator, an education enabler and in many other ways, a path forward.
Of course, China is not the only place where this alternative fuel exists, nor the only place where it is possible.
But because of the country's sheer scale and status as a rising superpower, the needs of its population have created an opportunity for truly compelling impact.
When explaining the rapid growth of the Chinese tech industry, many observers will cite two reasons.
The first is the 1.4 billion people that call China home. The second is the government's active participation -- or pervasive intervention, depending on how you view it.
Now, the central authorities have spent heavily on network infrastructure over the years, creating an attractive environment for investment.
At the same time, they've insisted on standards and regulation, which has led to fast consensus and therefore, fast adoption.
The world's largest pool of tech talent exists because of the abundance of educational incentives.
And local, domestic companies, in the past, have been protected from international competition by market controls.
Yet, the internet has continued to grow, and it is so big -- much bigger than I think most of us realize. By the end of 2017, the Chinese internet population had reached 772 million users.
Ninety-two percent of them use messaging apps. There are now 650 million digital news consumers, 580 million digital video consumers, and the country's largest e-commerce platform, Taobao, now boasts 580 million monthly active users. It's about 80 percent larger than Amazon.
On-demand travel, between bikes and cars, now accounts for 10 billion trips a year in China.
That's two-thirds of all trips taken around the world. So it's a very mixed bag.
The internet exists in a restricted, arguably manipulated form within China, yet it is massive and has vastly improved the lives of its citizens.
So even in its imperfection, the growth of the Chinese internet should not be dismissed, and it's worthy of our closer examination.
" This is any rural village where at least 10 percent of its households are selling goods online and making a certain amount of revenue.
And the growth has been significant in the last few years.
He expects to hire 30 more people in the next year, as his demand rapidly rises. There are 60 million left-behind children scattered across China's rural landscape.
He walks an hour each way every single day to school, across these deep ravines, in an isolated landscape.
And there's still more to come. In America, internet population, or penetration, has now reached 88 percent.
In China, the internet has still only reached 56 percent of the populous. That means there are over 600 million people who are still offline and disconnected.
That's nearly twice the US population.
Thank you.
But the travel options are very limited; plane tickets cost nearly half of their monthly salary.
So most of them, they choose the train. Their average journey is 700 kilometers. The average travel time is 15 and a half hours.
And the country's tracks now have to handle 390 million travelers every Spring Festival.
Until recently, migrant workers would have to queue for long hours -- sometimes days -- just to buy tickets, often only to be fleeced by scalpers.
And they still had to deal with near-stampede conditions when travel day finally arrived.
But technology has started to ease this experience. Mobile and digital tickets now account for 70 percent of sales, greatly reducing the lines at train stations.
Digital ID scanners have replaced manual checks, expediting the boarding process, and artificial intelligence is deployed across the network to optimize travel routes. New solutions have been invented.
That's about the distance from Miami to Boston. This enormous need of migrant workers has powered fast upgrade and innovation across the country's transport systems.
Now, the Chinese internet has developed in both familiar and unfamiliar ways.
So I am well acquainted with this type of fuel. But about a year and a half ago, I moved from my home in New York City to Hong Kong to become the CEO of the South China Morning Post.
And from this new vantage point, I've observed something that is far less familiar to me, propelling so much of China's innovation and many of its entrepreneurs.
It is an overwhelming need economy that is serving an underprivileged populous, which has been separated for 30 years from China's economic boom.
The stark gaps that exist between the rich and the poor, between urban and rural or the academic and the unschooled -- these gaps, they form a soil that's ready for some incredible empowerment.
So when capital and investment become focused on the needs of people who are hanging to the bottom rungs of an economic ladder, that's when we start to see the internet truly become a job creator, an education enabler and in many other ways, a path forward.
Of course, China is not the only place where this alternative fuel exists, nor the only place where it is possible.

That's larger than the populations of the United States, Russia, of Germany, of the United Kingdom, of France and Canada combined.
Ninety-eight percent of them are active on mobile.
Ninety-two percent of them use messaging apps. There are now 650 million digital news consumers, 580 million digital video consumers, and the country's largest e-commerce platform, Taobao, now boasts 580 million monthly active users. It's about 80 percent larger than Amazon.

Let me tell you two other stories today. Luo Zhaoliu is a 34-year-old engineer from Jiangxi province. Now, his home region used to be extremely important to the Communist party because this was the birthplace of the Red Army.
" This is any rural village where at least 10 percent of its households are selling goods online and making a certain amount of revenue.
He expects to hire 30 more people in the next year, as his demand rapidly rises.

(Applause)
" What comes to mind?
There is a course offered at nearly every university, and it's called Organic Chemistry, and it is a grueling, heavy introduction to the subject, a flood of content that overwhelms students, and you have to ace it if you want to become a doctor or a dentist or a veterinarian.
It's not good for science, and it's not good for society, and I don't think it has to be this way.
Would you let me try?
Audience: Yeah!
Jakob Magolan: All right, let's go for it.
(Laughter) Here I have one of these overpriced EpiPens.
Epinephrine can restart the beat of my heart, or it could stop a life-threatening allergic reaction.
An injection of this right here will do it.
It would be like turning the ignition switch in my body's fight-or-flight machinery.
Epinephrine has been the difference between life and death for many people.
This is what organic chemistry looks like.
It looks like lines and letters . . . No meaning to most people.
I see a physical object that has depth and rotating parts, and it's moving.
We call this a compound or a molecule, and it is 26 atoms that are stitched together by atomic bonds.
The unique arrangement of these atoms gives epinephrine its identity, but nobody has ever actually seen one of these, because they're very small, so we're going to call this an artistic impression, and I want to explain to you how small this is.
It's the mass of a grain of sand.
Seven billion of us on this planet? Maybe 400 billion stars in our galaxy?
Epinephrine is so small we will never see it, not through any microscope ever, but we know what it looks like, because it shows itself through some sophisticated machines with fancy names like "nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers. " So visible or not, we know this molecule very well.
We know it is made of four different types of atoms, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.
These are the colors we typically use for them.
Everything in our universe is made of little spheres that we call atoms.
There's about a hundred of these basic ingredients, and they're all made from three smaller particles: protons, neutrons, electrons.
We arrange these atoms into this familiar table. We give them each a name and a number.
But life as we know it doesn't need all of these, just a smaller subset, just these.
And there are four atoms in particular that stand apart from the rest as the main building blocks of life, and they are the same ones that are found in epinephrine: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.
Now what I tell you next is the most important part.
When these atoms connect to form molecules, they follow a set of rules.
Hydrogen makes one bond, oxygen always makes two, nitrogen makes three and carbon makes four.
That's it.
HONC -- one, two, three, four.
If you can count to four, and you can misspell the word "honk," you're going to remember this for the rest of your lives.
(Laughter) Now here I have four bowls with these ingredients.
We can use these to build molecules.
Let's start with epinephrine.
Now, these bonds between atoms, they're made of electrons.
Atoms use electrons like arms to reach out and hold their neighbors.
Two electrons in each bond, like a handshake, and like a handshake, they are not permanent.
They can let go of one atom and grab another.
That's what we call a chemical reaction, when atoms exchange partners and make new molecules.
The backbone of epinephrine is made mostly of carbon atoms, and that's common.
Carbon is life's favorite structural building material, because it makes a good number of handshakes with just the right grip strength.
That's why we define organic chemistry as the study of carbon molecules.
That's why oxygen gets called O2. I can show you combustion.
Here's carbon dioxide, CO2. Above it, let's place water and oxygen, and beside it, some flammable fuels.
These fuels are made of just hydrogen and carbon.
That's why we call them hydrocarbons.
We're very creative.
They are not optional, and they're not optional for bigger molecules either, like these three.
This is our favorite vitamin sitting next to our favorite drug, (Laughter) and morphine is one of the most important stories in medical history.
It marks medicine's first real triumph over physical pain, and every molecule has a story, and they are all published.
They're written by scientists, and they're read by other scientists, so we have handy representations to do this quickly on paper, and I need to teach you how to do that.
We don't actually draw these carbons.
We save time by just hiding them.
They're represented by corners between the bonds, and we also hide every hydrogen that's bonded to a carbon.
We know they're there whenever a carbon is showing us any fewer than four bonds.
The last thing that's done is the bonds between OH and NH.
We just get rid of those to make it cleaner, and that's all there is to it.
This is the professional way to draw molecules.
This is what you see on Wikipedia pages.
It takes a little bit of practice, but I think everyone here could do it, but for today, this is epinephrine.
This is also called adrenaline. They're one and the same.
It's made by your adrenal glands. You have this molecule swimming through your body right now.
It's a natural molecule.
This EpiPen would just give you a quick quintillion more of them.
(Laughter) We can extract epinephrine from the adrenal glands of sheep or cattle, but that's not where this stuff comes from.
We make this epinephrine in a factory by stitching together smaller molecules that come mostly from petroleum.
And this is 100 percent synthetic.
And that word, "synthetic," makes some of us uncomfortable.
It's not like the word "natural," which makes us feel safe.
But these two molecules, they cannot be distinguished.
We're not talking about two cars that are coming off an assembly line here.
A car can have a scratch on it, and you can't scratch an atom.
These two are identical in a surreal, almost mathematical sense.
At this atomic scale, math practically touches reality.
And a molecule of epinephrine . . . it has no memory of its origin.
It just is what it is, and once you have it, the words "natural" and "synthetic," they don't matter, and nature synthesizes this molecule just like we do, except nature is much better at this than we are.
Before there was life on earth, all the molecules were small, simple: carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen, just simple things.
The emergence of life changed that.
Life brought biosynthetic factories that are powered by sunlight, and inside these factories, small molecules crash into each other and become large ones: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, multitudes of spectacular creations.
Nature is the original organic chemist, and her construction also fills our sky with the oxygen gas we breathe, this high-energy oxygen.
All of these molecules are infused with the energy of the sun.
They store it like batteries.
So nature is made of chemicals.
Maybe you guys can help me to reclaim this word, "chemical," because it has been stolen from us.
It doesn't mean toxic, and it doesn't mean harmful, and it doesn't mean man-made or unnatural.
It just means "stuff," OK?
(Laughter) You can't have chemical-free lump charcoal.
That is ridiculous.
(Laughter) And I'd like to do one more word.
The word "natural" doesn't mean "safe," and you all know that.
Plenty of nature's chemicals are quite toxic, and others are delicious, and some are both . . . (Laughter) toxic and delicious.
The only way to tell whether something is harmful is to test it, and I don't mean you guys.
Professional toxicologists: we have these people.
They're well-trained, and you should trust them like I do.
So nature's molecules are everywhere, including the ones that have decomposed into these black mixtures that we call petroleum.
We refine these molecules.
There's nothing unnatural about them.
We purify them.
Now, our dependence on them for energy -- that means that every one of those carbons gets converted into a molecule of CO2. That's a greenhouse gas that is messing up our climate.
Maybe knowing this chemistry will make that reality easier to accept for some people, I don't know, but these molecules are not just fossil fuels.
They're also the cheapest available raw materials for doing something that we call synthesis.
We're using them like pieces of LEGO.
We have learned how to connect them or break them apart with great control.
I have done a lot of this myself, and I still think it's amazing it's even possible.
What we do is kind of like assembling LEGO by dumping boxes of it into washing machines, but it works.
We can make molecules that are exact copies of nature, like epinephrine, or we can make creations of our own from scratch, like these two. One of these eases the symptoms of multiple sclerosis; the other one cures a type of blood cancer that we call T-cell lymphoma.
A molecule with the right size and shape, it's like a key in a lock, and when it fits, it interferes with the chemistry of a disease.
That's how drugs work.
Natural or synthetic, they're all just molecules that happen to fit snugly somewhere important.
But nature is much better at making them than we are, so hers look more impressive than ours, like this one.
This is called vancomycin.
She gave this majestic beast two chlorine atoms to wear like a pair of earrings.
We found vancomycin in a puddle of mud in a jungle in Borneo in 1953. It's made by a bacteria.
We can't synthesize this cost-efficiently in a lab.
It's too complicated for us, but we can harvest it from its natural source, and we do, because this is one of our most powerful antibiotics.
And new molecules are reported in our literature every day.
We make them or we find them in every corner of this planet.
And that's where drugs come from, and that's why your doctors have amazing powers . . . (Laughter) to cure deadly infections and everything else. Being a physician today is like being a knight in shining armor.
They fight battles with courage and composure, but also with good equipment.
So let's not forget the role of the blacksmith in this picture, because without the blacksmith, things would look a little different . . . (Laughter) But this science is bigger than medicine.
It is oils and solvents and flavors, fabrics, all plastics, the cushions that you're sitting on right now -- they're all manufactured, and they're mostly carbon, so that makes all of it organic chemistry.
This is a rich science.
But I didn't come here to teach you guys organic chemistry -- I just wanted to show it to you, and I had a lot of help with that today from a young man named Weston Durland, and you've already seen him.
He's an undergraduate student in chemistry, and he also happens to be pretty good with computer graphics.
(Laughter) So Weston designed all the moving molecules that you saw today.
He and I wanted to demonstrate through the use of graphics like these to help someone talk about this intricate science.
But our main goal was just to show you that organic chemistry is not something to be afraid of.
It is, at its core, a window through which the beauty of the natural world looks richer. Thank you. (Applause)I'd like you to ask yourself, what do you feel when you hear the words "organic chemistry?
" What comes to mind?
There is a course offered at nearly every university, and it's called Organic Chemistry, and it is a grueling, heavy introduction to the subject, a flood of content that overwhelms students, and you have to ace it if you want to become a doctor or a dentist or a veterinarian.
And that is why so many students perceive this science like this . . . as an obstacle in their path, and they fear it and they hate it and they call it a weed-out course.
What a cruel thing for a subject to do to young people, weed them out.
And this perception spread beyond college campuses long ago. There is a universal anxiety about these two words.
I happen to love this science, and I think this position in which we have placed it is inexcusable.
It's not good for science, and it's not good for society, and I don't think it has to be this way.
And I don't mean that this class should be easier.
It shouldn't. But your perception of these two words should not be defined by the experiences of premed students who frankly are going through a very anxious time of their lives.
So I'm here today because I believe that a basic knowledge of organic chemistry is valuable, and I think that it can be made accessible to everybody, and I'd like to prove that to you today.
Would you let me try?
Audience: Yeah!
Jakob Magolan: All right, let's go for it.
(Laughter) Here I have one of these overpriced EpiPens.
Inside it is a drug called epinephrine.
Epinephrine can restart the beat of my heart, or it could stop a life-threatening allergic reaction.
An injection of this right here will do it.
It would be like turning the ignition switch in my body's fight-or-flight machinery.
My heart rate, my blood pressure would go up so blood could rush to my muscles. My pupils would dilate. I would feel a wave of strength.
Epinephrine has been the difference between life and death for many people.
This is like a little miracle that you can hold in your fingers.
Here is the chemical structure of epinephrine.
This is what organic chemistry looks like.
It looks like lines and letters . . . No meaning to most people.
I'd like to show you what I see when I look at that picture.
I see a physical object that has depth and rotating parts, and it's moving.
We call this a compound or a molecule, and it is 26 atoms that are stitched together by atomic bonds.
The unique arrangement of these atoms gives epinephrine its identity, but nobody has ever actually seen one of these, because they're very small, so we're going to call this an artistic impression, and I want to explain to you how small this is.
In here, I have less than half a milligram of it dissolved in water.
It's the mass of a grain of sand.
The number of epinephrine molecules in here is one quintillion.
That's 18 zeroes.
That number is hard to visualize.
Seven billion of us on this planet? Maybe 400 billion stars in our galaxy?
You're not even close.
If you wanted to get into the right ballpark, you'd have to imagine every grain of sand on every beach, under all the oceans and lakes, and then shrink them all so they fit in here.
Epinephrine is so small we will never see it, not through any microscope ever, but we know what it looks like, because it shows itself through some sophisticated machines with fancy names like "nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers. " So visible or not, we know this molecule very well.
We know it is made of four different types of atoms, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.

But life as we know it doesn't need all of these, just a smaller subset, just these.
And there are four atoms in particular that stand apart from the rest as the main building blocks of life, and they are the same ones that are found in epinephrine: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.
When these atoms connect to form molecules, they follow a set of rules.
Hydrogen makes one bond, oxygen always makes two, nitrogen makes three and carbon makes four.
That's it.
(Laughter) Now here I have four bowls with these ingredients.
Let's start with epinephrine.
Atoms use electrons like arms to reach out and hold their neighbors.
They can let go of one atom and grab another.
The backbone of epinephrine is made mostly of carbon atoms, and that's common.
That's why we define organic chemistry as the study of carbon molecules.
Here's carbon dioxide, CO2. Above it, let's place water and oxygen, and beside it, some flammable fuels.
This is our favorite vitamin sitting next to our favorite drug, (Laughter) and morphine is one of the most important stories in medical history.
We don't actually draw these carbons.
We save time by just hiding them.
This is the professional way to draw molecules.
A car can have a scratch on it, and you can't scratch an atom.
These two are identical in a surreal, almost mathematical sense.
Before there was life on earth, all the molecules were small, simple: carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen, just simple things.
So nature is made of chemicals.
Maybe you guys can help me to reclaim this word, "chemical," because it has been stolen from us.
It just means "stuff," OK?
Now, our dependence on them for energy -- that means that every one of those carbons gets converted into a molecule of CO2. That's a greenhouse gas that is messing up our climate.
Maybe knowing this chemistry will make that reality easier to accept for some people, I don't know, but these molecules are not just fossil fuels.
We're using them like pieces of LEGO.
I have done a lot of this myself, and I still think it's amazing it's even possible.
We can make molecules that are exact copies of nature, like epinephrine, or we can make creations of our own from scratch, like these two. One of these eases the symptoms of multiple sclerosis; the other one cures a type of blood cancer that we call T-cell lymphoma.
We found vancomycin in a puddle of mud in a jungle in Borneo in 1953. It's made by a bacteria.
They fight battles with courage and composure, but also with good equipment.
He's an undergraduate student in chemistry, and he also happens to be pretty good with computer graphics.
Together, they served 89 years for murders that they didn't commit; murders that they falsely confessed to committing when they were teenagers.
We already know what happened, OK?Police 2: If we don't get honesty here -- I'm your friend right now, but I've got to believe in you, and if I don't believe in you, I can't go to bat for you. OK? You're nodding.
Tell us what happened. P1: Your mom said you'd be honest with us. P2: And she's behind you 100 percent no matter what happens here. P1: That's what she said, because she thinks you know more, too.
We can't make any promises, but we'll stand behind you no matter what you did, OK?
Huh?
B: Not really. M: What do you mean, "Not really"?
I'd like to introduce you to a tiny microorganism that you've probably never heard of: its name is Prochlorococcus, and it's really an amazing little being.
For one thing, its ancestors changed the earth in ways that made it possible for us to evolve, and hidden in its genetic code is a blueprint that may inspire ways to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel.
But the most amazing thing is that there are three billion billion billion of these tiny cells on the planet, and we didn't know they existed until 35 years ago.
So to tell you their story, I need to first take you way back, four billion years ago, when the earth might have looked something like this.
There was no life on the planet, there was no oxygen in the atmosphere.
So what happened to change that planet into the one we enjoy today, teeming with life, teeming with plants and animals?
Well, in a word, photosynthesis.
About two and a half billion years ago, some of these ancient ancestors of Prochlorococcus evolved so that they could use solar energy and absorb it and split water into its component parts of oxygen and hydrogen.
And they used the chemical energy produced to draw CO2, carbon dioxide, out of the atmosphere and use it to build sugars and proteins and amino acids, all the things that life is made of.
And as they evolved and grew more and more over millions and millions of years, that oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere.
Until about 500 million years ago, there was enough in the atmosphere that larger organisms could evolve.
There was an explosion of life-forms, and, ultimately, we appeared on the scene.
While that was going on, some of those ancient photosynthesizers died and were compressed and buried, and became fossil fuel with sunlight buried in their carbon bonds.
They're basically buried sunlight in the form of coal and oil.
Today's photosynthesizers, their engines are descended from those ancient microbes, and they feed basically all of life on earth.
Your heart is beating using the solar energy that some plant processed for you, and the stuff your body is made out of is made out of CO2 that some plant processed for you.
Basically, we're all made out of sunlight and carbon dioxide.
Fundamentally, we're just hot air.
(Laughter) So as terrestrial beings, we're very familiar with the plants on land: the trees, the grasses, the pastures, the crops.
But the oceans are filled with billions of tons of animals.
Do you ever wonder what's feeding them?
Well there's an invisible pasture of microscopic photosynthesizers called phytoplankton that fill the upper 200 meters of the ocean, and they feed the entire open ocean ecosystem.
Some of the animals live among them and eat them, and others swim up to feed on them at night, while others sit in the deep and wait for them to die and settle down and then they chow down on them.
So these tiny phytoplankton, collectively, weigh less than one percent of all the plants on land, but annually they photosynthesize as much as all of the plants on land, including the Amazon rainforest that we consider the lungs of the planet.
Every year, they fix 50 billion tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide into their bodies that feeds the ocean ecosystem.
How does this tiny amount of biomass produce as much as all the plants on land?
Well, they don't have trunks and stems and flowers and fruits and all that to maintain.
All they have to do is grow and divide and grow and divide.
They're really lean little photosynthesis machines.
They really crank.
So there are thousands of different species of phytoplankton, come in all different shapes and sizes, all roughly less than the width of a human hair.
Here, I'm showing you some of the more beautiful ones, the textbook versions.
I call them the charismatic species of phytoplankton.
And here is Prochlorococcus. I know, it just looks like a bunch of schmutz on a microscope slide.
But first I want to tell you how they were discovered.
And so we used this instrument for several years to study our phytoplankton cultures, species like those charismatic ones that I showed you, just studying their basic cell biology.
But all that time, we thought, well wouldn't it be really cool if we could take an instrument like this out on a ship and just squirt seawater through it and see what all those diversity of phytoplankton would look like.
So I managed to get my hands on what we call a big rig in flow cytometry, a large, powerful laser with a money-back guarantee from the company that if it didn't work on a ship, they would take it back.
And so a young scientist that I was working with at the time, Rob Olson, was able to take this thing apart, put it on a ship, put it back together and take it off to sea. And it worked like a charm.
We didn't think it would, because we thought the ship's vibrations would get in the way of the focusing of the laser, but it really worked like a charm.
And so we mapped the phytoplankton distributions across the ocean.
For the first time, you could look at them one cell at a time in real time and see what was going on -- that was very exciting.
But one day, Rob noticed some faint signals coming out of the instrument that we dismissed as electronic noise for probably a year before we realized that it wasn't really behaving like noise.
It had some regular patterns to it.
To make a long story short, it was tiny, tiny little cells, less than one-one hundredth the width of a human hair that contain chlorophyl.
That was Prochlorococcus.
So remember this slide that I showed you?
If you shine blue light on that same sample, this is what you see: two tiny little red light-emitting cells.
Those are Prochlorococcus.
They are the smallest and most abundant photosynthetic cell on the planet.
At first, we didn't know what they were, so we called the "little greens.
" It was a very affectionate name for them.
Ultimately, we knew enough about them to give them the name Prochlorococcus, which means "primitive green berry.
" And it was about that time that I became so smitten by these little cells that I redirected my entire lab to study them and nothing else, and my loyalty to them has really paid off.
They've given me a tremendous amount, including bringing me here.
(Applause) So over the years, we and others, many others, have studied Prochlorococcus across the oceans and found that they're very abundant over wide, wide ranges in the open ocean ecosystem.
They're particularly abundant in what are called the open ocean gyres.
These are sometimes referred to as the deserts of the oceans, but they're not deserts at all.
Their deep blue water is teeming with a hundred million Prochlorococcus cells per liter.
If you crowd them together like we do in our cultures, you can see their beautiful green chlorophyl.
One of those test tubes has a billion Prochlorococcus in it, and as I told you earlier, there are three billion billion billion of them on the planet.
That's three octillion, if you care to convert.
(Laughter) And collectively, they weigh more than the human population and they photosynthesize as much as all of the crops on land.
They're incredibly important in the global ocean.
So over the years, as we were studying them and found how abundant they were, we thought, hmm, this is really strange.
How can a single species be so abundant across so many different habitats?
And as we isolated more into culture, we learned that they are different ecotypes.
There are some that are adapted to the high-light intensities in the surface water, and there are some that are adapted to the low light in the deep ocean.
So as we studied these more and more and kept finding more and more diversity, we thought, oh my God, how diverse are these things?
It reflects the habitat that they come from.
Think of it this way.
If each cell is a smartphone and the apps are the genes, when you get your smartphone, it comes with these built-in apps.
Those are the ones that you can't delete if you're an iPhone person.
You press on them and they don't jiggle and they don't have x's.
Even if you don't want them, you can't get rid of them.
(Laughter) Those are like the core genes of Prochlorococcus.
They're the essence of the phone.
But you have a huge pool of apps to draw upon to make your phone custom-designed for your particular lifestyle and habitat.
If you travel a lot, you'll have a lot of travel apps, if you're into financial things, you might have a lot of financial apps, or if you're like me, you probably have a lot of weather apps, hoping one of them will tell you what you want to hear.
(Laughter) And I've learned the last couple days in Vancouver that you don't need a weather app -- you just need an umbrella.
So -- (Laughter) (Applause) So just as your smartphone tells us something about how you live your life, your lifestyle, reading the genome of a Prochlorococcus cell tells us what the pressures are in its environment.
It's like reading its diary, not only telling us how it got through its day or its week, but even its evolutionary history.
As we studied -- I said we've sequenced hundreds of these cells, and we can now project what is the total genetic size -- gene pool -- of the Prochlorococcus federation, as we call it.
It's like a superorganism.
And it turns out that projections are that the collective has 80,000 genes.
That's four times the size of the human genome.
But also I inevitably end up thinking about what a masterpiece they are, finely tuned by millions of years of evolution.
With 2,000 genes, they can do what all of our human ingenuity has not figured out how to do yet.
They can take solar energy, CO2 and turn it into chemical energy in the form of organic carbon, locking that sunlight in those carbon bonds.
If we could figure out exactly how they do this, it could inspire designs that could reduce our dependency on fossil fuels, which brings my story full circle.
The fossil fuels that are buried that we're burning took millions of years for the earth to bury those, including those ancestors of Prochlorococcus, and we're burning that now in the blink of an eye on geological timescales.
Carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere. It's a greenhouse gas.
The oceans are starting to warm.
So the question is, what is that going to do for my Prochlorococcus?
And I'm sure you're expecting me to say that my beloved microbes are doomed, but in fact they're not.
Projections are that their populations will expand as the ocean warms to 30 percent larger by the year 2100. Does that make me happy?
Well, it makes me happy for Prochlorococcus of course -- (Laughter) but not for the planet.
So Prochlorococcus has been my muse for the past 35 years, but there are legions of other microbes out there maintaining our planet for us.
They're out there ready and waiting for us to find them so they can tell their stories, too.
Thank you.
(Applause)I'd like to introduce you to a tiny microorganism that you've probably never heard of: its name is Prochlorococcus, and it's really an amazing little being.
For one thing, its ancestors changed the earth in ways that made it possible for us to evolve, and hidden in its genetic code is a blueprint that may inspire ways to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel.

(Laughter) But they're in there, and I'm going to reveal them to you in a minute.
But first I want to tell you how they were discovered.
And the chlorophyl of phytoplankton, which is green, emits red light when you shine blue light on it.
And so we used this instrument for several years to study our phytoplankton cultures, species like those charismatic ones that I showed you, just studying their basic cell biology.
But all that time, we thought, well wouldn't it be really cool if we could take an instrument like this out on a ship and just squirt seawater through it and see what all those diversity of phytoplankton would look like.

Thank you.
Another object or image that captured my imagination when I was younger was a Klan robe.
We have segregated schools, neighborhoods, workplaces, and it's not the people wearing hoods that are keeping these policies in place.
My work is about the long-term impact of slavery.
We're not just dealing with the residue of systemic racism.
It's the basis of every single thing we do.
Again we have intentionally segregated neighborhoods, workplaces and schools.
We have voter suppression.
We have disproportionate representation of minorities incarcerated.
We have environmental racism.
We have police brutality.
I brought you a few things today.
Racism has the power to hide, and when it hides, it's kept safe because it blends in.
I created this robe to illustrate that.
The basis of capitalism in America is slavery.
Slaves were the capital in capitalism.
The first Grand Wizard in 1868, Nathan Bedford Forrest, was a Confederate soldier and a millionaire slave trader.
The wealth that was created from chattel slavery -- that's slaves as property -- would boggle the mind.
Cotton sales alone in 1860 equalled 200 million dollars.
That would equal five billion dollars today.
A lot of that wealth can be seen today through generational wealth.
Oh, I forgot the other crops as well.
You have indigo, rice and tobacco.
In 2015, I made one robe a week for the entire year.
After making 75 robes, I had an epiphany.
I have a realization that white supremacy is there, but the biggest force of white supremacy is not the KKK, it's the normalization of systemic racism.
There was something else I realized.
The robes had no more power over me at all.
But if we as a people collectively look at these objects -- branding irons, shackles, robes -- and realize that they are part of our history, we can find a way to where they have no more power over us.
If we look at systemic racism and acknowledge that it's sown into the very fabric of who we are as a country, then we can actually do something about the intentional segregation in our schools, neighborhoods and workplaces.
But then and only then can we actually address and confront this legacy of slavery and dismantle this ugly legacy of slavery.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Did you know that one of the first fertility drugs was made from the pee of Catholic nuns, and that even the Pope got involved?
So, this is totally true.
Back in the 1950s, scientists knew that when women enter menopause, they start releasing high levels of fertility hormones in their urine.
But there was this doctor named Bruno Lunenfeld, who wondered if he could actually isolate those hormones from the urine and use it to help women who are having trouble getting pregnant.
Obviously, the problem with this was that in order to test this idea, he needed a lot of pee from older women.
And that is not an easy thing to find.
So he and his colleagues got special permission from the Pope to collect gallons and gallons of urine from hundreds of older Catholic nuns.
And in doing so, he actually isolated hormones that are still used to help women get pregnant today, though now, they can be synthesized in a lab, and gallons of pee aren't necessary. So why am I standing up here, telling this wonderfully intellectual audience about nun pee?
Well, I'm a science journalist and multimedia producer, who has always been fascinated by gross stuff.
So fascinated, in fact, that I started a weekly YouTube series called "Gross Science," all about the slimy, smelly, creepy underbelly of nature, medicine and technology.
And after a year and a half of making my show, I can tell you that very often when we explore the gross side of life, we find insights that we never would have thought we'd find, and we even often reveal beauty that we didn't think was there.
I think it's important for us to talk about gross things for a few reasons. So, first of all, talking about gross stuff is a great tool for education, and it's an excellent way to preserve curiosity.
To explain what I mean, why don't I tell you a little bit about what I was like as a child?
So, I was what you might call a gross kid. 
In fact, my love of science itself began when my parents bought me a slime chemistry set and was then only enhanced by doing gross experiments in my sixth-grade biology class.
You know, lots of kids are really into gross things, like playing in dirt or collecting beetles or eating their boogers. And why is that?
I think really little kids are like little explorers.
They just want to experience as much as they can and don't have any idea about the relative acceptability of touching a ladybug versus a stinkbug. They just want to understand how everything works and experience as much of life as they can. And that is pure curiosity.
And through the human capacity for abstraction, this shame can settle in. So we don't necessarily just think, "Oh, my goodness, something really gross is happening to my body!
" We think, "Oh my God, maybe I'm gross. 
And maybe that means that there's something bad or wrong about me.
" The thing is, that if you de facto associate gross stuff with immorality, you lose a huge part of your curiosity, because there is so much out there in the world that is a little bit gross.
Like, think about going for a walk in the woods.
You could just pay attention to the birds and the trees and the flowers and that would be fine, but in my view, you'd be missing a bigger and more awesome picture of life on this planet.
There are cycles of decay that are driving forest growth, and there are networks of fungus beneath your feet that are connecting literally all of the plants around you. That's really amazing.
So I feel like we should be talking about gross stuff early and often with young people, so they feel like they're actually allowed to claim this bigger picture of life on our planet.
And many, many people have experienced this.
But many of the people who have experienced this haven't really had a forum to talk about it. 
And today, this video that I made is my most popular video.
But it also happens to be one of the kinkiest creatures in the animal kingdom. So these guys are hermaphrodites, which means they have both male and female genitalia.
It turns out that these sea hares have a small number of very large neurons, which makes them excellent to use in neuroscience research.
And, in fact, the scientist Eric Kandel used them in his research to understand how memories are stored.
And you know what?
He won a Nobel Prize for his work.

(Laughter) But if scientists had only seen this and they were like, "OK, we're just not going to touch that with a stick," they would have missed the bigger thing about sea hares that makes them really remarkable.
It turns out that these sea hares have a small number of very large neurons, which makes them excellent to use in neuroscience research.

Over the course of our lifetimes, our bodies undergo a series of extraordinary metamorphoses: we grow, experience puberty, and many of us reproduce. Behind the scenes, the endocrine system works constantly to orchestrate these changes.
Each is surrounded by a network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients to manufacture dozens of hormones.
Those hormones are then pumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream.
It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the womb’s lining, preparing the body for menstruation or pregnancy.
An enduring misconception around the endocrine system is that there are exclusively male and female hormones.
Both hormones play a role in pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones that ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child.
Alongside growth and sexual maturity, this system regulates everything from your sleep to the rhythm of your beating heart, exerting its influence over each and every one of your cells.
The endocrine system relies on interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and trillions of cell receptors. Firstly, there are several hormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body.
Each is surrounded by a network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients to manufacture dozens of hormones.
To find its targets, it’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside or on the cell’s surface.
These hormones travel to most of the body’s cells, where they influence how quickly those cells use energy and how rapidly they work.
In turn, that regulates everything from breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion.
Hormones also have some of their most visible—and familiar—effects during puberty.
In men, puberty begins when the testes start secreting testosterone.
That triggers the gradual development of the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice to deepen and height to increase.
They’re frequently viewed as the main drivers of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects, especially during puberty.
But research shows that our behavior is collectively shaped by a variety of influences, including the brain and its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors.
For the last two and a half years, I'm one of the few, if not the only, child psychiatrist operating in refugee camps, shorelines and rescue boats in Greece and the Mediterranean Sea.
And I can say, with great confidence, that we are witnessing a mental-health catastrophe that will affect most of us, and it will change our world.
I live in Haifa, but nowadays, I spend most of my time abroad.
During my time on the Greek island of Lesbos and on the rescue boats in the Mediterranean, thousands of refugee boats arrived to the shoreline, crowded with more than 1.5 million refugees.
One-fourth of them are children, fleeing war and hardship.
Each boat carries different sufferings and traumas from Syria, Iraq, Afganistan and different countries in Africa.
In the last three years alone, more than 12,000 refugees lost their lives.
And hundreds of thousands lost their souls and their mental health due to this cruel and traumatic experience.
I want to tell you about Omar, a five-year-old Syrian refugee boy who arrived to the shore on Lesbos on a crowded rubber boat.
Crying, frightened, unable to understand what's happening to him, he was right on the verge of developing a new trauma.
I knew right away that this was a golden hour, a short period of time in which I could change his story, I could change the story that he would tell himself for the rest of his life.
I could reframe his memories.
I quickly held out my hands and said to his shaking mother in Arabic, (Arabic) "Ateeni elwalad o khudi nafas.
" "Give me the boy, and take a breath.
" His mother gave him to me.
Omar looked at me with scared, tearful eyes and said, (Arabic) "Ammo (uncle in Arabic), shu hada?
" "What is this?
" as he pointed out to the police helicopter hovering above us.
"It's a helicopter!
It's here to photograph you with big cameras, because only the great and the powerful heroes, like you, Omar, can cross the sea.
" Omar looked at me, stopped crying and asked me, (Arabic) "Ana batal?
" I talked to Omar for 15 minutes.
How?
These memories will fight the traumatic ones, if they are reactivated in the future.
Later in the camps, hospitals and through our online clinic that breaks down borders and overcomes languages.
Since our first mission in 2015, "Humanity Crew" had 194 delegations of qualified, trained volunteers and therapists.
The impact on the soul is hardly visible, but the damage can be there for life.
Let's not forget that what distinguishes us humans from machines is the beautiful and the delicate soul within us.
Let's try harder to save more Omars.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Cheers) (Applause)For the last two and a half years, I'm one of the few, if not the only, child psychiatrist operating in refugee camps, shorelines and rescue boats in Greece and the Mediterranean Sea.

" I talked to Omar for 15 minutes.
And I gave his parents some guidance to follow.
This short psychological intervention decreases the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues in the future, preparing Omar to get an education, join the workforce, raise a family and beyond.
How?
By stimulating the good memories that will be stored in the amygdala, the emotional storage of the human brain.
These memories will fight the traumatic ones, if they are reactivated in the future.
To Omar, the smell of the sea will not just remind him of his traumatic journey from Syria.
Because to Omar, this story is now a story of bravery.
This is the power of the golden hour, which can reframe the trauma and establish a new narrative.
But Omar is only one out of more than 350,000 children without the proper mental health support in this crisis alone.
Three hundred and fifty thousand children and me.
We need mental health professionals to join rescue teams during times of active crisis.
This is why my wife and I and friends co-founded "Humanity Crew.
" One of the few aid organizations in the world that specializes in providing psychosocial aid and first-response mental health interventions to refugees and displaced populations.
To provide them with a suitable intervention, we create the four-step approach, a psychosocial work plan that follows the refugees on each step of their journey.
Starting inside the sea, on the rescue boats, as mental health lifeguards.
Later in the camps, hospitals and through our online clinic that breaks down borders and overcomes languages.
And ending in the asylum countries, helping them integrate.
Since our first mission in 2015, "Humanity Crew" had 194 delegations of qualified, trained volunteers and therapists.
We have provided 26,000 hours of mental health support to over 10,000 refugees.
We can all do something to prevent this mental health catastrophe.
We need to acknowledge that first aid is not just needed for the body, but it has also to include the mind, the soul.
The impact on the soul is hardly visible, but the damage can be there for life.
Let's not forget that what distinguishes us humans from machines is the beautiful and the delicate soul within us.
Let's try harder to save more Omars.
A computer now can detect our slightest facial microexpressions and be able to tell the difference between a real smile and a fake one.
But I'm here to tell you that I think that's a thing of the past.
And while that might sound scary, it's not necessarily a bad thing.
And now I bring that together with the capabilities of current technology to create new technology that does make us better, feel more, connect more.
And I believe to do that, we have to be OK losing some of our agency.
Now, stay with me for a moment -- I'm a violinist, not a singer. But the spider's already given me a critical review.
Dementia, diabetes can alter the spectral coloration of our voice.
Changes in our language associated with Alzheimer's can sometimes show up more than 10 years before clinical diagnosis.
What we say and how we say it tells a much richer story than we used to think.
Alright, I want you to watch this clip with me. 
Some things might be going on on the side screens, but try and focus on the image in the front and the man at the window.
(Cheerful music) (Woman laughs) PC: You knew it was coming. 
But it's a lot different when we changed the creator's intent.
We get a chance to reach in and connect to the experience and sentiments that are fundamental to us as humans in our senses, emotionally and socially.
I believe it is the era of the empath.
And we are enabling the capabilities that true technological partners can bring to how we connect with each other and with our technology.
If we recognize the power of becoming technological empaths, we get this opportunity where technology can help us bridge the emotional and cognitive divide.
And in that way, we get to change how we tell our stories. We can enable a better future for technologies like augmented reality to extend our own agency and connect us at a much deeper level.
Imagine a high school counselor being able to realize that an outwardly cheery student really was having a deeply hard time, where reaching out can make a crucial, positive difference.
Or authorities, being able to know the difference between someone having a mental health crisis and a different type of aggression, and responding accordingly. Or an artist, knowing the direct impact of their work.
Leo Tolstoy defined his perspective of art by whether what the creator intended was experienced by the person on the other end.
Today's artists can know what we're feeling.
But regardless of whether it's art or human connection, today's technologies will know and can know what we're experiencing on the other side, and this means we can be closer and more authentic.
But I realize a lot of us have a really hard time with the idea of sharing our data, and especially the idea that people know things about us that we didn't actively choose to share.
Anytime we talk to someone, look at someone or choose not to look, data is exchanged, given away, that people use to learn, make decisions about their lives and about ours.
I'm not looking to create a world where our inner lives are ripped open and our personal data and our privacy given away to people and entities where we don't want to see it go.
But I am looking to create a world where we can care about each other more effectively, we can know more about when someone is feeling something that we ought to pay attention to.
And we can have richer experiences from our technology. Any technology can be used for good or bad. Transparency to engagement and effective regulation are absolutely critical to building the trust for any of this.
But the benefits that "empathetic technology" can bring to our lives are worth solving the problems that make us uncomfortable. And if we don't, there are too many opportunities and feelings we're going to be missing out on. Thank you.
(Applause)What happens when technology knows more about us than we do?
A computer now can detect our slightest facial microexpressions and be able to tell the difference between a real smile and a fake one.
That's only the beginning.
Technology has become incredibly intelligent and already knows a lot about our internal states. And whether we like it or not, we already are sharing parts of our inner lives that's out of our control.
That seems like a problem, because a lot of us like to keep what's going on inside from what people actually see.
We want to have agency over what we share and what we don't.
We all like to have a poker face.
But I'm here to tell you that I think that's a thing of the past.
And while that might sound scary, it's not necessarily a bad thing.
I've spent a lot of time studying the circuits in the brain that create the unique perceptual realities that we each have.
And now I bring that together with the capabilities of current technology to create new technology that does make us better, feel more, connect more.
And I believe to do that, we have to be OK losing some of our agency.
With some animals, it's really amazing, and we get to see into their internal experiences. We get this upfront look at the mechanistic interaction between how they respond to the world around them and the state of their biological systems.
This is where evolutionary pressures like eating, mating and making sure we don't get eaten drive deterministic behavioral responses to information in the world. And we get to see into this window, into their internal states and their biological experiences. It's really pretty cool.
Now, stay with me for a moment -- I'm a violinist, not a singer. But the spider's already given me a critical review.
(Video) (Singing in a low pitch) (Singing in a middle pitch) (Singing in a high pitch) (Singing in a low pitch) (Singing in a middle pitch) (Singing in a high pitch) (Laughter) Poppy Crum: It turns out, some spiders tune their webs like violins to resonate with certain sounds.
And likely, the harmonics of my voice as it went higher coupled with how loud I was singing recreated either the predatory call of an echolocating bat or a bird, and the spider did what it should.
It predictively told me to bug off. I love this.
The spider's responding to its external world in a way that we get to see and know what's happening to its internal world.
Or maybe we don't.Try this with me. 
Your eye responds to how hard your brain is working. 
The response you're about to see is driven entirely by mental effort and has nothing to do with changes in lighting. 
We know this from neuroscience.
When it's not, it contracts.
Groups have shown that changes in the statistics of our language paired with machine learning can predict the likelihood someone will develop psychosis.
I'm going to take it a step further and look at linguistic changes and changes in our voice that show up with a lot of different conditions.
Dementia, diabetes can alter the spectral coloration of our voice.
Changes in our language associated with Alzheimer's can sometimes show up more than 10 years before clinical diagnosis.
What we say and how we say it tells a much richer story than we used to think.
And devices we already have in our homes could, if we let them, give us invaluable insight back.
The chemical composition of our breath gives away our feelings.
There's a dynamic mixture of acetone, isoprene and carbon dioxide that changes when our heart speeds up, when our muscles tense, and all without any obvious change in our behaviors.
Alright, I want you to watch this clip with me. 
Some things might be going on on the side screens, but try and focus on the image in the front and the man at the window.
And that's the point where a lot of us jumped.
It's our collective suspense driving a change in carbon dioxide.
Alright, now, watch this with me one more time.
(Cheerful music) (Woman laughs) PC: You knew it was coming. But it's a lot different when we changed the creator's intent.
Changing the music and the sound effects completely alter the emotional impact of that scene. And we can see it in our breath.
Suspense, fear, joy all show up as reproducible, visually identifiable moments. We broadcast a chemical signature of our emotions.
It is the end of the poker face.
Our spaces, our technology will know what we're feeling.
We will know more about each other than we ever have.
We get a chance to reach in and connect to the experience and sentiments that are fundamental to us as humans in our senses, emotionally and socially.
I believe it is the era of the empath.
If we recognize the power of becoming technological empaths, we get this opportunity where technology can help us bridge the emotional and cognitive divide.

(Applause)
If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?
But I always have to start my classes by dispelling some hardwired myths, because without really knowing it, many of us were taught evolution wrong.
For instance, we're taught to say "the theory of evolution.
" There are actually many theories, and just like the process itself, the ones that best fit the data are the ones that survive to this day.
The one we know best is Darwinian natural selection.
That's the process by which organisms that best fit an environment survive and get to reproduce, while those that are less fit slowly die off.
And that's it.
But they don't become us any more than we would become them.
Well, misunderstanding evolution has led to many problems, but you can't ask that age-old question, "Where are we from?
So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys, but we do share a common ancestor with them.
All the while, life around us kept evolving: more bacteria, more fungi, lots of fish, fish, fish. If you couldn't tell -- yes, they're my favorite group.
Perhaps it's better still to think of us as a little fish out of water.
(Applause)If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?
(Laughter) Well, because we're not monkeys, we're fish.
But I always have to start my classes by dispelling some hardwired myths, because without really knowing it, many of us were taught evolution wrong.
For instance, we're taught to say "the theory of evolution.
" There are actually many theories, and just like the process itself, the ones that best fit the data are the ones that survive to this day.
The one we know best is Darwinian natural selection.
That's the process by which organisms that best fit an environment survive and get to reproduce, while those that are less fit slowly die off.
And that's it.
Evolution is as simple as that, and it's a fact.
Evolution is a fact as much as the "theory of gravity. " You can prove it just as easily.
You just need to look at your bellybutton that you share with other placental mammals, or your backbone that you share with other vertebrates, or your DNA that you share with all other life on earth. Those traits didn't pop up in humans.
They were passed down from different ancestors to all their descendants, not just us.
But that's not really how we learn biology early on, is it?
We learn plants and bacteria are primitive things, and fish give rise to amphibians followed by reptiles and mammals, and then you get you, this perfectly evolved creature at the end of the line.
But life doesn't evolve in a line, and it doesn't end with us.
But we're always shown evolution portrayed something like this, a monkey and a chimpanzee, some extinct humans, all on a forward and steady march to becoming us.
But they don't become us any more than we would become them.
We're also not the goal of evolution.
But why does it matter?
Why do we need to understand evolution the right way?
Well, misunderstanding evolution has led to many problems, but you can't ask that age-old question, "Where are we from?
" without understanding evolution the right way.
Misunderstanding it has led to many convoluted and corrupted views of how we should treat other life on earth, and how we should treat each other in terms of race and gender.
So let's go back four billion years.
This is the single-celled organism we all came from.
At first, it gave rise to other single-celled life, but these are still evolving to this day, and some would say the Archaea and Bacteria that make up most of this group is the most successful on the planet.
They are certainly going to be here well after us. About three billion years ago, multicellularity evolved.
This includes your fungi and your plants and your animals.
The first animals to develop a backbone were fishes. So technically, all vertebrates are fishes, so technically, you and I are fish.
So don't say I didn't warn you.
One fish lineage came onto land and gave rise to, among other things, the mammals and reptiles.
Some reptiles become birds, some mammals become primates, some primates become monkeys with tails, and others become the great apes, including a variety of human species.
So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys, but we do share a common ancestor with them.
All the while, life around us kept evolving: more bacteria, more fungi, lots of fish, fish, fish. If you couldn't tell -- yes, they're my favorite group.
(Laughter) As life evolves, it also goes extinct.
Most species just last for a few million years. So you see, most life on earth that we see around us today are about the same age as our species.
So it's hubris, it's self-centered to think, "Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive, and we've been here for an evolutionary minute, so we're somehow special.
" Think of life as being this book, an unfinished book for sure.
We're just seeing the last few pages of each chapter.
If you look out on the eight million species that we share this planet with, think of them all being four billion years of evolution. They're all the product of that.
Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life, all of us connected by invisible branches not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors.
As a biologist, I'm still trying to learn, with others, how everyone's related to each other, who is related to whom.
Perhaps it's better still to think of us as a little fish out of water.
Yes, one that learned to walk and talk, but one that still has a lot of learning to do about who we are and where we came from.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to tell you guys something about neuroscience. I'm a physicist by training.
About three years ago, I left physics to come and try to understand how the brain works.
And this is what I found.
Lots of people are working on depression.
And that's really good, depression is something that we really want to understand.
And the mouse swims around for a little while and then at some point, the mouse gets tired and decides to stop swimming.
OK?
Lots of people want to understand emotion.
But you can't study emotion in mice or monkeys because you can't ask them how they're feeling or what they're experiencing.
And yet there have been almost no significant improvements in outcomes for patients with brain diseases in the past 40 years.
Well, to start with, the climate is a bit warmer that what you're used to.
But actually, in the year 2100 most things are surprisingly recognizable.
It's just the brain is totally different.
For example, in the year 2100, we understand the root causes of Alzheimer's.
So we can deliver targeted genetic therapies or drugs to stop the degenerative process before it begins.
So how did we do it?
Well, there were essentially three steps.
The first step was that we had to figure out some way to get electrical connections through the skull so we could measure the electrical activity of neurons.
And not only that, it had to be easy and risk-free.
Something that basically anyone would be OK with, like getting a piercing. Because back in 2017, the only way that we knew of to get through the skull was to drill these holes the size of quarters. You would never let someone do that to you.
So in the 2020s, people began to experiment -- rather than drilling these gigantic holes, drilling microscopic holes, no thicker than a piece of hair.
In the end, it would be like getting a shot.
You just go in and you sit down and there's a thing that comes down on your head, and a momentary sting and then it's done, and you can go back about your day.
So we're eventually able to do it using lasers to drill the holes.
OK?
So the next step, that happened in the 2030s, was that it's not just about getting through the skull.
To measure the activity of neurons, you have to actually make it into the brain tissue itself.
And the risk, whenever you put something into the brain tissue, is essentially that of stroke.
That you would hit a blood vessel and burst it, and that causes a stroke.
So, by the mid 2030s, we had invented these flexible probes that were capable of going around blood vessels, rather than through them.
And thus, we could put huge batteries of these probes into the brains of patients and record from thousands of their neurons without any risk to them.
And what we discovered, sort of to our surprise, is that the neurons that we could identify were not responding to things like ideas or emotion, which was what we had expected.
They were mostly responding to things like Jennifer Aniston or Halle Berry or Justin Trudeau.
I mean -- (Laughter) In hindsight, we shouldn't have been that surprised.
I mean, what do your neurons spend most of their time thinking about?
(Laughter) But really, the point is that this technology enabled us to begin studying neuroscience in individuals.
So much like the transition to genetics, at the single cell level, we started to study neuroscience, at the single human level.
But we weren't quite there yet.
Because these technologies were still restricted to medical applications, which meant that we were studying sick brains, not healthy brains.
Because no matter how safe your technology is, you can't stick something into someone's brain for research purposes.
They have to want it.
And why would they want it?
Because as soon as you have an electrical connection to the brain, you can use it to hook the brain up to a computer.
Oh, well, you know, the general public was very skeptical at first.
I mean, who wants to hook their brain up to their computers?
Well just imagine being able to send an email with a thought.
(Laughter) Imagine being able to take a picture with your eyes, OK? (Laughter) Imagine never forgetting anything anymore, because anything that you choose to remember will be stored permanently on a hard drive somewhere, able to be recalled at will.
(Laughter) The line here between crazy and visionary was never quite clear.
But the systems were safe.
So when the FDA decided to deregulate these laser-drilling systems, in 2043, commercial demand just exploded.
People started signing their emails, "Please excuse any typos. Sent from my brain.
" (Laughter) Commercial systems popped up left and right, offering the latest and greatest in neural interfacing technology.
There were 100 electrodes.
A thousand electrodes.
High bandwidth for only 99.99 a month.
(Laughter) Soon, everyone had them.
And that was the key.
Because, in the 2050s, if you were a neuroscientist, you could have someone come into your lab essentially from off the street. And you could have them engaged in some emotional task or social behavior or abstract reasoning, things you could never study in mice.
And you could record the activity of their neurons using the interfaces that they already had.
And then you could also ask them about what they were experiencing.
So this link between psychology and neuroscience that you could never make in the animals, was suddenly there.
So perhaps the classic example of this was the discovery of the neural basis for insight.
That "Aha!
" moment, the moment it all comes together, it clicks.
Right there.
That is understanding.
So finally, we were able to get at the things that make us human.
And that's what really opened the way to major insights from medicine.
So for example, in the case of ADHD, we discovered that there are dozens of different diseases, all of which had been called ADHD at the start of the century, that actually had nothing to do with each other, except that they had similar symptoms.
And they needed to be treated in different ways.
So it was kind of incredible, in retrospect, that at the beginning of the century, we had been treating all those different diseases with the same drug, just by giving people amphetamine, basically is what we were doing. 
And schizophrenia and depression are the same way.
And some of it is.
I mean, I can't actually see into the future.
And almost no one is working on figuring out how to do that today.
That is the future of neuroscience.
And I think it's time for neuroscientists to put down the mouse brain and to dedicate the thought and investment necessary to understand the human brain and human disease.
Thank you.
(Applause)I want to tell you guys something about neuroscience. I'm a physicist by training.
About three years ago, I left physics to come and try to understand how the brain works.
And this is what I found.
Lots of people are working on depression.
And that's really good, depression is something that we really want to understand.
Here's how you do it: you take a jar and you fill it up, about halfway, with water. And then you take a mouse, and you put the mouse in the jar, OK?
And the mouse swims around for a little while and then at some point, the mouse gets tired and decides to stop swimming.
And when it stops swimming, that's depression.
OK?
And I'm from theoretical physics, so I'm used to people making very sophisticated mathematical models to precisely describe physical phenomena, so when I saw that this is the model for depression, I though to myself, "Oh my God, we have a lot of work to do.
" (Laughter) But this is a kind of general problem in neuroscience. So for example, take emotion.
Lots of people want to understand emotion.
But you can't study emotion in mice or monkeys because you can't ask them how they're feeling or what they're experiencing.
So instead, people who want to understand emotion, typically end up studying what's called motivated behavior, which is code for "what the mouse does when it really, really wants cheese.
" OK, I could go on and on. 
I mean, the point is, the NIH spends about 5.5 billion dollars a year on neuroscience research.
And yet there have been almost no significant improvements in outcomes for patients with brain diseases in the past 40 years.
And I think a lot of that is basically due to the fact that mice might be OK as a model for cancer or diabetes, but the mouse brain is just not sophisticated enough to reproduce human psychology or human brain disease.
OK?
So if the mouse models are so bad, why are we still using them?
Well, it basically boils down to this: the brain is made up of neurons which are these little cells that send electrical signals to each other.
If you want to understand how the brain works, you have to be able to measure the electrical activity of these neurons.
But to do that, you have to get really close to the neurons with some kind of electrical recording device or a microscope.
And so you can do that in mice and you can do it in monkeys, because you can physically put things into their brain but for some reason we still can't do that in humans, OK?
So instead, we've invented all these proxies. 
So the most popular one is probably this, functional MRI, fMRI, which allows you to make these pretty pictures like this, that show which parts of your brain light up when you're engaged in different activities.
But this is a proxy.
You're not actually measuring neural activity here.
What you're doing is you're measuring, essentially, like, blood flow in the brain.
Where there's more blood.
It's actually where there's more oxygen, but you get the idea, OK?
The other thing that you can do is you can do this -- electroencephalography -- you can put these electrodes on your head, OK? And then you can measure your brain waves.
And here, you're actually measuring electrical activity. But you're not measuring the activity of neurons.
You're measuring these electrical currents, sloshing back and forth in your brain.
So the point is just that these technologies that we have are really measuring the wrong thing.
Because, for most of the diseases that we want to understand -- like, Parkinson's is the classic example.
In Parkinson's, there's one particular kind of neuron deep in your brain that is responsible for the disease, and these technologies just don't have the resolution that you need to get at that.
And so that's why we're still stuck with the animals.
Not that anyone wants to be studying depression by putting mice into jars, right?
It's just that there's this pervasive sense that it's not possible to look at the activity of neurons in healthy humans.
So here's what I want to do.
I want to take you into the future.
To have a look at one way in which I think it could potentially be possible.
And I want to preface this by saying, I don't have all the details.
So I'm just going to provide you with a kind of outline.
But we're going to go the year 2100. Now what does the year 2100 look like?
Well, to start with, the climate is a bit warmer that what you're used to.
(Laughter) And that robotic vacuum cleaner that you know and love went through a few generations, and the improvements were not always so good.
(Laughter) It was not always for the better.
But actually, in the year 2100 most things are surprisingly recognizable.
It's just the brain is totally different.
For example, in the year 2100, we understand the root causes of Alzheimer's.
So how did we do it?
Well, there were essentially three steps.
And not only that, it had to be easy and risk-free.
So in the 2020s, people began to experiment -- rather than drilling these gigantic holes, drilling microscopic holes, no thicker than a piece of hair.
You just go in and you sit down and there's a thing that comes down on your head, and a momentary sting and then it's done, and you can go back about your day.
So we're eventually able to do it using lasers to drill the holes.
OK?
And the risk, whenever you put something into the brain tissue, is essentially that of stroke.
That you would hit a blood vessel and burst it, and that causes a stroke.
And what we discovered, sort of to our surprise, is that the neurons that we could identify were not responding to things like ideas or emotion, which was what we had expected.
I mean, what do your neurons spend most of their time thinking about?
Because these technologies were still restricted to medical applications, which meant that we were studying sick brains, not healthy brains.
(Laughter) Soon, everyone had them.
So perhaps the classic example of this was the discovery of the neural basis for insight.
Right there.
And that's what really opened the way to major insights from medicine.
And some of it is.
It was called, "You May Want to Marry My Husband.
Amy quite literally left an empty space for me to fill with another love story.
Amy was a prolific author.
Her doctors told us we could do hospice at home or in the hospital.
Each told beautiful stories of Amy and of us.
I want to get a little personal here and tell you that to this date, I have memories of those final weeks that haunt me.
I remember walking backwards to the bathroom, assisting Amy with each step.
I felt so strong.
I'm not such a big guy, but my arms looked and felt so healthy compared to Amy's frail body.
And that body failed in our house.
On March 13 of last year, my wife died of ovarian cancer in our bed.
I carried her lifeless body down our stairs, through our dining room and our living room to a waiting gurney to have her body cremated.
I will never get that image out of my head.
If you know someone who has been through the hospice experience, acknowledge that.
Just say you heard this guy Jason talk about how tough it must be to have those memories and that you're there if they ever want to talk about it.
They may not want to talk, but it's nice to connect with someone living each day with those lasting images.
I know this sounds unbelievable, but I've never been asked that question.
Amy's essay caused me to experience grief in a public way.
Many of the readers who reached out to me wrote beautiful words of reflection.
The scope of Amy's impact was deeper and richer than even us and her family knew.
Some of the responses I received helped me with the intense grieving process because of their humor, like this email I received from a woman reader who read the article, declaring, "I will marry you when you are ready -- (Laughter) "provided you permanently stop drinking.
No other conditions.
I promise to outlive you.
Thank you very much.
" Now, I do like a good tequila, but that really is not my issue.
Yet how could I say no to that proposal?
(Laughter) I laughed through the tears when I read this note from a family friend: "I remember Shabbat dinners at your home and Amy teaching me how to make cornbread croutons. Only Amy could find creativity in croutons.
" (Laughter) On July 27, just a few months after Amy's death, my dad died of complications related to a decades-long battle with Parkinson's disease.
I had to wonder: How much can the human condition handle?
What makes us capable of dealing with this intense loss and yet carry on?
Was this a test?
Why my family and my amazing children?
Looking for answers, I regret to say, is a lifelong mission, but the key to my being able to persevere is Amy's expressed and very public edict that I must go on.
Throughout this year, I have done just that.
I have attempted to step out and seek the joy and the beauty that I know this life is capable of providing.
But here's the reality: those family gatherings, attending weddings and events honoring Amy, as loving as they are, have all been very difficult to endure.
People say I'm amazing. "How do you handle yourself that way during those times?
" They say, "You do it with such grace.
" Well, guess what?
I really am sad a lot of the time.
I often feel like I'm kind of a mess, and I know these feelings apply to other surviving spouses, children, parents and other family members.
In Japanese Zen, there is a term "Shoji," which translates as "birth death.
" There is no separation between life and death other than a thin line that connects the two.
Birth, or the joyous, wonderful, vital parts of life, and death, those things we want to get rid of, are said to be faced equally.
In this new life that I find myself in, I am doing my best to embrace this concept as I move forward with grieving.
In the early months following Amy's death, though, I was sure that the feeling of despair would be ever-present, that it would be all-consuming.
Soon I was fortunate to receive some promising advice.
Many members of the losing-a-spouse club reached out to me.
One friend in particular who had also lost her life partner kept repeating, "Jason, you will find joy.
" I didn't even know what she was talking about.
How was that possible?
But because Amy gave me very public permission to also find happiness, I now have experienced joy from time to time.
There it was, dancing the night away at an LCD Soundsystem concert, traveling with my brother and best friend or with a college buddy on a boys' trip to meet a group of great guys I never met before.
From observing that my deck had sun beating down on it on a cold day, stepping out in it, laying there, the warmth consuming my body.
The joy comes from my three stunning children.
There was my son Justin, texting me a picture of himself with an older gentleman with a massive, strong forearm and the caption, "I just met Popeye," with a huge grin on his face.
(Laughter) There was his brother Miles, walking to the train for his first day of work after graduating college, who stopped and looked back at me and asked, "What am I forgetting?
" I assured him right away, "You are 100 percent ready.
You got this. " And my daughter Paris, walking together through Battersea Park in London, the leaves piled high, the sun glistening in the early morning on our way to yoga.
I would add that beauty is also there to discover, and I mean beauty of the wabi-sabi variety but beauty nonetheless.
On the one hand, when I see something in this category, I want to say, "Amy, did you see that?
Did you hear that?
It's too beautiful for you not to share with me. " On the other hand, I now experience these moments in an entirely new way.
There was the beauty I found in music, like the moment in the newest Manchester Orchestra album, when the song "The Alien" seamlessly transitions into "The Sunshine," or the haunting beauty of Luke Sital-Singh's "Killing Me," whose chorus reads, "And it's killing me that you're not here with me.
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty.
Listen, I want to make it clear that I'm a very fortunate person.
I have the most amazing family that loves and supports me.
I have the resources for personal growth during my time of grief.
But whether it's a divorce, losing a job you worked so hard at or having a family member die suddenly or of a slow-moving and painful death, I would like to offer you what I was given: a blank of sheet of paper.
What will you do with your intentional empty space, with your fresh start?
Thank you.
(Applause)There are three words that explain why I am here.
They are "Amy Krouse Rosenthal.
" At the end of Amy's life, hyped up on morphine and home in hospice, the "New York Times" published an article she wrote for the "Modern Love" column on March 3, 2017. It was read worldwide by over five million people.
The piece was unbearably sad, ironically funny and brutally honest.
While it was certainly about our life together, the focus of the piece was me.
It was called, "You May Want to Marry My Husband.
" It was a creative play on a personal ad for me.
Amy quite literally left an empty space for me to fill with another love story.
Amy was my wife for half my life.
She was my partner in raising three wonderful, now grown children, and really, she was my girl, you know?
We had so much in common.
We loved the same art, the same documentaries, the same music.
Music was a huge part of our life together.
And we shared the same values.
We were in love, and our love grew stronger up until her last day.
Amy was a prolific author.
In addition to two groundbreaking memoirs, she published over 30 children's books.
Posthumously, the book she wrote with our daughter Paris, called "Dear Girl," reached the number one position on the "New York Times" bestseller list.
She was a self-described tiny filmmaker. She was 5'1" and her films were not that long. (Laughter) Her films exemplified her natural ability to gather people together.
She was also a terrific public speaker, talking with children and adults of all ages all over the world.
Now, my story of grief is only unique in the sense of it being rather public.
However, the grieving process itself was not my story alone.
Amy gave me permission to move forward, and I'm so grateful for that.
Now, just a little over a year into my new life, I've learned a few things.
I'm here to share with you part of the process of moving forward through and with grief.
But before I do that, I think it would be important to talk a little bit about the end of life, because it forms how I have been emotionally since then.
Death is such a taboo subject, right? Amy ate her last meal on January 9, 2017. She somehow lived an additional two months without solid food.
Her doctors told us we could do hospice at home or in the hospital.
They did not tell us that Amy would shrink to half her body weight, that she would never lay with her husband again, and that walking upstairs to our bedroom would soon feel like running a marathon.
Home hospice does have an aura of being a beautiful environment to die in.
How great that you don't have the sounds of machines beeping and going on and off all the time, no disruptions for mandatory drug administration, home with your family to die.
We did our best to make those weeks as meaningful as we could.
We talked often about death.
Everybody knows it's going to happen to them, like, for sure, but being able to talk openly about it was liberating.
We talked about subjects like parenting.
I asked Amy how I could be the best parent possible to our children in her absence.
In those conversations, she gave me confidence by stressing what a great relationship I had with each one of them, and that I can do it.
I know there will be many times where I wish she and I can make decisions together.
We were always so in sync.
May I be so audacious as to suggest that you have these conversations now, when healthy.
Please don't wait.
As part of our hospice experience, we organized groups of visitors.
How brave of Amy to receive them, even as she began her physical decline.
We had a Krouse night, her parents and three siblings.
Friends and family were next.
Each told beautiful stories of Amy and of us.
Amy made an immense impact on her loyal friends.
But home hospice is not so beautiful for the surviving family members.
I want to get a little personal here and tell you that to this date, I have memories of those final weeks that haunt me.
I felt so strong.
I'm not such a big guy, but my arms looked and felt so healthy compared to Amy's frail body.
And that body failed in our house.
I carried her lifeless body down our stairs, through our dining room and our living room to a waiting gurney to have her body cremated.
I will never get that image out of my head.
If you know someone who has been through the hospice experience, acknowledge that.
Just say you heard this guy Jason talk about how tough it must be to have those memories and that you're there if they ever want to talk about it.

" Now, I do like a good tequila, but that really is not my issue.
Yet how could I say no to that proposal?
" (Laughter) On July 27, just a few months after Amy's death, my dad died of complications related to a decades-long battle with Parkinson's disease.
What makes us capable of dealing with this intense loss and yet carry on?
Was this a test?
Why my family and my amazing children?
Throughout this year, I have done just that.
But here's the reality: those family gatherings, attending weddings and events honoring Amy, as loving as they are, have all been very difficult to endure.

(Applause)
Why? In some cases, it's because they're bad or unethical, but often, they've taken us to the wrong objectives.
This has to stop. How are we going to correct these wrongs?
Execution is what matters the most.
" And so Andy invented a system called "Objectives and Key Results. " It kind of rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
The key results have to be measured, but at the end you can look and without any argument say, "Did I do that, or did I not do that?
They ship their sales, they introduce their new products, they make their numbers, but they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams.
Because truly transformational teams combine their ambitions to their passion and to their purpose, and they develop a clear and compelling sense of why. I want to tell you a story.
Nuna is a health care data company.
Why?
And when he was seven, he had his first grand mal seizure at Disneyland. He fell to the ground. He stopped breathing.
That moment defined her mission, and that mission became her company, and that company bid on, won and delivered on that contract.
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.
Remember, that's what we want to have accomplished.
And objectives are significant, they're action-oriented, they are inspiring, and they're a kind of vaccine against fuzzy thinking.
The next is universal access to anti-HIV drugs.
Now, why are these good objectives?
Let's go back to our checklist.
Significant? Check. Concrete?
Yes. Action-oriented?
Yes. Inspirational?
Well, let's just listen to Bono.
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?
How passionate?
What actions does your passion lead you to do?
If the heart doesn't find a perfect rhyme with the head, then your passion means nothing.
The OKR framework cultivates the madness, the chemistry contained inside it.
It gives us an environment for risk, for trust, where failing is not a fireable offense.
And when you have that sort of structure and environment and the right people, magic is around the corner.
JD: I love that.
OKRs cultivate the madness, and magic is right around the corner.
This is perfect.
So with Jini we've covered the whys, with Bono the whats of goal-setting.
Let's turn our attention to the hows.
Remember, the hows are the key results.
That's how we meet our objectives.
And good results are specific and time-bound.
They're aggressive but realistic.
They're measurable, and they're verifiable.
Those are good key results.
In 1999, I introduced OKRs to Google's cofounders, Larry and Sergey.
Here they are, 24 years old in their garage.
And Sergey enthusiastically said he'd adopt them.
Well, not quite.
What he really said was, "We don't have any other way to manage this company, so we'll give it a go. " (Laughter) And I took that as a kind of endorsement.
But every quarter since then, every Googler has written down her objectives and her key results. They've graded them, and they've published them for everyone to see.
And these are not used for bonuses or for promotions.
They're set aside.
Somewhat better.In the third year, he upped the ante once more to a hundred million.He launched an aggressive marketing campaign, broader distribution, improved the technology, and kaboom!He got 111 million users.
Here's why I like this story, not so much for the happy ending, but it shows someone carefully choosing the right objective and then sticking to it year after year after year. It's a perfect story for a nerd like me.
Now, I think of OKRs as transparent vessels that are made from the whats and hows of our ambitions. What really matters is the why that we pour into those vessels. That's why we do our work.
Why? In some cases, it's because they're bad or unethical, but often, they've taken us to the wrong objectives.
And this is unacceptable.
This has to stop. How are we going to correct these wrongs?
How are we going to choose the right course?
It's not going to be easy.
For years, I've worked with talented teams and they've chosen the right objectives and the wrong objectives. Many have succeeded, others of them have failed.
And today I'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- that's what's crucial, how and why they set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons.
Let's go back to 1975. Yep, this is me.
I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, who's been called the greatest manager of his or any other era.
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher, and he said to me, "John, it almost doesn't matter what you know.
Execution is what matters the most.
" And so Andy invented a system called "Objectives and Key Results. " It kind of rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
And it's all about excellent execution.
So here's a classic video from the 1970s of professor Andy Grove. (Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases of the management by objective systems are the objectives and the key results, and they match the two purposes.
The objective is the direction.
The key results have to be measured, but at the end you can look and without any argument say, "Did I do that, or did I not do that?
" Yes. No. Simple. John Doerr: That's Andy.
Yes. No. Simple. Objectives and Key Results, or OKRs, are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations, they work for teams, they even work for individuals.
The objectives are what you want to have accomplished.
The key results are how I'm going to get that done. Objectives. Key results. What and how.
But here's the truth: many of us are setting goals wrong, and most of us are not setting goals at all.
A lot of organizations set objectives and meet them.
They ship their sales, they introduce their new products, they make their numbers, but they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams.
So how do you set these goals the right way?
First, you must answer the question, "Why?
" Why?
Because truly transformational teams combine their ambitions to their passion and to their purpose, and they develop a clear and compelling sense of why. I want to tell you a story.
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur.
Her name is Jini Kim.
She runs a company called Nuna.
Nuna is a health care data company.
Nuna at the time was just 15 people and this database had to be built in one year, and they had a whole set of commitments that they had to honor, and frankly, they weren't going to make very much money on the project.
This was a bet-your-company moment, and Jini seized it.
She jumped at the opportunity. She did not flinch.
Why?
Well, it's a personal why.
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism.
And when he was seven, he had his first grand mal seizure at Disneyland. He fell to the ground. He stopped breathing.
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants.
They came to the country with limited resources speaking little English, so it was up to Jini to enroll her family in Medicaid.
She was nine years old.
That moment defined her mission, and that mission became her company, and that company bid on, won and delivered on that contract.
Here's Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid saved my family from bankruptcy, and today it provides for Kimong's health and for millions of others.
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.
Every row of data is a life whose story deserves to be told with dignity.
JD: And Jini's story tells us that a compelling sense of why can be the launchpad for our objectives.
Remember, that's what we want to have accomplished.
And objectives are significant, they're action-oriented, they are inspiring, and they're a kind of vaccine against fuzzy thinking.
The next is universal access to anti-HIV drugs.
Now, why are these good objectives?
Let's go back to our checklist.
Yes. Action-oriented?
Yes. Inspirational?
Well, let's just listen to Bono.
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?
How passionate?
What actions does your passion lead you to do?
The OKR framework cultivates the madness, the chemistry contained inside it.
And when you have that sort of structure and environment and the right people, magic is around the corner.
JD: I love that.
OKRs cultivate the madness, and magic is right around the corner.
So with Jini we've covered the whys, with Bono the whats of goal-setting.
Let's turn our attention to the hows.
That's how we meet our objectives.
They're measurable, and they're verifiable.
Those are good key results.
In 1999, I introduced OKRs to Google's cofounders, Larry and Sergey.

Here's why I like this story, not so much for the happy ending, but it shows someone carefully choosing the right objective and then sticking to it year after year after year. It's a perfect story for a nerd like me.
This has always been an important question.
Humans have been asking themselves this question ever since we lived in organized societies.
Along here, we're going to put the last 200 years.
So I'm going to ask you two questions, and I want you to put your hands up if you agree.
And that's the second question.
Our politics is broken, our politicians aren't trusted, and the political system is distorted by powerful vested interests.
Let's elect a populist demagogue who will ignore democratic norms, trample on liberal freedoms and just get things done.
I want you to ask yourselves, "Why wouldn't this work?
" And then come and talk to me afterwards about it.
" But its common name is "random selection.
" And the idea is actually very simple: we randomly select people and put them in parliament.
(Laughter) Let's think about that for a few more minutes, shall we?
Imagine we chose you and you and you and you and you down there and a bunch of other random people, and we put you in our parliament for the next couple of years.
Of course, we could stratify the selection to make sure that it matched the socioeconomic and demographic profile of the country and was a truly representative sample of people. Fifty percent of them would be women.
And this microcosm would simulate how we would all think, if we had the time, the information and a good process to come to the moral crux of political decisions.
And although you may not be in that group, someone of your age, someone of your gender, someone from your location and someone with your background would be in that room.
The decisions made by these people would build on the wisdom of crowds.
They would become more than the sum of their parts.
They would become critical thinkers with access to experts, who would be on tap but not on top.
And they could prove that diversity can trump ability when confronting the wide array of societal questions and problems.
It would not be government by public opinion poll. It would not be government by referendum.
These informed, deliberating people would move beyond public opinion to the making of public judgments.
However, there would be one major side effect: if we replaced elections with sortition and made our parliament truly representative of society, it would mean the end of politicians.
And I'm sure we'd all be pretty sad to see that.
(Laughter) Very interestingly, random selection was a key part of how democracy was done in ancient Athens.
This machine, this device, is called a kleroteria.
It's an ancient Athenian random-selection device.
The ancient Athenians randomly selected citizens to fill the vast majority of their political posts.
They knew that elections were aristocratic devices.
They knew that career politicians were a thing to be avoided.
And I think we know these things as well.
But more interesting than the ancient use of random selection is its modern resurgence.
The rediscovery of the legitimacy of random selection in politics has become so common lately, that there's simply too many examples to talk about.
Of course, I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to institute this in our parliaments.
Try this -- say to your friend, "I think we should populate our parliament with randomly selected people.
" "Are you joking?
What if my neighbor gets chosen?
The fool can't even separate his recycling.
" But the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is that it does work.
If you give people responsibility, they act responsibly.
Don't get me wrong -- it's not a panacea.
The question is not: Would this be perfect?
Of course not.
People are fallibly human, and distorting influences will continue to exist.
The question is: Would it be better?
And the answer to that question, to me at least, is obviously yes.
Which gets us back to our original question: How should we live together?
And now we have an answer: with a parliament that uses sortition.
But how would we get from here to there?
How could we fix our broken system and remake democracy for the 21st century?
Well, there are several things that we can do, and that are, in fact, happening right now. We can experiment with sortition.
Perhaps the first step would be a second chamber in our parliament, full of randomly selected people -- a citizens' senate, if you will.
There's a campaign for a citizens' senate in France and another campaign in Scotland, and it could, of course, be done right here in Hungary.
That would be kind of like a Trojan horse right into the heart of government.
And then, when it becomes impossible to patch over the cracks in the current system, we must step up and replace elections with sortition.
I have hope.
Here in Hungary, systems have been created, and systems have been torn down and replaced in the past.
Change can and does happen.
It's just a matter of when and how.
Thank you.
(Hungarian) Thank you.
(Applause)
At age four, I found a garden, living underneath the kitchen floor.
It was hiding behind leftover patches of linoleum on the worn-out floor my mother was having removed.
The workman was busy when the garden caught my attention.
My eyes became glued to the patterns of embroidered roses blooming across my childhood landscape.
I saw them and felt a sense of joy and adventure.
This excitement felt like a feeling to go forward into something I knew nothing about.
My passion and connection to garden started at that exact moment.
When spring arrived, I ran so fast through the house, speeding ahead of my mother's voice.
I pulled on my red corduroy jumper and my grey plaid wool hat before my mother could get her jacket on. I catapulted out of the front screen door and threw myself on a fresh carpet of grass.
In our last conversation before her death, she encouraged me to go anywhere in the world that would make me happy.
Since then, I have planted her gardens through art installations throughout the world, in countries of the people that I meet. Now they are lining parks and courtyards, painted on walls and even in blighted lots off the street.
If you were in Berlin, Germany, you would have seen my garden at Stilwerk Design Center, where rosemary and lavender, hydrangea and lemon balm trailed up the glass elevators to all six floors.
In 2009, I planted "Philosophers Garden," a garden mural, blooming at the historic Frederick Douglass High School in Memphis, Tennessee.
This school’s garden fed an entire community and was honored by Eleanor Roosevelt during the Great Depression.
Again, in 2011, I planted at Court Square Park -- six entry gardens with 80 varieties of deliciously fragrant floribunda and hybrid tea roses.
Gardening has taught me that planting and growing a garden is the same process as creating our lives.
This process of creation begins in the spring, when you break up the soil and start anew.
Then it's time to clear out the dead leaves, debris and roots of the winter.
The gardener must then make sure that a good disposition and the proper nutrients are correctly mixed in the soil.
Then it's important to aerate the topsoil and leave it loosely packed on the surface.
You won't get those beautiful blooms in life until you first do the work just right.
When our gardens are balanced with care, we can harvest the beauty of living a life of grace.
In the forests, when trees realize through their roots that another tree is sick, they will send a portion of their nutrients to that tree to help them to heal.
They never think about what will happen to them or feel vulnerable when they do.
When a tree is dying, it releases all of its nutrients to other trees that need it the most.
Below the surface, we are all connected by our roots and sharing nutrients with each other.
It's only when we come together that we can honestly grow.
It's the same for humans in the garden of hardship.
In this garden, when the caterpillar transforms into a chrysalis, this involves some struggle.
But it's a challenge with a purpose.
Without this painful fight to break free from the confines of the cocoon, the newly formed butterfly can't strengthen its wings.
Without the battle, the butterfly dies without ever taking flight.
My life's work is to illustrate how to integrate human connectivity into the garden.
Gardens are full of magical wisdom for this transformation.
Mother Nature is creative energy waiting to be born.
Gardens are a mirror that cast their own reflection into our waking lives.
So nurture your talents and strengths while you appreciate all you've been given.
Remain humble to healing.
And maintain compassion for others.
Cultivate your garden for giving and plant those seeds for the future.
The garden is the world living deep inside of you.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Cheers) (Applause)
Ever since I was a young girl, I was always fascinated -- (Laughter) Oh!
(Laughter) OK, I meant younger and more short. (Laughter) If that's possible to imagine.
And without one, the others have little or no value.
So, inspired by Marie Curie and my local science museum, I decided to start asking these questions myself and engage in my own independent research, whether it be out of my garage or my bedroom.
I started reading journal papers, started doing science competitions, started participating in science fairs, doing anything I could to get the knowledge that I so desperately wanted. So while I was studying anatomy for a competition, I came across the topic of something called chronic wounds.
And one thing that stood out to me was a statistic that said that the number of people in the United States with chronic wounds exceeds the number of people with breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and leukemia, combined.
Hold up.
So what is a chronic wound?
So more staggering statistics were to be found as I kept going on in this research.
In the year 2010 alone, 50 billion dollars were spent worldwide to treat chronic wounds.
In addition, it's estimated that about two percent of the population will get a chronic wound at some point in their lifetime. This was absurd.
So as I started doing more research, I found that there was a correlation between the moisture level inside a wound dressing and the stage of healing that the chronic wound would be at.
So I decided, why don't I design something to measure the moisture level within the wound so this can help doctors and patients treat their wounds better. And essentially, expedite the healing process.
So that's exactly what I set out to do. Being a 14-year-old working out of her garage-turned-lab, I had a lot of constraints. Most being that I wasn't given a grant, I wasn't given a lot of money, and I wasn't given a lot of resources.
In addition, I had a lot of criteria, as well. Since this product would be readily interacting with the body, it had to be biocompatible, it also had to be low-cost, as I was designing it and paying for it myself.
It also had to be mass-manufacturable, because I wanted it to be made anywhere, for anyone. Thus, I drafted up a schematic.
What you see on the left hand-side is the early schematics in my design, showing both a bird's-eye view and also one stacking variant.
A stacking variant means that the entire product is consisted of different individual parts that have to work in unison.
And what's shown there is one possible arrangement. So what exactly is this?
So I had gone on to testing my sensors and as all scientists have stumbles along their work, I also had a couple of problems in my first generation of sensors.
First of all, I couldn't figure out how to get a nanoparticle ink into a printcheck cartridge without spilling it all over my carpet. That was problem number one.
Problem number two was, I couldn't exactly control the sensitivity of my sensors. I couldn't scale them up or down, I couldn't really do anything of that sort.
So I wanted something to solve it.
Problem one was easily solved by some scouting on eBay and Amazon for syringes that I could use.
Problem two, however, required a lot more thought.
So this is where this factors in.
Lastly, I had to connect this data in order to be read.So I interfaced it with a Bluetooth chip, which you can see here by the app screenshots on the right.
And what this does is that anyone can monitor the progress of their wound, and it can be transmitted over a wireless connection to the doctor, the patient or whoever needs it.
[Continued Testing and Refinement] So in conclusion, my design was successful -- however, science never ends.
There's always something to be done, something to be refined.
So that's what I'm currently in the process of doing.
And that's what inspired me to keep going, and I hope it inspires many others to also do work like this even though they're not very sure about it.
So I hope that's a message that you all take on today.
Thank you. (Applause)
I became a voracious comic book reader, but I never brought them to school.
Instinctively, I knew that comic books didn't belong in the classroom.
My parents definitely were not fans, and I was certain that my teachers wouldn't be either.
After all, they never used them to teach, comic books and graphic novels were never allowed during silent sustained reading, and they were never sold at our annual book fair.
Even so, I kept reading comics, and I even started making them. Eventually I became a published cartoonist, writing and drawing comic books for a living.
I also became a high school teacher.
This is where I taught: Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland, California.
I taught a little bit of math and a little bit of art, but mostly computer science, and I was there for 17 years.
(Laughter) I was wrong.
This was the '90s, so comic books didn't have the cultural cachet that they do today. My students didn't think I was cool.
They thought I was kind of a dork.
And even worse, when stuff got hard in my class, they would use comic books as a way of distracting me.
They would raise their hands and ask me questions like, "Mr. Yang, who do you think would win in a fight, Superman or the Hulk?
" (Laughter) I very quickly realized I had to keep my teaching and my cartooning separate.
It seemed like my instincts in fifth grade were correct.
Comic books didn't belong in the classroom.
But again, I was wrong.
A few years into my teaching career, I learned firsthand the educational potential of comics.
One semester, I was asked to sub for this Algebra 2 class.
I was asked to long-term sub it, and I said yes, but there was a problem.
At the time, I was also the school's educational technologist, which meant every couple of weeks I had to miss one or two periods of this Algebra 2 class because I was in another classroom helping another teacher with a computer-related activity.
For these Algebra 2 students, that was terrible.
I mean, having a long-term sub is bad enough, but having a sub for your sub? That's the worst.
In an effort to provide some sort of consistency for my students, I began videotaping myself giving lectures.
I'd then give these videos to my sub to play for my students.
I tried to make these videos as engaging as possible.
I even included these little special effects.
For instance, after I finished a problem on the board, I'd clap my hands, and the board would magically erase.
(Laughter) I thought it was pretty awesome.
I was pretty certain that my students would love it, but I was wrong.
(Laughter) These video lectures were a disaster.
I had students coming up to me and saying things like, "Mr. Yang, we thought you were boring in person, but on video, you are just unbearable.
" (Laughter) So as a desperate second attempt, I began drawing these lectures as comics.
I'd do these very quickly with very little planning.
I'd just take a sharpie, draw one panel after the other, figuring out what I wanted to say as I went. These comics lectures would come out to anywhere between four and six pages long, I'd xerox these, give them to my sub to hand to my students.
And much to my surprise, these comics lectures were a hit.
My students would ask me to make these for them even when I could be there in person.
It was like they liked cartoon me more than actual me.
(Laughter) This surprised me, because my students are part of a generation that was raised on screens, so I thought for sure they would like learning from a screen better than learning from a page.
But when I talked to my students about why they liked these comics lectures so much, I began to understand the educational potential of comics.
First, unlike their math textbooks, these comics lectures taught visually.
Our students grow up in a visual culture, so they're used to taking in information that way.
But unlike other visual narratives, like film or television or animation or video, comics are what I call permanent.
In a comic, past, present and future all sit side by side on the same page.
This means that the rate of information flow is firmly in the hands of the reader.
When my students didn't understand something in my comics lecture, they could just reread that passage as quickly or as slowly as they needed.
It was like I was giving them a remote control over the information.
The same was not true of my video lectures, and it wasn't even true of my in-person lectures.
And I was so intrigued by this experience that I had with these comics lectures that I decided to focus my final master's project on comics.
I wanted to figure out why American educators have historically been so reluctant to use comic books in their classrooms.
Here's what I discovered.
Comic books first became a mass medium in the 1940s, with millions of copies selling every month, and educators back then took notice.
A lot of innovative teachers began bringing comics into their classrooms to experiment.
In 1944, the "Journal of Educational Sociology" even devoted an entire issue to this topic.
Things seemed to be progressing.
Teachers were starting to figure things out.
But then along comes this guy.
This is child psychologist Dr. Fredric Wertham, and in 1954, he wrote a book called "Seduction of the Innocent," where he argues that comic books cause juvenile delinquency.
(Laughter) He was wrong.
Now, Dr. Wertham was actually a pretty decent guy.
He spent most of his career working with juvenile delinquents, and in his work he noticed that most of his clients read comic books.
These hearings lasted for almost two months.
They ended inconclusively, but not before doing tremendous damage to the reputation of comic books in the eyes of the American public.
After this, respectable American educators all backed away, and they stayed away for decades.
It wasn't until the 1970s that a few brave souls started making their way back in.
And it really wasn't until pretty recently, maybe the last decade or so, that comics have seen more widespread acceptance among American educators.
Mr. Burns assigns a comics essay to his students every year.
By asking his students to process a prose novel using images, Mr. Burns asks them to think deeply not just about the story but also about how that story is told.
And Ms. Murrock uses my own "American Born Chinese" with her English 1 students.
For her, graphic novels are a great way of fulfilling a Common Core Standard.
The Standard states that students ought to be able to analyze how visual elements contribute to the meaning, tone and beauty of a text.
Over in the library, Ms. Counts has built a pretty impressive graphic novel collection for Bishop O'Dowd.
Inspired by this renewed interest from American educators, American cartoonists are now producing more explicitly educational content for the K-12 market than ever before.
A lot of this is directed at language arts, but more and more comics and graphic novels are starting to tackle math and science topics.
STEM comics graphics novels really are like this uncharted territory, ready to be explored.
America is finally waking up to the fact that comic books do not cause juvenile delinquency.
(Laughter) That they really do belong in every educator's toolkit.
There's no good reason to keep comic books and graphic novels out of K-12 education.
They teach visually, they give our students that remote control.
The educational potential is there just waiting to be tapped by creative people like you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music ends) (Applause) Thank you.

Imagine waking up to a stranger -- sometimes multiple strangers -- questioning your right to existence for something that you wrote online, waking up to an angry message, scared and worried for your safety.
Welcome to the world of cyberharassment.
The kind of harassment that women face in Pakistan is very serious and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes.
This kind of harassment keeps women from accessing the internet -- essentially, knowledge.
It's a form of oppression.
Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world, with 140 million people having access to mobile technologies, and 15 percent internet penetration.
And this number doesn't seem to go down with the rise of new technologies.
Pakistan is also the birthplace of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai.
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan.
" Let me say this very clearly: it's not honor; it's a cold-blooded murder.
I come from a very small village in Punjab, Pakistan, where women are not allowed to pursue their higher education.
The elders of my extended family didn't allow their women to pursue their higher education or their professional careers.
However, unlike the other male guardians of my family, my father was one who really supported my ambitions.
To get my law degree, of course, it was really difficult, and [there were] frowns of disapproval.
But in the end, I knew it's either me or them, and I chose myself.
(Applause) My family's traditions and expectations for a woman wouldn't allow me to own a mobile phone until I was married.
And even when I was married, this tool became a tool for my own surveillance.
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he really didn't approve of this and threw me out of his house, along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah.
And that was the time when I first asked myself, "Why?
Why are women not allowed to enjoy the same equal rights enshrined in our Constitution?
While the law states that a woman has the same equal access to the information, why is it always men -- brothers, fathers and husbands -- who are granting these rights to us, effectively making the law irrelevant?
" So I decided to take a step, instead of keep questioning these patriarchal structures and societal norms.
And I founded the Digital Rights Foundation in 2012 to address all the issues and women's experiences in online spaces and cyberharassment.
From lobbying for free and safe internet to convincing young women that access to the safe internet is their fundamental, basic, human right, I'm trying to play my part in igniting the spark to address the questions that have bothered me all these years.
With a hope in my heart, and to offer a solution to this menace, I started Pakistan's and the region's first cyberharassment help line in December 2016 -- (Applause) to extend my support to the women who do not know who to turn to when they face serious threats online.
I think of the women who do not have the necessary support to deal with the mental trauma when they feel unsafe in online spaces, and they go about their daily activities, thinking that there is a rape threat in their in-box.
Safe access to the internet is an access to knowledge, and knowledge is freedom.
When I fight for women's digital rights, I'm fighting for equality.
Thank you.
(Applause)

My name is Thandiswa Mazwai.
I am a wild woman, a rebel singer, a conduit.
My music is about memory and struggling between oppresion and freedom.
After over 20 years in South Africa we find ourselves as the black masses still suffering and fighting for our freedom and humanity.
This first song was called "Iyeza" which means "medicine.
" Medicine for our madness, medicine for our rage.
This song we're doing now is called "Zabalaza," and it means "rebel.
" I'd like to dedicate this to the valiant student movement in South Africa who came up with the #FeesMustFall.
(Applause) Rhodes Must Fall.
(Applause) But more importantly, the new vigor that has been brought into the feminist movement so patriarchy must fall.

This is an equipment graveyard. It's a typical final resting place for medical equipment from hospitals in Africa. Now, why is this?
In low-resource settings, the standard of care is often a midwife listening to the baby's heart rate through a horn.Now, this approach has been around for more than a century.
It's very much dependent on the skill and the experience of the midwife. Two young inventors from Uganda visited an antenatal clinic at a local hospital a few years ago, when they were students in information technology.
They noticed that quite often, the midwife was not able to hear any heart rate when trying to listen to it through this horn.
So they invented their own fetal heart rate monitor.
They adapted the horn and connected it to a smartphone.
An app on the smartphone records the heart rate, analyzes it and provides the midwife with a range of information on the status of the baby.
My colleague, Sudesh Sivarasu, invented a smart glove for people who have suffered from leprosy.
This puts them at risk of injury.
The glove has sensors to detect temperature and pressure and warn the user.
It effectively serves as an artificial sense of touch and prevents injury.
Sudesh invented this glove after observing former leprosy patients as they carried out their day-to-day activities, and he learned about the risks and the hazards in their environment.
Now, the inventors that I've mentioned integrated engineering with healthcare.
This is what biomedical engineers do.
At the University of Cape Town, we run a course called Health Innovation and Design.
It's taken by many of our graduate students in biomedical engineering.
The aim of the course is to introduce these students to the philosophy of the design world.
The students are encouraged to engage with communities as they search for solutions to health-related problems.
One of the communities that we work with is a group of elderly people in Cape Town. A recent class project had the task of addressing hearing loss in these elderly people.
The students, many of them being engineers, set out believing that they would design a better hearing aid.
They spent time with the elderly, chatted to their healthcare providers and their caregivers.
And many of those who had hearing aids wouldn't wear them. The students realized that many of these elderly people were in denial of their hearing loss.
For example, their homes and their community center were filled with echoes that interfered with their hearing.
So instead of developing and designing a new and better hearing aid, the students did an audit of the environment, with a view to improving the acoustics.
He had often created products for clients that the client ultimately did not like.
Having completed the course, the student fed back to us that he now realized that it was he who hadn't understood what the client wanted.
So what all of this illustrates is that we're often blinded to real needs in our pursuit of technology.
We need hearing aids. We need fetal heart rate monitors.

He cofounded a company called Deaftronics, which now manufactures the Solar Ear, which is a hearing aid powered by his invention.
My colleague, Sudesh Sivarasu, invented a smart glove for people who have suffered from leprosy.
Even though their disease may have been cured, the resulting nerve damage will have left many of them without a sense of touch in their hands.
This puts them at risk of injury.

It effectively serves as an artificial sense of touch and prevents injury.

The students, many of them being engineers, set out believing that they would design a better hearing aid.

And many of those who had hearing aids wouldn't wear them. The students realized that many of these elderly people were in denial of their hearing loss.
There's a stigma attached to wearing a hearing aid.
They also discovered that the environment in which these elderly people lived did not accommodate their hearing loss.
For example, their homes and their community center were filled with echoes that interfered with their hearing.
So instead of developing and designing a new and better hearing aid, the students did an audit of the environment, with a view to improving the acoustics.
They also devised a campaign to raise awareness of hearing loss and to counter the stigma attached to wearing a hearing aid.
Now, this often happens when one pays attention to the user -- in this case, the elderly -- and their needs and their context.
One often has to move away from the focus of technology and reformulate the problem.
This approach to understanding a problem through listening and engaging is not new, but it often isn't followed by engineers, who are intent on developing technology.
One of our students has a background in software engineering.
He had often created products for clients that the client ultimately did not like.
When a client would reject a product, it was common at his company to proclaim that the client just didn't know what they wanted.
Having completed the course, the student fed back to us that he now realized that it was he who hadn't understood what the client wanted.
Another student gave us feedback that she had learned to design with empathy, as opposed to designing for functionality, which is what her engineering education had taught her.
So what all of this illustrates is that we're often blinded to real needs in our pursuit of technology.
But we need technology.
We need hearing aids. We need fetal heart rate monitors.
So how do we create more medical device success stories from Africa?
How do we create more inventors, rather than relying on a few exceptional individuals who are able to perceive real needs and respond in ways that work?
Well, we focus on needs and people and context. "But this is obvious," you might say, "Of course context is important.
" But Africa is a diverse continent, with vast disparities in health and wealth and income and education.
If we assume that our engineers and inventors already know enough about the different African contexts to be able to solve the problems of our different communities and our most marginalized communities, then we might get it wrong.
It's about deep engagement and an immersion in the realities and the complexities of our context.
And we in Africa are already immersed.
We already have a strong and rich base of knowledge from which to start finding solutions to our own problems.
So let's not rely too much on others when we live on a continent that is filled with untapped talent.
Thank you. (Applause)
Hi. I've received hate online.
A lot of it. And it comes with the territory of my work.
I'm a digital creator, I make things specifically for the internet.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Laughter) My work -- Thanks.
One person applauding, God bless. (Laughter) Mom, hi.
(Laughter) So, my work became popular.
From "beta" to "snowflake" and, of course, the ever-popular "cuck.
So, I called some of them -- only the ones I felt safe talking to -- with a simple opening question: "Why did you write that?
So I couldn't use tools like muting or blocking. Of course, I guess, I could have hung up on him.
You're allowed to.
Josh: It was hell.
DM: Really?
Josh: And it's still hell right now, even though it's only two weeks left.
I'm a little bit bigger -- I don't like to use the word "fat," but I am a little bit bigger than a lot of my classmates and they seem to judge me before they even got to know me.
DM: That's awful.
I mean, I also just want to let you know, Josh, I was bullied in high school, too.
So did our common ground of being bullied in high school erase what he wrote me? No. And did our single phone conversation radically heal a politically divided country and cure systemic injustice?
No, absolutely not, right?
But did our conversation humanize us to each other more than profile pictures and posts ever could? Absolutely. I didn't stop there.
Because some of the hate I received was from "my side.
" So when Matthew, a queer liberal artist like me publicly wrote that I represented some of the worst aspects of liberalism, I wanted to ask him this.
DM: You tagged me in this post.
Did you want me to see it?
Matthew (Laughing): I honestly didn't think that you would. DM: Have you ever been publicly dragged?
Matthew: I have been.
And I just said, "No, I don't care.
" DM: And did you not care?
Matthew: But it was hard.
DM: Did you not care?
Matthew: Oh, I cared, yes.
DM: At the end of these conversations, there's often a moment of reflection.
A reconsideration. And that's exactly what happened at the end of my call with a guy named Doug who had written that I was a talentless propaganda hack.
(Audio) Did the conversation we just had -- does it, like, make you feel differently about how you write online?
Doug: Yeah!
You know, when I said this to you, when I said you were a "talentless hack," I had never conversed with you in my life, really.
I didn't really know anything really about you. And I think that a lot of times, that's what the comment sections really are, it's really a way to get your anger at the world out on random profiles of strangers, pretty much.
DM (Laughing): Yeah, right.
Doug: But it definitely has made me rethink the way that I interact with people online. DM: So I've collected these conversations and many others for my podcast "Conversations with People Who Hate Me.
" (Laughter) Before I started this project, I thought that the real way to bring about change was to shut down opposing viewpoints through epically worded video essays and comments and posts, but I soon learned those were only cheered on by the people who already agreed with me.
Sometimes -- bless you.
Sometimes, the most subversive thing you could do -- yeah, clap for him.
(Laughter) Sometimes, the most subversive thing you could do was to actually speak with the people you disagreed with, and not simply at them.
Now in every one of my calls, I always ask my guests to tell me about themselves.
And it's their answer to this question that allows me to empathize with them.
And empathy, it turns out, is a key ingredient in getting these conversations off the ground, but it can feel very vulnerable to be empathizing with someone you profoundly disagree with.
So I established a helpful mantra for myself. Empathy is not endorsement.
Empathizing with someone you profoundly disagree with does not suddenly compromise your own deeply held beliefs and endorse theirs.
Empathizing with someone who, for example, believes that being gay is a sin doesn't mean that I'm suddenly going to drop everything, pack my bags and grab my one-way ticket to hell, right?
It just means that I'm acknowledging the humanity of someone who was raised to think very differently from me.
I also want to be super clear about something.
This is not a prescription for activism.
I understand that some people don't feel safe talking to their detractors and others feel so marginalized that they justifiably don't feel that they have any empathy to give.
I totally get that.
This is just what I feel well-suited to do.
You know, I've reached out to a lot of people for this podcast.
And some have politely declined, others have read my message and ignored it, some have blocked me automatically when I sent the invitation and one guy actually agreed to do it and then, five minutes into the call, hung up on me.
I'm also aware that this talk will appear on the internet.
And with the internet comes comment sections, and with comment sections inevitably comes hate.
So as you are watching this talk, you can feel free to call me whatever you'd like.
You can call me a "gaywad," a "snowflake," a "cuck," a "beta," or "everything wrong with liberalism.
" But just know that if you do, I may ask you to talk.
And if you refuse or block me automatically or agree and hang up on me, then maybe, babe, the snowflake is you.
Thank you so much.
(Applause) (Cheering) (Applause)Hi. I've received hate online.
A lot of it. And it comes with the territory of my work.
I'm a digital creator, I make things specifically for the internet.
(Laughter) And then -- Sure, I'll take applause.
(Applause) Thank you.
And then, are you familiar with those unboxing videos on YouTube where YouTubers open up the latest electronic gadgets?
Great, so I satirized those in a weekly series, where instead I unboxed intangible ideologies like police brutality, masculinity and the mistreatment of Native Americans.
(Laughter) My work -- Thanks.
One person applauding, God bless. (Laughter) Mom, hi.
(Laughter) So, my work became popular.
Very popular.
I got millions of views, a ton of great press and a slew of new followers.
But the flip side of success on the internet is internet hate.
I was called everything.
From "beta" to "snowflake" and, of course, the ever-popular "cuck.
" Don't worry, I will break these terms down for you. (Laughter) So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar, is shorthand online lingo for "beta male.
" But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings and my fashion aesthetic is rich-white-woman-running-errands, so I'm not angling to be an alpha. (Applause) Doesn't totally work.
(Laughter) Now, "snowflake" is a put-down for people who are sensitive and believe themselves to be unique, and I'm a millennial and an only child, so, duh!
(Laughter) But my favorite, favorite, favorite is "cuck.
" It's a slur, short for "cuckold," for men who have been cheated on by their wives. But friends, I am so gay, that if I had a wife, I would encourage her to cheat on me.
(Laughter) Thank you.
Let's take a look at some of this negativity in action.
Sometimes it's direct.
Like Marcos, who wrote, "You're everything I hate in a human being.
" Thank you, Marcos.
Others are more concise.
Like Donovan, who wrote, "gaywad fagggggg. " Now, I do need to point out, Donovan is not wrong, OK?
In fact, he's right on both counts, so credit where credit is due.
Thank you, Donovan. Others write to me with questions, like Brian, who asked, "Were you born a bitch or did you just learn to be one over time?
" But my favorite thing about this is that once Brian was done typing, his finger must have slipped because then he sent me the thumbs-up emoji.
(Laughter) So, babe, thumbs up to you, too.
(Laughter) It's fun to talk about these messages now.
Right?
And it's cathartic to laugh at them.
But I can tell you that it really does not feel good to receive them.
At first, I would screenshot their comments and make fun of their typos, but this soon felt elitist and ultimately unhelpful.
So over time, I developed an unexpected coping mechanism.
Because most of these messages I received were through social media, I could often click on the profile picture of the person who sent them and learn everything about them.
I could see pictures they were tagged in, posts they'd written, memes they'd shared, and somehow, seeing that it was a human on the other side of the screen made me feel a little better.
Not to justify what they wrote, right?
But just to provide context.
Still, that didn't feel like enough.
So, I called some of them -- only the ones I felt safe talking to -- with a simple opening question: "Why did you write that?
" The first person I spoke to was Josh.
He had written to tell me that I was a moron, I was a reason this country was dividing itself, and he added at the end that being gay was a sin.
I was so nervous for our first conversation.
This wasn't a comments section.
So I couldn't use tools like muting or blocking. Of course, I guess, I could have hung up on him.
But I didn't want to.
Because I liked talking to him.
Because I liked him.
Here's a clip of one of our conversations.
(Audio) Dylan Marron: Josh, you said you're about to graduate high school, right?
Josh: Mmm-hmm.
DM: How is high school for you?
Josh: Am I allowed to use the H-E-double-hockey-stick word?
DM: Oh, yeah.
You're allowed to.
Josh: It was hell.
DM: Really?
Josh: And it's still hell right now, even though it's only two weeks left.
DM: That's awful.
I mean, I also just want to let you know, Josh, I was bullied in high school, too.
So did our common ground of being bullied in high school erase what he wrote me? No. And did our single phone conversation radically heal a politically divided country and cure systemic injustice?
DM: You tagged me in this post.
Matthew (Laughing): I honestly didn't think that you would. DM: Have you ever been publicly dragged?
And I just said, "No, I don't care.
" DM: And did you not care?
Matthew: Oh, I cared, yes.
You know, when I said this to you, when I said you were a "talentless hack," I had never conversed with you in my life, really.
DM (Laughing): Yeah, right.
" (Laughter) Before I started this project, I thought that the real way to bring about change was to shut down opposing viewpoints through epically worded video essays and comments and posts, but I soon learned those were only cheered on by the people who already agreed with me.
Sometimes -- bless you.
Sometimes, the most subversive thing you could do -- yeah, clap for him.
It just means that I'm acknowledging the humanity of someone who was raised to think very differently from me.
I also want to be super clear about something.
This is just what I feel well-suited to do.
I knew the obvious impacts my diagnosis was going to have on work.
And I thought about what could be done to guide these conversations, and then an amazing colleague of mine, Camilla Gunn, developed a "Working with Cancer" toolkit.

Were you supernerdy as a girl?
GS: I don't think I was nerdy, but I was definitely doing the things that the girls weren't doing.
And I used to shy away from telling that story, but if that's what caused me to be an engineer -- hey, I think we should talk about that.
CA: Sixteen years ago, you became employee number seven at SpaceX, and then over the next years, you somehow built a multi-billion-dollar relationship with NASA, despite the fact that SpaceX's first three launches blew up.
I mean, how on earth did you do that?
GS: So actually, selling rockets is all about relationships and making a connection with these customers.
So I think it was helpful for me to be an engineer.
I think it was helpful to my role of running sales for Elon.
CA: And currently, a big focus of the company is, I guess, kind of a race with Boeing to be the first to provide the service to NASA of actually putting humans into orbit.
Safety considerations obviously come to the fore, here.
How are you sleeping?
GS: I actually sleep really well.
I'm a good sleeper, that's my best thing.But I think the days leading up to our flying crew will probably be a little sleepless.
But really, fundamentally, safety comes in the design of the system that you're going to fly people on, and so we've been working for years, actually, almost a decade, on this technology.
We're taking the Dragon cargo spaceship and we're upgrading it to be able to carry crew. And as I said, we've been engineering in these safety systems for quite some time.
CA: So isn't it that there's one system that actually allows instant escape if there's a problem.
GS: That's right. It's called the launch escape system.
CA: I think we have that. Let's show that.
GS: We've got a video of a test that we ran in 2015. So this simulated having a really bad day on the pad.
Basically, you want the capsule to get out of Dodge.
You want it to get away from the rocket that had a bad day right below it. This is if there was an issue on the pad.
We also will be doing another demonstration later this year on if we have an issue with the rocket during flight.
CA: And those rockets have another potential function as well, eventually.
GS: Yeah, so the launch escape system for Dragon is pretty unique.
It's an integrated launch escape system.
It's basically a pusher, so the propellant system and the thrusters are integrated into the capsule, and so if it detects a rocket problem, it pushes the capsule away.
Capsule safety systems in the past have been like tractor pullers, and the reason we didn't want to do that is that puller needs to come off before you can safely reenter that capsule, so we wanted to eliminate, in design, that possibility of failure.
CA: I mean, SpaceX has made the regular reusability of rockets seem almost routine, which means you've done something that no national space program, for example, has been able to achieve. How was that possible?
GS: I think there's a couple of things -- there's a million things, actually -- that have allowed SpaceX to be successful.
The first is that we're kind of standing on the shoulders of giants. Right? We got to look at the rocket industry and the developments to date, and we got to pick the best ideas, leverage them.
We also didn't have technology that we had to include in our vehicle systems. So we didn't have to design around legacy components that maybe weren't the most reliable or were particularly expensive, so we really were able to let physics drive the design of these systems.
CA: I mean, there are other programs started from scratch. That last phrase you said there, you let physics drive the design, what's an example of that?
GS: There's hundreds of examples, actually, of that, but basically, we got to construct the vehicle design from, really, a clean sheet of paper, and we got to make decisions that we wanted to make.
The tank architecture -- it's a common dome design.
One of the other elements of the vehicle that we're flying right now is we do use densified liquid oxygen and densified RP, so it's ultracold, and it allows you to pack more propellent into the vehicle.
It is done elsewhere, probably not to the degree that we do it, but it adds a lot of margin to the vehicle, which obviously adds reliability.
CA: Gwynne, you became President of SpaceX 10 years ago, I think. What's it been like to work so closely with Elon Musk?
GS: So I love working for Elon.
I don't think I'm dumb enough to do something for 16 years that I don't like doing.
He's funny and fundamentally without him saying anything he drives you to do your best work.
He doesn't have to say a word.
You just want to do great work.
CA: You might be the person best placed to answer this question, which has puzzled me, which is to shed light on this strange unit of time called "Elon time.
" For example, last year, I asked Elon, you know, when Tesla would auto-drive across America, and he said by last December, which is definitely true, if you take Elon time into account.
So what's the conversion ratio between Elon time and real time?
(Laughter) GS: You put me in a unique position, Chris.
Thanks for that.
There's no question that Elon is very aggressive on his timelines, but frankly, that drives us to do things better and faster.
I think all the time and all the money in the world does not yield the best solution, and so putting that pressure on the team to move quickly is really important.
CA: It feels like you play kind of a key intermediary role here. I mean, he sets these crazy goals that have their impact, but, in other circumstances, might blow up a team or set impossible expectations.
It feels like you've found a way of saying, "Yes, Elon," and then making it happen in a way that is acceptable both to him and to your company, to your employees.
GS: There is two really important realizations for that. First of all, when Elon says something, you have to pause and not immediately blurt out, "Well, that's impossible," or, "There's no way we're going to do that.
I don't know how. " So you zip it, and you think about it, and you find ways to get that done.
And the other thing I realized, and it made my job satisfaction substantially harder.
But then once I realized that that's his job, and my job is to get the company close to comfortable so he can push again and put us back on that slope, then I started liking my job a lot more, instead of always being frustrated.
CA: So if I estimated that the conversation ratio for Elon time to your time is about 2x, am I a long way out there?
GS: That's not terrible, and you said it, I didn't.
GS: We actually don't chat very much about this particular project, not because we're hiding anything, but this is probably one of the most challenging if not the most challenging project we've undertaken.
No one has been successful deploying a huge constellation for internet broadband, or basically for satellite internet, and I don't think physics is the difficulty here.
I think we can come up with the right technology solution, but we need to make a business out of it, and it'll cost the company about 10 billion dollars or more to deploy this system.
And so we're marching steadily along but we're certainly not claiming victory yet.
CA: I mean, the impact of that, obviously, if that happened to the world, of connectivity everywhere, would be pretty radical, and perhaps mainly for good -- I mean, it changes a lot if suddenly everyone can connect cheaply.
GS: Yeah, there's no question it'll change the world.
CA: How much of a worry is it, and how much of a drag on the planning is it, are concerns just about space junk?
People worry a lot about this.
This would a huge increase in the total number of satellites in orbit.
Is that a concern?
GS: So space debris is a concern, there's no question -- not because it's so likely to happen, but the consequences of it happening are pretty devastating.
So you really need to be a good steward of that.
CA: So despite the remarkable success there of that Falcon Heavy rocket, you're actually not focusing on that as your future development plan. You're doubling down to a much bigger rocket called the BFR, which stands for . . . GS: It's the Big Falcon Rocket.
CA: The Big Falcon Rocket, that's right.
(Laughter) What's the business logic of doing this when you invested all that in that incredible technology, and now you're just going to something much bigger.
Why?
GS: Actually, we've learned some lessons over the duration where we've been developing these launch systems.
But we are working on it right now, we're just not going to cancel Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy and just put in place BFR.
CA: The logic is that BFR is what you need to take humanity to Mars?
GS: That's correct.
CA: But somehow, you've also found other business ideas for this.
GS: Yes. BFR can take the satellites that we're currently taking to orbit to many orbits.
It allows for even a new class of satellites to be delivered to orbit.
Basically, the width, the diameter of the fairing is eight meters, so you can think about what giant telescopes you can put in that fairing, in that cargo bay, and see really incredible things and discover incredible things in space.
But then there are some residual capabilities that we have out of BFR as well.
CA: A residual capability?
GS: It's a residual capability.
CA: Is that what you call this?
Talk about what the heck this is.
Oh wait a sec -- GS: That's Falcon Heavy.
That's worth pointing out, by the way. What a beautiful rocket, and that hangar could just fit the Statue of Liberty in it, so you get a sense of size of that Falcon Heavy Rocket.
CA: And the fact that there are 27 engines there.
That's part of the design principle that you, rather than just inventing ever bigger rockets, you team them up.
GS: It's exactly this residual capability.
We developed the Merlin engine for the Falcon 1 launch vehicle.
And so it was expensive to do, but it was a much more efficient path than starting from scratch.
CA: And the BFR is the equivalent of how much bigger than that, in terms of its power?
GS: BFR is about, I believe, two and half times the size of this.
CA: Right, and so that allows you -- I mean, I still don't really believe this video that we're about to play here.
What on earth is this?
GS: So it currently is on earth, but this is basically space travel for earthlings.
I can't wait for this residual capability.
Basically, what we're going to do is we're going to fly BFR like an aircraft and do point-to-point travel on earth, so you can take off from New York City or Vancouver and fly halfway across the globe.
You'll be on the BFR for roughly half an hour or 40 minutes, and the longest part -- yeah, it's so awesome.
(Applause) The longest part of that flight is actually the boat out and back.
(Laughter) CA: I mean. Gwynne, come on, this is awesome, but it's crazy, right? This is never going to actually happen.
GS: Oh no, it's definitely going to happen.
This is definitely going to happen.
CA: How?
(Applause) So first of all, countries are going to accept this incoming missile -- (Laughter) GS: Chris, so can you imagine us trying to convince a federal range, Air Force bases to take the incomers?
Because we're doing it now, regularly, right?
We're bringing the first stages back, and we're landing them on federal property on an Air Force base.
So I think doing it, I don't know, 10 kilometers out from a city, maybe it's only five kilometers out from a city.
CA: So how many passengers can possibly afford the fortune of flying by space?
GS: So the first BFR is going to have roughly a hundred passengers.
And let's talk a little bit about the business.
Everyone thinks rockets are really expensive, and to a large degree they are, and how could we possibly compete with airline tickets here?
But if you think about it, if I can do this trip in half an hour to an hour, I can do dozens of these a day, right?
And yet, a long-haul aircraft can only make one of those flights a day.
So even if my rocket was slightly more expensive and the fuel is a little bit more expensive, I can run 10x at least what they're running in a day, and really make the revenue that I need to out of that system.
CA: So you really believe this is going to be deployed at some point in our amazing future. When?
GS: Within a decade, for sure.
CA: And this is Gwynne time or Elon time?
GS: That's Gwynne time. I'm sure Elon will want us to go faster.
(Laughter) CA: OK, that's certainly amazing.
(Laughter) GS: I'm personally invested in this one, because I travel a lot and I do not love to travel, and I would love to get to see my customers in Riyadh, leave in the morning and be back in time to make dinner.
CA: So we're going to test this out.
So within 10 years, an economy price ticket, or, like, a couple thousand dollars per person to fly New York to Shanghai.
GS: Yeah, I think it'll be between economy and business, but you do it in an hour.
CA: Yeah, well, OK, that is definitely something.
(Laughter) And meanwhile, the other use of BFR is being developed to go a little bit further than Shanghai.
Talk about this.
You guys have actually developed quite a detailed, sort of, picture of how humans might fly to Mars, and what that would look like.
The booster is going to drop the spaceship off in orbit, low earth orbit, and then return just like we're returning boosters right now.
So it sounds incredible, but we're working on the pieces, and you can see us achieve these pieces.
So booster comes back.
The new thing here is that we're going to actually land on the pad that we launched from.
Currently, we land on a separate pad, or we land out on a boat.
Fast, quick connect. You take a cargo ship full of fuel, or a fuel depot, put it on that booster, get that in orbit, do a docking maneuver, refuel the spaceship, and head on to your destination, and this one is Mars.
CA: So, like, a hundred people go to Mars at one time, taking, what, six months?
Two months?
GS: It ends up depending on how big the rocket is.
I think this first version, and we'll continue to make even bigger BFRs, I think it's a three-month trip.
Right now, the average is six to eight, but we're going to try to do it faster.
CA: When do you believe SpaceX will land the first human on Mars?
GS: It's a very similar time frame from the point-to-point.
It's the same capability.
It will be within a decade -- not this decade.
CA: In real time, again, within a decade.
Well, that would also be amazing.
(Laughter) Why, though?
Seriously, why?
I mean, you've got a company where this is the official stated mission.
Has everyone actually bought into that mission, given that, I mean, there's a lot of people around who think, come on, you've got so much talent, so much technology capability.
There are so many things on earth that need urgent attention.
Why would you have this escape trip off to another planet?
(Applause) GS: So I am glad you asked that, but I think we need to expand our minds a little bit.
There are plenty of things to do on earth, but there are lots of companies working on that.
I think we're working on one of the most important things we possibly can, and that's to find another place for humans to live and survive and thrive.
If something happened on earth, you need humans living somewhere else.
(Applause) It's the fundamental risk reduction for the human species.
And this does not subvert making our planet here better and doing a better job taking care of it, but I think you need multiple paths to survival, and this is one of them.
And let's not talk about the downer piece, like, you go to Mars to make sure all earthlings don't die.
That's terrible, actually, that's a terrible reason to go do it.
Fundamentally, it's another place to explore, and that's what makes humans different from animals, it's our sense of exploration and sense of wonderment and learning something new.
And then I also have to say, this is the first step in us moving to other solar systems and potentially other galaxies, and I think this is the only time I ever out-vision Elon, because I want to meet other people in other solar systems.
Mars is fine, but it is a fixer-upper planet. There's work to do there to make it habitable.
(Laughter) I want to find people, or whatever they call themselves, in another solar system.
CA: That is a big vision.
Gwynne Shotwell, thank you.
You have one of the most amazing jobs on the planet.
GS: Thank you very much. Thanks, Chris.
Don't you love a good nap?
I had come to the conclusion that homelessness was safer for me than being at home.
I was 16. During my homelessness, I joined Atlanta's 3,300 homeless youth in feeling uncared for, left out and invisible each night.
There wasn't and still is not any place for a homeless minor to walk off the street to access a bed.
I realized that most people thought of homelessness as some kind of lazy, drug-induced squalor and inconvenience, but that didn't represent my book bag full of clothes and schoolbooks, or my A+ grade point average.
I would sit on my favorite bench downtown and watch as the hours passed by until I could sneak in a few hours of sleep on couches, in cars, in buildings or in storage units.
I, like thousands of other homeless youth, disappeared into the shadows of the city while the whole world kept spinning as if nothing at all had gone terribly wrong.
The invisibility alone almost completely broke my spirit.
But when I had nothing else, I had the arts, something that didn't demand material wealth from me in exchange for refuge.
A few hours of singing, writing poetry or saving up enough money to disappear into another world at a play kept me going and jolting me back to life when I felt at my lowest.
I would sing for hours. It gave me so much strength to give myself permission to just block it all out and sing.
Five years later, I started my organization, ChopArt, which is a multidisciplinary arts organization for homeless minors.
Our teens take refuge in the transformative elements of the arts, and they depend on the safe space ChopArt provides for them to do that.
An often invisible population uses the arts to step into their light, but that journey out of invisibility is not an easy one.
We have a sibling pair, Jeremy and Kelly, who have been with our program for over three years.
They come to the ChopArt classes every Wednesday evening.
But about a year ago, Jeremy and Kelly witnessed their mom seize and die right in front of them.
They watched as the paramedics failed to revive her.
They cried as their father signed over temporary custody to their ChopArt mentor, Erin, without even allowing them to take an extra pair of clothes on their way out.
This series of events broke my heart, but Jeremy and Kelly's faith and resolve in ChopArt is what keeps me grounded in this work.
Kelly calling Erin in her lowest moment, knowing that Erin would do whatever she could to make them feel loved and cared for, is proof to me that by using the arts as the entry point, we can heal and build our homeless youth population.
And we continue to build.
We build with Devin, who became homeless with his family when his mom had to choose between medical bills or the rent.
He discovered his love of painting through ChopArt.
We build with Liz, who has been on the streets most of her teenage years but turns to music to return to herself when her traumas feel too heavy for her young shoulders.
We build for Maria, who uses poetry to heal after her grandfather died in the van she's living in with the rest of her family.
And so to the youth out there experiencing homelessness, let me tell you, you have the power to build within you.
You have a voice through the arts that doesn't judge what you've been through. So never stop fighting to stand in your light because even in your darkest times, we see you. Thank you.

[A provocation from Danny Hillis:] [It's time to start talking about engineering our climate] What if there was a way to build a thermostat that allowed you to turn down the temperature of the earth anytime you wanted?
Now, you would think if somebody had a plausible idea about how to do that, everybody would be very excited about it, and there would be lots of research on how to do it.
But in fact, a lot of people do understand how to do that.
But there's not much support for research in this area.
And I think part of it is because there are some real misunderstandings about it.
So I'm not going to try to convince you today that this is a good idea.
But I am going to try to get your curiosity going about it and clear up some of the misunderstandings.
So, the basic idea of solar geoengineering is that we can cool things down just by reflecting a little bit more sunlight back into space.
And ideas about how to do this have been around literally for decades.
Clouds are a great way to do that, these low-lying clouds. Everybody knows it's cooler under a cloud.
I like this cloud because it has exactly the same water content as the transparent air around it.
And it just shows that even a little bit of a change in the flow of the air can cause a cloud to form.
We make artificial clouds all the time.
These are contrails, which are artificial water clouds that are made by the passing of a jet engine.
And so, we're already changing the clouds on earth.
By accident.
Or, if you like to believe it, by supersecret government conspiracy.
(Laughter) But we are already doing this quite a lot.
This is a NASA picture of shipping lanes.
Passing ships actually cause clouds to form, and this is a big enough effect that it actually helps reduce global warming already by about a degree.
So we already are doing solar engineering.
There's lots of ideas about how to do this.
People have looked at everything, from building giant parasols out into space to fizzing bubble waters in the ocean. And some of these are actually very plausible ideas.
One that was published recently by David Keith at Harvard is to take chalk and put dust up into the stratosphere, where it reflects off sunlight.
And that's a really neat idea, because chalk is one of the most common minerals on earth, and it's very safe -- it's so safe, we put it into baby food.
And basically, if you throw chalk up into the stratosphere, it comes down in a couple of years all by itself, dissolved in rainwater.
Now, before you start worrying about all this chalk in your rainwater, let me explain to you how little of it it actually takes.
And that turns out to be very easy to calculate.
This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation I made.
And there are some very good reasons for that.
I think it's actually a serious problem.
And we need to do research to do that.
But there's not much support for research in this area.
And I think part of it is because there are some real misunderstandings about it.
So I'm not going to try to convince you today that this is a good idea.
But I am going to try to get your curiosity going about it and clear up some of the misunderstandings.

Now, before you start worrying about all this chalk in your rainwater, let me explain to you how little of it it actually takes.
And that turns out to be very easy to calculate.
This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation I made.
So what does that look like?
I can't visualize 10 teragrams per year.
So I asked the Cambridge Fire Department and Taylor Milsal to lend me a hand. This is a hose pumping water at 10 teragrams a year.
And that is how much you would have to pump into the stratosphere to cool the earth back down to pre-industrial levels.
And it's amazingly little; it's like one hose for the entire earth.
Now of course, you wouldn't really use a hose, you'd fly it up in airplanes or something like that.
But it's so little, it would be like putting a handful of chalk into every Olympic swimming pool full of rain.
It's almost nothing.
So why don't people like this idea?
Why isn't it taken more seriously?
And there are some very good reasons for that.
A lot of people really don't think we should be talking about this at all.
And, in fact, I have some very good friends in the audience who I respect a lot, who really don't think I should be talking about this.
And the reason is that they're concerned that if people imagine there's some easy way out, that we won't give up our addiction to fossil fuels.
And I do worry about that.
I think it's actually a serious problem.
But there's also, I think, a deeper problem, which is: nobody likes the idea of messing with the entire earth -- I certainly don't.
I love this planet, I really do.
And I don't want to mess with it.
But we're already changing our atmosphere, we're already messing with it.
And so I think it makes sense for us to look for ways to mitigate that impact.
And we need to do research to do that.
We need to understand the science behind that.
I've noticed that there's a theme that's kind of developed at TED, which is kind of, "fear versus hope," or "creativity versus caution.
" And of course, we need both of those.
So there aren't any silver bullets. This is certainly not a silver bullet. But we need science to tell us what our options are; that informs both our creativity and our caution.
So I am an optimist about our future selves, but I'm not an optimist because I think our problems are small.
I'm an optimist because I think our capacity to deal with our problems is much greater than we imagine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) This talk sparked a lot of controversy at TED2017, and we encourage you to look at discussions online to see other points of view.
And those treatments would disrupt the interaction between the fungus and the plant either by blocking the plant signal or the fungal reception system which receives those signals. Fungal infections have devastated agriculture crops.
It wouldn't take many large attacks to ravage the world economy.
Using the key, it encodes the text in the documents to random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key it's very difficult to unscramble.
As computers have become more and more powerful, we've had to use larger and larger codes.
Today we routinely use 2048 or 4096 bits.
As you can see, code makers and breakers are engaged in an ongoing battle to outwit each other.
And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, they will even more rapidly crack the complex mathematics that underlies many of our encryption systems today.
Indeed, the quantum computer is likely to turn our present security castle into a mere house of cards.
And there have been some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember those three things important for encryption -- high-quality keys, secure key exchange and a strong algorithm?
Well, advances in science and engineering are putting two of those three elements at risk.
First of all, those keys.
Random numbers are the foundational building blocks of encryption keys.
But today, they're not truly random.
Currently, we construct encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.
Numbers generated by a program or a mathematical recipe will have some, perhaps subtle, pattern to them.
This allowed the cyber criminals to reverse engineer the pseudo-random number generator behind the spinning wheels.
And allowed them, with high accuracy, to predict the spins of the wheels, enabling them to make big financial gains.
Similar risks apply to encryption keys.
So having a true random number generator is essential for secure encryption.
For years, researchers have been looking at building true random number generators.
But most designs to date are either not random enough, fast enough or aren't easily repeatable.
But the quantum world is truly random.
So it makes sense to take advantage of this intrinsic randomness.
Devices that can measure quantum effects can produce an endless stream of random numbers at high speed.
Foiling all those would-be casino criminals.
A select group of universities and companies around the world are focused on building true random number generators.
At my company, our quantum random number generator started life on a two meter by one meter optic table.
We were then able to reduce it to a server-size box.
Today, it's miniaturized into a PCI card that plugs into a standard computer.
This is the world's fastest true random number generator.
It measures quantum effects to produce a billion random numbers per second. And it's in use today to improve security at cloud providers, banks and government agencies around the world.
(Applause) But even with a true random number generator, we've still got the second big cyber threat: the problem of secure key exchange.
Current key exchange techniques will not stand up to a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum key distribution or QKD, which leverages a fundamental, counterintuitive characteristic of quantum mechanics.
The very act of looking at a quantum particle changes it.
Let me give you an example of how this works.
Consider again exchanging the code for the lock with James Bond.
Except this time, instead of a call to give James the code, we're going to use quantum effects on a laser to carry the code and send it over standard optic fiber to James.
We assume that Dr. No is trying to hack the exchange.
Luckily, Dr. No's attempt to intercept the quantum keys while in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.
This allows those intercepted keys to be discarded.
The keys which are then retained can be used to provide very strong data protection.
And because the security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer, or indeed any future supercomputer will not be able to break it.
My team and I are collaborating with leading universities and the defense sector to mature this exciting technology into the next generation of security products.
The internet of things is heralding a hyperconnected era with 25 to 30 billion connected devices forecast by 2020. For the correct functioning of our society in an IoT world, trust in the systems that support these connected devices is vital.
We're betting that quantum technologies will be essential in providing this trust, enabling us to fully benefit from the amazing innovations that are going to so enrich our lives.
Thank you.

June 13, 2014 started as a routine Friday in Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. Redemption is the largest free public health hospital in the city. We are called upon to serve hundreds of thousands of people. In the best of times it puts strain on our resources.
And I felt like Nelson Mandela, it felt like the 'Long Walk to Freedom,' and I walked and raised my hands to the heaven, thanking God for saving my life.

I grew up white, secular and middle class in 1950s America.
That meant watching fireworks on the Fourth of July, trick-or-treating on Halloween and putting presents under a tree at Christmas.
But by the time those traditions got to me, they were hollow, commercial enterprises, which just left me feeling empty.
So from a relatively young age, I found myself looking to fill an existential hole, to connect with something bigger than myself.
Yep, that was it.
(Laughter) So I got the fountain pen, but I didn't get the sense of belonging and confidence I was searching for.
Many years later, I couldn't bear the thought of my son turning 13 without some kind of rite of passage.
So I came up with the idea of a 13th birthday trip, and I offered to take Murphy anywhere in the world that had meaning for him.
A budding young naturalist who loved turtles, he immediately settled on the Galapagos.
And when my daughter, Katie, turned 13, she and I spent two weeks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, where Katie learned for the first time that she was powerful and brave.
Since then, my partner, Ashton, and lots of our friends and relatives have taken their kids on 13th birthday trips, with everyone finding it transformative for both the child and the parent.
I wasn't brought up saying grace.
But for the last 20 years, we've been holding hands before every meal.
It's a beautiful bit of shared silence that brings us all together in the moment.
Ashton tells everyone to "pass the squeeze," while she assures them it's not religious.
(Laughter) So recently, when my family asked me if I could please do something with the more than 250 boxes of stuff that I've collected over a lifetime, my ritual-making impulse kicked in.
I started wondering if I could go further than simple death cleaning.
"Death cleaning" is the Swedish term for clearing out your closets, your basement and your attic before you die, so your kids don't have to do it later.
(Laughter) I pictured my children opening up box after box and wondering why I'd kept any of that stuff.
(Laughter) And then I imagined them looking at a specific picture of me with a beautiful young woman, and asking, "Who on earth is that with Dad?
" (Laughter) And that was the aha moment.
It wasn't the things I'd saved that were important; it was the stories that went with them that gave them meaning.
Could using the objects to tell the stories be the seed of a new ritual, a rite of passage -- not for a 13-year-old, but for someone much further down the road?
So I started experimenting.
I got a few dozen things out of the boxes, I put them about in a room, and I invited people to come in and ask me about anything that they found interesting.
The results were terrific.
A good story became a launching pad for a much deeper discussion, in which my visitors made meaningful connections to their own lives.
Derrius [Quarles] asked me about a Leonard Peltier T-shirt that I'd worn a lot in the '80s, that, sadly, is still relevant today.
Our conversation moved quickly, from a large number of political prisoners in American jails, to Derrius wondering about the legacy of the Black Liberation Movement of the '60s, and how his life might be different if he'd come of age then, instead of 30-odd years later.
At the end of our conversation, Derrius asked me if he could have the T-shirt.
And giving it to him felt just about perfect.
As these conversations established common ground, especially across generations, I realized I was opening a space for people to talk about things that really mattered to them.
And I started seeing myself with a renewed sense of purpose -- not as the old guy on the way out, but as someone with a role to play going forward.
When I was growing up, life ended for most people in their 70s.
People are living far longer now, and for the first time in human history, it's common for four generations to be living side by side.
Turns out to be just what I was looking for: a ritual that's less about dying and more about opening the door to whatever comes next.
Thank you.
(Applause) Onward!
(Applause)
I believe no one is ignorant.We are all experts, only in different fields.
Do we understand what goes on in the day-to-day life of an artist, or do we still believe that artists, no matter how struggling they are, are happy simply because they're following their passion?
I remember thinking to myself, "This is going to change everything about how we communicate.
" [Small thing.
] [Big idea.
When they first came around, they were pretty simple and not particularly glamorous.
And then you put the address of where you want to send the person.
It's actually remarkably easy to learn how to do.
And so, the whole range of references to information elsewhere on the internet is the domain of the hyperlink.
Back when I was in school -- this is before people had wide access to the internet -- if I was going to do a research paper, I would have to physically walk to the library, and if they had the book that you needed, great.
You sometimes had to send out for it, so the process could take weeks.
And it's kind of crazy to think about that now, because, like all great innovations, it's not long after we get access to something that we start to take it for granted.
Back in 1945, there was this guy, Vannevar Bush.
He was working for the US government, and one of the ideas that he put forth was, "Wow, humans are creating so much information, and we can't keep track of all the books that we've read or the connections between important ideas.
" And he had this idea called the "memex," where you could put together a personal library of all of the books and articles that you have access to.
And that idea of connecting sources captured people's imaginations.
Later, in the 1960s, Ted Nelson launches Project Xanadu, and he said, "Well, what if it wasn't just limited to the things that I have?
What if I could connect ideas across a larger body of work?
" In 1982, researchers at the University of Maryland developed a system they called HyperTIES.
They were the first to use text itself as a link marker.
They figured out that this blue link on a gray background was going to work really well in terms of contrast, and people would be able to see it.
Apple invented HyperCard in 1987. You had these stacks of cards, and you could create links in between the cards.
HyperCard actually created the ability to jump around in a story.
These kinds of notions of nonlinear storytelling got a huge boost when the hyperlink came along, because it gave people the opportunity to influence the narrative.
These ideas and inventions, among others, inspired Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.
The hyperlink almost feels like a LEGO block, this very basic building block to a very complex web of connections that exists all around the world.
Because of the way that hyperlinks were first constructed, they were intended to be not only used by many people, but created by many people.
To me, it's one of the most democratic designs ever created.
I think stairs may be one of the most emotionally malleable physical elements that an architect has to work with. [Small thing. Big idea. ] [David Rockwell on the Stairs] At its most basic, a stair is a way to get from point A to point B at different elevations.
Stairs have a common language.
Treads, which is the thing that you walk on.
Riser, which is the vertical element that separates the two treads.
A lot of stairs have nosings that create a kind of edge.
And then, the connected piece is a stringer.
Those pieces, in different forms, make up all stairs.
I assume stairs came to be from the first time someone said, "I want to get to this higher rock from the lower rock.
" People climbed using whatever was available: stepped logs, ladders and natural pathways that were worn over time.
Some of the earliest staircases, like the pyramids in Chichén Itzá or the roads to Mount Tai in China, were a means of getting to a higher elevation, which people sought for worship or for protection.
As engineering has evolved, so has what's practical.
Stairs can be made from all kinds of material.
There are linear stairs, there are spiraled stairs.
Stairs can be indoors, they can be outdoors.
They clearly help us in an emergency.
But they're also a form of art in and of themselves.
As we move across a stairway, the form dictates our pacing, our feeling, our safety and our relationship and engagement with the space around us.
So for a second, think about stepping down a gradual, monumental staircase like the one in front of the New York Public Library.
Stairs add enormous drama.
Think about how stairs signaled a grand entrance and were the star of that moment.
Stairs can even be heroic.
The staircase that remained standing after September 11th and the attack on the World Trade Center was dubbed the "Survivors' Staircase," because it played such a central role in leading hundreds of people to safety.
It's fascinating to me that you see people wanting to hang out on the stairs.
I think they fill a deeply human need we have to inhabit a space more than just on the ground plane.
And so if you're able to sit halfway up there, you're in a kind of magical place.
There are no bad buttons, there are only bad people.
How does that sound?
OK?
[Small thing.
] [Big idea.
] [Isaac Mizrahi on the Button] No one knows who invented the button.
Then about 3,000 years later, someone finally invented the buttonhole, and buttons were suddenly useful.
The button and the buttonhole is such a great invention.
Not only does it slip through the buttonhole, but then it kind of falls into place, and so you're completely secure, like it's never going to open.
The design of a button hasn't changed much since the Middle Ages.
It's one of the most enduring designs in history.
For me, the best buttons are usually round.
There's either a dome button with a little shank, or there's just this sort of round thing with either a rim or not a rim, either two holes or four holes. Almost more important than the button is the buttonhole.
But then fashion moved closer to the body as we discovered uses for the button.
At one time, it was the one way to make clothes fit against the body.
I think the reason buttons have endured for so long, historically, is because they actually work to keep our clothes shut.
Zippers break; Velcro makes a lot of noise, and it wears out after a while.
If a button falls off, you just literally sew that thing on.
A button is kind of there for the long run.
It's not just the most elemental design ever, it's also such a crazy fashion statement.
When I was a kid, my mom knit me this beautiful sweater.
I didn't like it.
And then I found these buttons, and the minute the buttons were on the sweater, I loved it.
If you don't have good taste and you can't pick out a button, then let someone else do it, you know?
I mean that.
The hoodie is an amazing object.
It's one of those timeless objects that we hardly think of, because they work so well that they're part of our lives.
We call them "humble masterpieces.
" [Small thing.
] [Big idea.
] [Paola Antonelli on the Hoodie] The hoodie has been -- even if it was not called so -- it's been an icon throughout history for good and for bad reasons.
The earliest ones that we can trace are from ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
The Middle Ages, you see a lot of monks that were wearing garments that were cape-like, with hoods attached, so therefore, "hoodies.
" Ladies in the 17th century would wear hoodies to kind of hide themselves when they were going to meet their lovers.
There's the image of the hoodie connected to the executioner.
So there's the dark side of the hoodie.
The modern incarnation of the hoodie -- a garment that's made usually of cotton jersey, that has a hood attached with a drawstring; sometimes it has a marsupial pocket -- was introduced in the 1930s by Knickerbocker Knitting Company.
Now it's called Champion.
It was meant to keep athletes warm.
Of course, though, it was such a functional, comfortable garment that it was very rapidly adopted by workmen everywhere.
And then, around the 1980s, it also gets adopted by hip-hop and B-boys, skateboarders, and it takes on this kind of youth street culture.
It was, at the same time, super-comfortable, perfect for the streets and also had that added value of anonymity when you needed it.
And then we have Mark Zuckerberg, who defies convention of respectable attire for businesspeople.
But interestingly, it's also a way to show how power has changed.
If you're wearing a two-piece suit, you might be the bodyguard.
The real powerful person is wearing a hoodie with a T-shirt and jeans.
It's easy to think of the physical aspects of the hoodie.
You can immediately think of wearing the hood up, and you feel this warmth and this protection, but at the same time, you can also feel the psychological aspects of it.
I mean, think of donning a hoodie, all of a sudden, you feel more protected, you feel that you are in your own shell.
We know very well what the hoodie has come to signify in the past few years in the United States.
When Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American kid, was shot by a neighborhood vigilante, and Million Hoodie Marches happened all over the United States, in which people wore hoodies with the hood up and marched in the streets against this kind of prejudice.
It doesn't happen that often for a garment to have so much symbolism and history and that encompasses so many different universes as the hoodie.
So, like all garments, especially all truly utilitarian garments, it is very basic in its design.
But at the same time, it has a whole universe of possibilities attached.
How many people are bored at their desk for how many hours every day and how many days a week and how many weeks a year for how many years in their life?
[Small thing.
Big idea.
] [Daniel Engber on the Progress Bar] The progress bar is just an indicator on a computer that something's happening inside the device.
The classic one that's been used for years is a horizontal bar.
Something happened in the 70s that is sometimes referred to as "the software crisis," where suddenly, computers were getting more complicated more quickly than anyone had been prepared for, from a design perspective.
People were using percent-done indicators in different ways.
So you might have a graphical countdown clock, or they would have a line of asterisks that would fill out from left to right on a screen.
But no one had done a systematic survey of these things and tried to figure out: How do they actually affect the user's experience of sitting at the computer?
This graduate student named Brad Myers, in 1985, decided he would study this.
He found that it didn't really matter if the percent-done indicator was giving you the accurate percent done.
What mattered was that it was there at all.
Just seeing it there made people feel better, and that was the most surprising thing.
He has all these ideas about what this thing could do.
Maybe it could make people relax effectively.
Maybe it would allow people to turn away from their machine and do something else of exactly the right duration.
They would look and say, "Oh, the progress bar is half done.
That took five minutes.
So now I have five minutes to send this fax," or whatever people were doing in 1985. Both of those things are wrong.
Oh!
Great stuff is happening!
" [Progress. . . ] But once you start thinking about the progress bar as something that's more about dulling the pain of waiting, well, then you can start fiddling around with the psychology.
So if you have a progress bar that just moves at a constant rate -- let's say, that's really what's happening in the computer -- that will feel to people like it's slowing down.
We get bored.
Well, now you can start trying to enhance it and make it appear to move more quickly than it really is, make it move faster at the beginning, like a burst of speed.
That's exciting, people feel like, "Oh!
Something's really happening!
So the progress bar at least gives you the vision of a beginning and an end, and you're working towards a goal.
I think in some ways, it mitigates the fear of death.
Too much?How many people are bored at their desk for how many hours every day and how many days a week and how many weeks a year for how many years in their life?
[Small thing.
The classic one that's been used for years is a horizontal bar.
I mean, this goes back to pre-computer versions of this on ledgers, where people would fill in a horizontal bar from left to right to show how much of a task they had completed at a factory.
This is just the same thing on a screen.
Something happened in the 70s that is sometimes referred to as "the software crisis," where suddenly, computers were getting more complicated more quickly than anyone had been prepared for, from a design perspective.

] [Caroline Weaver on the Pencil] The pencil is a very simple object.
It's made of wood with some layers of paint an eraser and a core, which is made out of graphite, clay and water.
The story of the pencil starts with graphite.
People started finding really useful applications for this new substance.
They cut it into small sticks and wrapped it in string or sheepskin or paper and sold it on the streets of London to be used for writing or for drawing or, a lot of times, by farmers and shepherds, who used it to mark their animals.
Over in France, Nicolas-Jacques Conté figured out a method of grinding the graphite, mixing it with powdered clay and water to make a paste.
Meanwhile, over in America, in Concord, Massachusetts, it was Henry David Thoreau who came up with the grading scale for different hardnesses of pencil.
It was graded one through four, number two being the ideal hardness for general use.
The softer the pencil, the more graphite it had in it, and the darker and smoother the line will be. The firmer the pencil, the more clay it had in it and the lighter and finer it will be.
Originally, when pencils were handmade, they were made round.
There was no easy way to make them, and it was the Americans who really mechanized the craft.
Since the early days of pencils, people have loved that they can be erased.
Originally, it was bread crumbs that were used to scratch away pencil marks and later, rubber and pumice.
The attached eraser happened in 1858, when American stationer Hymen Lipman patented the first pencil with an attached eraser, which really changed the pencil game.
The world's first yellow pencil was the KOH-I-NOOR 1500. KOH-I-NOOR did this crazy thing where they painted this pencil with 14 coats of yellow paint and dipped the end in 14-carat gold.
There is a pencil for everyone, and every pencil has a story.
The Blackwing 602 is famous for being used by a lot of writers, especially John Steinbeck and Vladimir Nabokov.
And then, you have the Dixon pencil company.
They're responsible for the Dixon Ticonderoga.
It's an icon, it's what people think of when they think of a pencil and what they think of when they think of school.
And the pencil's really a thing that, I think, the average user has never thought twice about, how it's made or why it's made the way it is, because it's just always been that way.
In my opinion, there's nothing that can be done to make the pencil better than it is.
It's perfect.The sound is a really big part, I think, of the experience of using a pencil, and it has this really audible scratchiness.
(Scratching) [Small thing.

It's made of wood with some layers of paint an eraser and a core, which is made out of graphite, clay and water.
Yeah, it took hundreds of people over centuries to come to this design.
And it's that long history of collaboration that, to me, makes it a very perfect object.
The story of the pencil starts with graphite.

One of the most famous maps works because it really isn't a map at all.
[Small thing.
] [Michael Bierut on the London Tube Map] The London Underground came together in 1908, when eight different independent railways merged to create a single system.
Harry Beck was a 29-year-old engineering draftsman who had been working on and off for the London Underground.
The lines only go in three directions: they're horizontal, they're vertical, or they're 45 degrees.
Likewise, he spaced the stations equally, he's made every station color correspond to the color of the line, and he's fixed it all so that it's not really a map anymore.
In 1933, the Underground decided, at last, to give Harry Beck's map a try.
The Underground did a test run of a thousand of these maps, pocket-size.
They were gone in one hour.
They realized they were onto something, they printed 750,000 more, and this is the map that you see today.
Beck's design really became the template for the way we think of metro maps today.
Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, São Paulo, Sydney, Washington, D. C. -- all of them convert complex geography into crisp geometry.
All of them use different colors to distinguish between lines, all of them use simple symbols to distinguish between types of stations.
They all are part of a universal language, seemingly.
I bet Harry Beck wouldn't have known what a user interface was, but that's really what he designed and he really took that challenge and broke it down to three principles that I think can be applied in nearly any design problem.
First one is focus.
Focus on who you're doing this for.
The second principle is simplicity.
What's the shortest way to deliver that need?
Finally, the last thing is: Thinking in a cross-disciplinary way.
Who would've thought that an electrical engineer would be the person to hold the key to unlock what was then one of the most complicated systems in the world -- all started by one guy with a pencil and an idea.
Automation anxiety has been spreading lately, a fear that in the future, many jobs will be performed by machines rather than human beings, given the remarkable advances that are unfolding in artificial intelligence and robotics.
What's clear is that there will be significant change.
What's less clear is what that change will look like.
My research suggests that the future is both troubling and exciting.
The threat of technological unemployment is real, and yet it's a good problem to have.
And to explain how I came to that conclusion, I want to confront three myths that I think are currently obscuring our vision of this automated future.
A picture that we see on our television screens, in books, in films, in everyday commentary is one where an army of robots descends on the workplace with one goal in mind: to displace human beings from their work.
And I call this the Terminator myth. Yes, machines displace human beings from particular tasks, but they don't just substitute for human beings.
They also complement them in other tasks, making that work more valuable and more important.
Sometimes they complement human beings directly, making them more productive or more efficient at a particular task.
So a taxi driver can use a satnav system to navigate on unfamiliar roads.
The British pie, for instance, is more than a hundred times the size it was 300 years ago.
And so people displaced from tasks in the old pie could find tasks to do in the new pie instead.
As time passes, people spend their income in different ways, changing how they spread it across existing goods, and developing tastes for entirely new goods, too.
So again, the British pie: 300 years ago, most people worked on farms, 150 years ago, in factories, and today, most people work in offices.
Economists call these effects complementarities, but really that's just a fancy word to capture the different way that technological progress helps human beings.
And there's even an app that can identify a bird at a fleeting glimpse.
In economics, if human beings could explain themselves in this way, the tasks are called routine, and they could be automated.
But if human beings can't explain themselves, the tasks are called non-routine, and they're thought to be out reach.
Today, that routine-nonroutine distinction is widespread.
Think how often you hear people say to you machines can only perform tasks that are predictable or repetitive, rules-based or well-defined.
Those are all just different words for routine.
And go back to those three cases that I mentioned at the start. Those are all classic cases of nonroutine tasks.
Ask a doctor, for instance, how she makes a medical diagnosis, and she might be able to give you a few rules of thumb, but ultimately she'd struggle.
She'd say it requires things like creativity and judgment and intuition.
And these things are very difficult to articulate, and so it was thought these tasks would be very hard to automate.
If a human being can't explain themselves, where on earth do we begin in writing a set of instructions for a machine to follow?
Thirty years ago, this view was right, but today it's looking shaky, and in the future it's simply going to be wrong.
Advances in processing power, in data storage capability and in algorithm design mean that this routine-nonroutine distinction is diminishingly useful.
To see this, go back to the case of making a medical diagnosis.
Earlier in the year, a team of researchers at Stanford announced they'd developed a system which can tell you whether or not a freckle is cancerous as accurately as leading dermatologists.
How does it work?
It's not trying to copy the judgment or the intuition of a doctor.
It knows or understands nothing about medicine at all.
Instead, it's running a pattern recognition algorithm through 129,450 past cases, hunting for similarities between those cases and the particular lesion in question.
It's performing these tasks in an unhuman way, based on the analysis of more possible cases than any doctor could hope to review in their lifetime.
It didn't matter that that human being, that doctor, couldn't explain how she'd performed the task.
Now, there are those who dwell upon that the fact that these machines aren't built in our image.
As an example, take IBM's Watson, the supercomputer that went on the US quiz show "Jeopardy! " in 2011, and it beat the two human champions at "Jeopardy!
" The day after it won, The Wall Street Journal ran a piece by the philosopher John Searle with the title "Watson Doesn't Know It Won on 'Jeopardy!
'" Right, and it's brilliant, and it's true.
You know, Watson didn't let out a cry of excitement.
It didn't call up its parents to say what a good job it had done.
It didn't go down to the pub for a drink.
This system wasn't trying to copy the way that those human contestants played, but it didn't matter.
It still outperformed them.
Resolving the intelligence myth shows us that our limited understanding about human intelligence, about how we think and reason, is far less of a constraint on automation than it was in the past.
What's more, as we've seen, when these machines perform tasks differently to human beings, there's no reason to think that what human beings are currently capable of doing represents any sort of summit in what these machines might be capable of doing in the future.
Now the third myth, what I call the superiority myth.
It's often said that those who forget about the helpful side of technological progress, those complementarities from before, are committing something known as the lump of labor fallacy.
The lump of labor fallacy is a very old idea.
Now, most of the time, we expect the opposite, that people feel guilty for being unproductive, you know, a little too much time on Facebook or Twitter at work.
But this worker felt guilty for being more productive, and asked why, he said, "I know I'm doing wrong.
I'm taking away the work of another man. " In his mind, there was some fixed lump of work to be divided up between him and his pals, so that if he used this machine to do more, there'd be less left for his pals to do.
Schloss saw the mistake.
The lump of work wasn't fixed.
As this worker used the machine and became more productive, the price of washers would fall, demand for washers would rise, more washers would have to be made, and there'd be more work for his pals to do.
The lump of work would get bigger.
Schloss called this "the lump of labor fallacy.
But LOLFF.
Here's the mistake: it's right to think that technological progress makes the lump of work to be done bigger.
Some tasks become more valuable. New tasks have to be done.
But it's wrong to think that necessarily, human beings will be best placed to perform those tasks.
And this is the superiority myth.
Yes, the lump of work might get bigger and change, but as machines become more capable, it's likely that they'll take on the extra lump of work themselves.
Technological progress, rather than complement human beings, complements machines instead.
To see this, go back to the task of driving a car.
Today, satnav systems directly complement human beings. They make some human beings better drivers.
But in the future, software is going to displace human beings from the driving seat, and these satnav systems, rather than complement human beings, will simply make these driverless cars more efficient, helping the machines instead.
Or go to those indirect complementarities that I mentioned as well.
The economic pie may get larger, but as machines become more capable, it's possible that any new demand will fall on goods that machines, rather than human beings, are best placed to produce.
The economic pie may change, but as machines become more capable, it's possible that they'll be best placed to do the new tasks that have to be done.
In short, demand for tasks isn't demand for human labor.
Human beings only stand to benefit if they retain the upper hand in all these complemented tasks, but as machines become more capable, that becomes less likely.
So what do these three myths tell us then?
Well, resolving the Terminator myth shows us that the future of work depends upon this balance between two forces: one, machine substitution that harms workers but also those complementarities that do the opposite.
And until now, this balance has fallen in favor of human beings.
But resolving the intelligence myth shows us that that first force, machine substitution, is gathering strength.
Machines, of course, can't do everything, but they can do far more, encroaching ever deeper into the realm of tasks performed by human beings.
Bring these three myths together and I think we can capture a glimpse of that troubling future.
Machines continue to become more capable, encroaching ever deeper on tasks performed by human beings, strengthening the force of machine substitution, weakening the force of machine complementarity.
And at some point, that balance falls in favor of machines rather than human beings.
This is the path we're currently on.
I say "path" deliberately, because I don't think we're there yet, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this is our direction of travel.
That's the troubling part.
Let me say now why I think actually this is a good problem to have.
For most of human history, one economic problem has dominated: how to make the economic pie large enough for everyone to live on.
Go back to the turn of the first century AD, and if you took the global economic pie and divided it up into equal slices for everyone in the world, everyone would get a few hundred dollars.
Almost everyone lived on or around the poverty line.
And if you roll forward a thousand years, roughly the same is true.
But in the last few hundred years, economic growth has taken off.
Those economic pies have exploded in size.
Global GDP per head, the value of those individual slices of the pie today, they're about 10,150 dollars.
If economic growth continues at two percent, our children will be twice as rich as us.
If it continues at a more measly one percent, our grandchildren will be twice as rich as us.
By and large, we've solved that traditional economic problem.
Now, technological unemployment, if it does happen, in a strange way will be a symptom of that success, will have solved one problem -- how to make the pie bigger -- but replaced it with another -- how to make sure that everyone gets a slice.
As other economists have noted, solving this problem won't be easy.
Today, for most people, their job is their seat at the economic dinner table, and in a world with less work or even without work, it won't be clear how they get their slice.
There's a great deal of discussion, for instance, about various forms of universal basic income as one possible approach, and there's trials underway in the United States and in Finland and in Kenya.
Solving this problem is going to require us to think in very different ways.
There's going to be a lot of disagreement about what ought to be done, but it's important to remember that this is a far better problem to have than the one that haunted our ancestors for centuries: how to make that pie big enough in the first place.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Tom Zimmerman: We'd like to take you on a fantastic journey to visit the creatures we call the Elders.
We call them the Elders because a half a billion years ago they tripled the amount of oxygen in the air, which led to an explosion of life, which led to all of us.
We call them the Elders, but you probably know them as plankton. (Laughter) Now, Simone is a physicist, and I'm an inventor.
A couple of years ago, I was giving a talk about an invention I made -- it was a 3D microscope. And Simone was in the audience.
He realized that my microscope could solve a big problem he was having.
Which was, how to measure the movement of plankton in 3D fast enough so he could mathematically model their sensing and behavior. And I frankly needed an application for my microscope, so . . . (Laughter) It was like peanut butter meets chocolate.
(Laughter) So we started working together, studying these amazing creatures.
And then we were alarmed to discover something.
And that's why we're here today.
And I just want to do something with you.
Now, please, just hold your breath for a second.
Yes, literally hold your breath. This is the world without plankton.
You see, plankton generate two-thirds of our oxygen using the sun. OK, now you can breathe, because they're still here. For now.
Indirect measurements have shown that the global phytoplankton population may have decreased by as much as 40 percent between 1950 and 2010 because of climate change.
And you see, this is a problem also because it's starving the fish that eat them.
And about a billion people around the world depend on fish as their primary source of protein from animals.
So you see, this isn't just about breathing. No plankton means no fish.
And that is a lot of food we will need to replace.
There's something else that is interesting.
The bodies of plankton's ancestors actually make up a for lot of the carbon we burn today.
Which is kind of ironic, if you ask me.
Because the plankton that are here today clean that carbon out of the air.
But you see, they don't really hold a grudge. (Laughter) The problem is they cannot keep up with the tremendous amount of carbon we are dumping into the air.
So what does all of this mean?
Well, it means that our big carbon footprint is crushing the very creatures that sustain us.
And yes, like Tom said, killing almost half of the creatures that allow us to breathe is a really big deal.
So you're probably asking yourself: Why aren't we doing something about it?
Our theory is that plankton are tiny, and it's really, really hard to care about something you cannot see.
You see, there's a quote I really like in "The Little Prince" that goes, "What is essential is invisible to the eye.
" We really believe that if more people could come face to . . . cilia with plankton, there is a greater chance we could all rally together and save these creatures that are so important to life on our planet.
TZ: Exactly, Simone.
So to do this, we're going to bring you scuba diving with plankton.
But I just need to shrink you by a factor of 1000, to a scale where the diameter of a human hair is as big as my hand.
And I happen to have invented a machine to do just that.
SB: Anyone here remember "Fantastic Voyage" or "Innerspace?
" Yeah, yeah. Martin Short is one of my all-time favorite actors. And now this -- this is just like that.
TZ: Indeed, yes.
When I was a boy, I saw "Fantastic Voyage," and I really loved how I could travel through the bloodstream and see biology work on a cellular level.
I've always been inspired by science fiction.
As an inventor, I try and turn fantasy into reality.
And I once invented this glove which let me travel and help people like you explore the virtual world.
So now I've invented this machine to let us explore the microscopic world.
It's not virtual, it's real.
Just really, really tiny.
It's based on the microscope that got Simone's attention.
So, here's how it works.
I have an image sensor like the kind in your cell phone, behind the lens.
And then I have a little tray of plankton water like you might find from a river or my fish tank, which I never change the water on.
(Laughter) Because I love plankton.
(Laughter) And underneath I have a light, an LED, which is going to cast shadows of the plankton on the image sensor.
And now this silver thing is an XY plotter, so I can move the image sensor to follow the plankton as they swim.
Now comes the fantasy part.
(Laughter) I put a tilt sensor on this helmet so I can control the microscope with my head.
And now let's look at the video from this image sensor.
These are all plankton.
This is in that little tray, and with my head, I can move the microscope.
So now we're ready to go scuba diving with plankton.
My head will be the navigator, and Simone will be our tour guide.
SB: Yes.
(Laughter) So welcome all to the wonderful world of life in a drop of water.
Actually, as you can see, with this instrument, we are not at all limited to a single drop.
Alright, let's find something.
The little creatures you see in the center of your screen, they are called rotifer.
They are the garbage collectors of our waters.
They break down organic matter and allow it to be reclaimed by the environment.
Now, you know, nature is an amazing recycler.
Structures are continuously built, they are decomposed and recycled, and all of that is powered by solar energy.
But just think.
Think about what will happen if, you know, our garbage collectors didn't come anymore, if they disappeared.
Something else?
Let's look for something else.
Oh, look at that.
You see the big ice-cream-cone-shaped things?
Those are called Stentor, those are amazing creatures.
You know, they are big, but they are a single cell.
You remember the rotifer we just met?
TZ: I agree.
SB: But a Stentor is only a single cell.
And it's able to sense and react to its environment.
You see, it will swim forward when it's happy; it will swim backward when it's trying to get away from something like, you know, a toxic chemical.
With our friends in the Center for Cellular Construction and the help of the National Science Foundation, we are using Stentor to sense the presence of contamination in food and water, which I think is really cool.
Alright, last one.
So the dots that you see there that are, let's say, behind everything, they're algae.
They are the creatures that provide the majority of oxygen in the air.
They convert solar light and carbon dioxide into the oxygen that is filling your lungs right now.
So you see, we all got algae breath.
TZ: (Exhales) SB: Yay! (Laughter) You know, there's something interesting.
About a billion years ago, ancient plants got their photosynthesis capability by incorporating tiny, tiny plankton into their cells.
That's exactly like us putting solar panels on top of our roofs.
So you see, the microscopic world is even more amazing than science fiction.
TZ: Oh, indeed.
So now you've seen how vital plankton are to our lives and how much we need them.
If we kill the plankton, we will die of asphyxiation or starvation, take your pick. Oh, yes, I know it's sad, yes.
(Laughter) In the game of plankton, you win or you die.
(Laughter) Now, what amazes me is, we have known about global warming for over a century.
Ever since the Swedish scientist, Arrhenius, calculated the effect of burning fossil fuel on the earth's temperature.
We've known about this for a long time, but it's not too late if we act now.
Yes, yes, I know, I know, our world is based on fossil fuels, but we can adjust our society to run on renewable energy from the Sun to create a more sustainable and secure future.
That's good for the little creatures here, the plankton, and that good for us -- here's why.
The three greatest concerns of people all around the globe typically are jobs, violence and health.
A job means food and shelter.
Look at these creatures, they're swimming around, they're looking for a place to eat and reproduce.
If a single cell is programmed to do that, it's no surprise that 30 trillion cells have the same agenda. Violence. Dependence on fossil fuels makes a country vulnerable.
Which leads to conflicts all around the oil resources. Solar energy, on the other hand, is distributed around the whole globe, and no one can blockade the sun. (Laughter) And then, finally, health.
Fossil fuels are like a global cigarette.
And in my opinion, coal is like an unfiltered type.
Now, just like smoking, the best time to quit is when?
Audience: Now.
TZ: Now!
Not when you get lung cancer. Now I know if you look around, some people may abandon facts and reason.
Only until suffering -- (Laughter) Yes, they will abandon facts and reason.
But suffering will eventually and inevitably force change.
But let's instead use our neocortex, our new brain, to save the Elders, some of the oldest creatures on the earth.
And let's apply science to harness the energy that has fueled the Elders for millions of years -- the sun.
Thank you.
(Applause)
There's a question I've been puzzling over and writing about for pretty much all of my adult life. Why do some large-scale crises jolt us awake and inspire us to change and evolve while others might jolt us a bit, but then it's back to sleep?
Now, the kind of shocks I'm talking about are big -- a cataclysmic market crash, rising fascism, an industrial accident that poisons on a massive scale.
Now, events like this can act like a collective alarm bell.
Suddenly, we see a threat, we get organized.
We discover strength and resolve that was previously unimaginable.
It's as if we're no longer walking, but leaping.
Except, our collective alarm seems to be busted.
Faced with a crisis, we often fall apart, regress and that becomes a window for antidemocratic forces to push societies backwards, to become more unequal and more unstable.
Ten years ago, I wrote about this backwards process and I called it the "Shock Doctrine.
" So what determines which road we navigate through crisis?
Whether we grow up fast and find those strengths or whether we get knocked back.
And I'd say this is a pressing question these days.
Because things are pretty shocking out there.
Record-breaking storms, drowning cities, record-breaking fires threatening to devour them, thousands of migrants disappearing beneath the waves.
And openly supremacist movements rising, in many of our countries there are torches in the streets.
And now there's no shortage of people who are sounding the alarm.
But as a society, I don't think we can honestly say that we're responding with anything like the urgency that these overlapping crises demand from us.
And yet, we know from history that it is possible for crisis to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap.
And one of the most striking examples of this progressive power of crisis is the Great Crash of 1929. There was the shock of the sudden market collapse followed by all of the aftershocks, the millions who lost everything thrown onto breadlines.
And this was taken by many as a message that the system itself was broken.
And many people listened and they leapt into action.
In the United States and elsewhere, governments began to weave a safety net so that the next time there was a crash there would be programs like social security to catch people.
There were huge job-creating public investments in housing, electrification and transit.
And there was a wave of aggressive regulation to reign in the banks.
Now, these reforms were far from perfect.
In the US, African American workers, immigrants and women were largely excluded.
But the Depression period, along with the transformation of allied nations and economies during the World War II effort, show us that it is possible for complex societies to rapidly transform themselves in the face of a collective threat.
Now, when we tell this story of the 1929 Crash, that's usually the formula that it follows -- that there was a shock and it induced a wake-up call and that produced a leap to a safer place.
Now, if that's really what it took, then why isn't it working anymore?
Why do today's non-stop shocks -- why don't they spur us into action?
Why don't they produce leaps?
Especially when it comes to climate change.
So I want to talk to you today about what I think is a much more complete recipe for deep transformation catalyzed by shocking events.
And I'm going to focus on two key ingredients that usually get left out of the history books.
One has to do with imagination, the other with organization.
Because it's in the interplay between the two where revolutionary power lies.
So let's start with imagination.
The victories of the New Deal didn't happen just because suddenly everybody understood the brutalities of laissez-faire.
This was a time, let's remember, of tremendous ideological ferment, when many different ideas about how to organize societies did battle with one another in the public square.
A time when humanity dared to dream big about different kinds of futures, many of them organized along radically egalitarian lines.
Now, not all of these ideas were good but this was an era of explosive imagining.
This meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against -- crushing poverty, widening inequality -- but just as important, they knew what they were for.
They had their "no" and they had their "yes," too.
They also had very different models of political organization than we do today.
For decades, social and labor movements had been building up their membership bases, linking their causes together and increasing their strength.
Which meant that by the time the Crash happened, there was already a movement that was large and broad enough to, for instance, stage strikes that didn't just shut down factories, but shut down entire cities.
The big policy wins of the New Deal were actually offered as compromises.
Because the alternative seemed to be revolution.
So, let's adjust that equation from earlier.
A shocking event plus utopian imagination plus movement muscle, that's how we get a real leap.
So how does our present moment measure up?
We are living, once again, at a time of extraordinary political engagements.
Politics is a mass obsession.
Progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage.
And yet, we know from history that "no" is not enough.
Now, there are some "yeses" out there that are emerging.
And they're actually getting a lot bolder quickly.
Where climate activists used to talk about changing light bulbs, now we're pushing for 100 percent of our energy to come from the sun, wind and waves, and to do it fast.
Movements catalyzed by police violence against black bodies are calling for an end to militarized police, mass incarceration and even for reparations for slavery.
Students are not just opposing tuition increases, but from Chile to Canada to the UK, they are calling for free tuition and debt cancellation.
And yet, this still doesn't add up to the kind of holistic and universalist vision of a different world than our predecessors had.
So why is that?
Well, very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days.
Environment in one box, inequality in another, racial and gender justice in a couple of other boxes, education over here, health over there.
And within each compartment, there are thousands upon thousands of different groups and NGOs, each competing with one another for credit, name recognition and of course, resources.
In other words, we act a lot like corporate brands.
Now, this is often referred to as the problem of silos.
Now, silos are understandable.
They carve up our complex world into manageable chunks.
They help us feel less overwhelmed.
But in the process, they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue comes up and when somebody else's issue needs our help and support.
And they also keep us from seeing glaring connections between our issues.
So for instance, the people fighting poverty and inequality rarely talk about climate change. Even though we see time and again that it's the poorest of people who are the most vulnerable to extreme weather.
The climate change people rarely talk about war and occupation.
Even though we know that the thirst for fossil fuels has been a major driver of conflict.
The environmental movement has gotten better at pointing out that the nations that are getting hit hardest by climate change are populated overwhelmingly by black and brown people.
But when black lives are treated as disposable in prisons, in schools and on the streets, these connections are too rarely made.
The walls between our silos also means that our solutions, when they emerge, are also disconnected from each other.
What it looks like, what it feels like, and most of all, what its core values are. And that really matters.
Because when large-scale crises hit us and we are confronted with the need to leap somewhere safer, there isn't any agreement on what that place is.
And leaping without a destination looks a lot like jumping up and down.
(Laughter) Fortunately, there are all kinds of conversations and experiments going on to try to overcome these divisions that are holding us back.
And I want to finish by talking about one of them.
A couple of years ago, a group of us in Canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish in our various silos.
So we locked ourselves in a room for two days, and we tried to figure out what bound us together.
In that room were people who rarely get face to face.
There were indigenous elders with hipsters working on transit.
There was the head of Greenpeace with a union leader representing oil workers and loggers.
There were faith leaders and feminist icons and many more.
And we gave ourselves a pretty ambitious assignment: agreeing on a short statement describing the world after we win.
The world after we've already made the transition to a clean economy and a much fairer society.
In other words, instead of trying to scare people about what will happen if we don't act, we decided to try to inspire them with what could happen if we did act.
Sensible people are always telling us that change needs to come in small increments. That politics is the art of the possible and that we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Well, we rejected all of that.
We wrote a manifesto, and we called it "The Leap.
" I have to tell you that agreeing on our common "yes" across such diversity of experiences and against a backdrop of a lot of painful history was not easy work.
But it was also pretty thrilling.
Because as soon as we gave ourselves permission to dream, those threads connecting much of our work became self-evident.
It also became clear what we need to do.
We need to create a culture of care-taking. In which no one and nowhere is thrown away.
In which the inherent value of all people and every ecosystem is foundational.
So we came up with this people's platform, and don't worry, I'm not going to read the whole thing to you out loud -- if you're interested, you can read it at theleap. org. But I will give you a taste of what we came up with.
So we call for that 100 percent renewable economy in a hurry, but we went further.
Calls for new kinds of trade deals, a robust debate on a guaranteed annual income, full rights for immigrant workers, getting corporate money out of politics, free universal day care, electoral reform and more.
What we discovered is that a great many of us are looking for permission to act less like brands and more like movements.
Because movements don't care about credit.
They want good ideas to spread far and wide.
What I love about The Leap is that it rejects the idea that there is this hierarchy of crisis, and it doesn't ask anyone to prioritize one struggle over another or wait their turn.
And though it was birthed in Canada, we've discovered that it travels well.
Since we launched, The Leap has been picked up around the world with similar platforms, being written from Nunavut to Australia, to Norway to the UK and the US, where it's gaining a lot of traction in cities like Los Angeles, where it's being localized.
And also in rural communities that are traditionally very conservative, but where politics is failing the vast majority of people.
Here's what I've learned from studying shocks and disasters for two decades. Crises test us.
We either fall apart or we grow up fast.
Finding new reserves of strength and capacity that we never knew we had.
The shocking events that fill us with dread today can transform us, and they can transform the world for the better.
But first we need to picture the world that we're fighting for.
And we have to dream it up together.
Right now, every alarm in our house is going off simultaneously.
It's time to listen.
It's time to leap. Thank you. (Applause)
The one conversation that uplifted me more than any other in my life was with a woman who told me how, a few days earlier, she drove her Jeep Wrangler to the edge of the Grand Canyon and sat there, revving the engine, thinking about driving over.
Even though I had severe social anxiety, in that conversation, I was totally at ease.
(Laughter) She told me what was going on in her life in the days and months leading up, what her thoughts were at that exact moment, why she wanted to die, and why she didn't do it.
We nodded and half-smiled, and then it was my turn to talk about my journey to a dining table in the hygienic community area of the mental health wing of a mountain-town hospital.
I took too many sleeping pills, and after they treated me for that, they were like, "Hey, we would love it if you would be our guest in the psych ward.
" (Laughter) We joked that her suicide would have made a way better postcard.
(Laughter) We talked shop.
(Laughter) She allowed me to be deeply depressed and have a genuine connection to another person, simultaneously.
For the first time, I identified as somebody living with depression, and I felt good about it -- like I wasn't a bad person for it.
Now imagine one of the people at that table was a member of your family or a close friend.
Would you be comfortable talking to them?
What if instead of the hospital, they were at your kitchen table and told you they were really depressed?
The World Health Organization says that depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide, affecting 350 million people.
The National Institute of Mental Health reports seven percent of Americans experiencing depression in a year.
So depression is super common, yet in my experience, most folks don't want to talk to depressed people unless we pretend to be happy.
A cheerful facade is appropriate for casual interactions.
A depressed person can ask for extra syrup in their pumpkin spice latte without explaining that they need it because they're trapped in the infinite darkness of their soul and they've lost all hope of escape -- (Laughter) again.
(Laughter) Depression doesn't diminish a person's desire to connect with other people, just their ability.
So in spite of what you might think, talking to friends and family living with depression can be really easy and maybe even fun.
Not, like, Facebook-selfie-with-Lady-Gaga- at-an-underground-party fun -- I'm talking about the kind of fun where people enjoy each other's company effortlessly.
Nobody feels awkward, and no one accuses the sad person of ruining the holidays.
Why does this chasm even exist?
On the one side, you have people living with depression who may act in off-putting or confusing ways because they're fighting a war in their head that nobody else can see.
On the other side, the vast majority of people look across the chasm and shake their heads, like, "Why you gotta be so depressed?
" You may recognize a divide like this in your life.
Do you want to build a bridge across it?
You may not want to build a bridge -- and that's a totally valid choice.
Or maybe you'd like to build a stronger connection, but you have a lot of questions and concerns.
You're what I might call "bridge curious.
" (Laughter) Here are some possible reasons why some of you may avoid depressed people.
You might be afraid that if you talk to somebody while they're depressed, you're suddenly responsible for their well-being.
You're not expected to be Dr. Phil. Just be friendly -- more like Ellen.
(Laughter) You may worry that you won't know what to say, and every attempt at conversation will be awkward, and the only time you'll feel comfortable is when you both just give up on talking and stare at your phones.
Words are not the most important thing to focus on.
You might fear seeing your shadow.
Hey, if you have been successfully outrunning your personal emotional demons, that's awesome.
May the wind be at your back.
(Laughter) You can be the least woo-woo person in the world and still connect with depressed people.
Maybe you've heard that depression is contagious, and you're afraid of catching it.
Bring some hand sanitizer.
(Laughter) You're much more likely to catch the joy of human bonding.
Maybe you see depressed people differently.
You think of them as flawed or defective.
Multiple university studies have shown that A students are more likely to have bipolar condition.
Our brains aren't broken or damaged, they just work differently.
I spent a lot of years thinking happy people just don't get it.
(Laughter) I did eventually stop discriminating against happy people -- (Laughter) I began battling depression when I was eight, and decades later, to my surprise, I started winning.
I shifted from being miserable much of the time to enjoying life.
I live pretty well with my bipolar condition, and I've overcome some other mental health conditions like overeating, addiction and social anxiety.
So I live on both sides of this chasm.
And I'm offering some guidance based on my experience to help you build a bridge across it if you want to.
It's not hard science, but I worked with a lot people I know who've lived with depression to refine these suggestions.
First up, some things you might want to avoid -- some "don'ts.
" One of the most off-putting things you can say is, "Just get over it.
" Great idea -- love it, it's just we already thought of that.
(Laughter) The absence of the ability to just get over it is depression.
(Laughter) (Applause) We feel it in our bodies -- it's a physical thing for us.
And medically it's no different from telling someone with a broken ankle or cancer, "just get over it.
" Don't be hell-bent on fixing us.
Like, thank you, but . . . the pressure can make us depressed people feel like we're disappointing you.
Also, things that make some people feel better may not work for us.
You can't cure clinical depression by getting ice cream . . . which is unfortunate, because that would be living the dream.
(Laughter) Don't take a negative response personally.
So, I have a friend who, about a year ago, messaged me that he was really isolated and depressed.
And I suggested some things for him to do, and he was like, "No, no and no.
" And I got mad, like, how dare he not embrace my brilliant wisdom?
(Laughter) And then I remembered times I've been depressed, and how I thought I was doomed in all possible futures, or everybody suddenly hated me, and things like that.
It didn't matter how many people told me otherwise -- I didn't believe them.
So I let my friend know I cared, and I didn't take it personally.
Don't let a lack of bubbly happiness freak you out.
It's not a shark attack.
"Call the coast guard, my friend is sad!
" (Laughter) We can be sad and OK at the same time.
I'm going to say that again, because in our society, we're taught the opposite, and so it's counterintuitive.
Take what's useful.
And remember, you don't have to connect.
If you want to, here are some suggestions that may help -- some "dos.
" Talk to us in your natural voice, right?
You can be you, OK?
If you make an offer to be there for us, clearly state what you can and can't do.
I have told people, "Hey, call or text any time, but I might not be able to get back to you that same day.
" It's totally cool to not make an offer, or to make a narrow offer with really clear boundaries around it.
Give us a sense of control.
Like, get our consent.
I have a friend who, a while back, when I was having a depressive episode, reached out and said, "Hey, I want to check in with you.
Can I call you every day?
Maybe text you every day and call later in the week?
What works for you?
" By getting my permission, she earned my complete confidence and remains one of my best friends today.
And my last suggestion is: interact about not depression, aka, normal stuff. I have a friend who, when people were worried about him, they would call and ask if he wanted to go shopping or help them clean out their garage.
Your depressed friends could be a good source of free labor -- (Laughter) What I'm really getting at is, invite them to contribute to your life in some way, even if it's as small as asking you to go see a movie that you wanted to see in the theater.
So that's a lot of dos and don'ts and maybes, and it's not by any means a definitive list.
The thing to remember is that they're all grounded in one guiding principle.
It's what allowed the woman in the Jeep Wrangler to start me on the path to recovery without even trying.
She talked to me like I belonged and contributed exactly as I was at that moment.
If you talk to a depressed person as if their life is just as valuable, intense and beautiful as yours, then there's no need to build a bridge between you, because you've closed the chasm.
Focus on that instead of your words, and it may be the most uplifting conversation of their life.
What could that do for somebody you care about?
What could it do for you? Thank you. (Applause)
I work on helping computers communicate about the world around us.
There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
Given a scene like this, a modern computer-vision algorithm can tell you that there's a woman and there's a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It might even be able to tell you that the dog is incredibly cute.
I work on this problem thinking about how humans understand and process the world.
The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans.
All the interconnections of related situations.
Maybe you've seen a dog like this one before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this one, and that further evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, past times to the beach, times spent running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have these experiences, to understand what we share and believe and feel, then we're in a great position to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary with our own experiences.
So, digging more deeply into this, a few years ago I began working on helping computers to generate human-like stories from sequences of images.
So, one day, I was working with my computer to ask it what it thought about a trip to Australia.
It took a look at the pictures, and it saw a koala.
It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought it was an interesting-looking creature.
Then I shared with it a sequence of images about a house burning down.
It took a look at the images and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!
" It sent chills down my spine.
It saw a horrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.
I realized that it recognized the contrast, the reds, the yellows, and thought it was something worth remarking on positively.
And part of why it was doing this was because most of the images I had given it were positive images.
That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that, as I worked on improving AI task by task, dataset by dataset, that I was creating massive gaps, holes and blind spots in what it could understand.
And while doing so, I was encoding all kinds of biases.
Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping.
I thought back to the evolution of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- how the first color images were calibrated against a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography was biased against black faces.
And that same bias, that same blind spot continued well into the '90s.
And the same blind spot continues even today in how well we can recognize different people's faces in facial recognition technology.
I though about the state of the art in research today, where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem.
And that in doing so, we were creating more blind spots and biases that the AI could further amplify.
I realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today looks in five years, in 10 years.
Humans evolve slowly, with time to correct for issues in the interaction of humans and their environment.
In contrast, artificial intelligence is evolving at an incredibly fast rate.
And that means that it really matters that we think about this carefully right now -- that we reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and think about how that's informing the technology we're creating and discuss what the technology of today will mean for tomorrow.
CEOs and scientists have weighed in on what they think the artificial intelligence technology of the future will be.
Stephen Hawking warns that "Artificial intelligence could end mankind. " Elon Musk warns that it's an existential risk and one of the greatest risks that we face as a civilization.
Bill Gates has made the point, "I don't understand why people aren't more concerned.
" But these views -- they're part of the story.
The math, the models, the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence are something that we call access and all work with.
We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to.
And beyond that, we can share our experience.
We can share our experiences with technology and how it concerns us and how it excites us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time.
We already see and know this in the technology that we use today.
We use smart phones and digital assistants and Roombas.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, they're that, too.
And they're not all the same.
And there you already see a light shining on what the future holds.
The future continues on from what we build and create right now.
We set into motion that domino effect that carves out AI's evolutionary path.
In our time right now, we shape the AI of tomorrow.
Technology that immerses us in augmented realities bringing to life past worlds.
Technology that helps people to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating.
Technology built on understanding the streaming visual worlds used as technology for self-driving cars. Technology built on understanding images and generating language, evolving into technology that helps people who are visually impaired be better able to access the visual world.
And we also see how technology can lead to problems.
We have technology today that analyzes physical characteristics we're born with -- such as the color of our skin or the look of our face -- in order to determine whether or not we might be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology that crunches through our data, even data relating to our gender or our race, in order to determine whether or not we might get a loan.
All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution of artificial intelligence. Because where we are right now, is within a moment of that evolution.
That means that what we do now will affect what happens down the line and in the future.
If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, then we need to define the goals and strategies that enable that path now.
What I'd like to see is something that fits well with humans, with our culture and with the environment.
Technology that aids and assists those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life equally challenging for everyone.
Technology that works regardless of your demographics or the color of your skin.
And so today, what I focus on is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now.
AI can turn out in many different ways.
But in this case, it isn't a self-driving car without any destination.
This is the car that we are driving.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down. We choose if we need to make a turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There's a vast playing field of all the things that artificial intelligence can become.
It will become many things.
And it's up to us now, in order to figure out what we need to put in place to make sure the outcomes of artificial intelligence are the ones that will be better for all of us. Thank you. (Applause)
On a warm August morning in Harare, Farai, a 24-year-old mother of two, walks towards a park bench.
She looks miserable and dejected.
Now, on the park bench sits an 82-year-old woman, better known to the community as Grandmother Jack.
There's silence for three minutes or so as she reads. And after a long pause, Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath, looks at Farai and says, "I'm here for you.
Would you like to share your story with me?
" Farai begins, her eyes swelling with tears.
She says, "Grandmother Jack, I'm HIV-positive.
I've been living with HIV for the past four years. My husband left me a year ago.
I have two kids under the age of five. I'm unemployed.
I can hardly take care of my children.
" Tears are now flowing down her face.
And in response, Grandmother Jack moves closer, puts her hand on Farai, and says, "Farai, it's OK to cry. You've been through a lot.
Would you like to share more with me?
" And Farai continues.
"In the last three weeks, I have had recurrent thoughts of killing myself, taking my two children with me.
I can't take it anymore.
The clinic nurse sent me to see you. " There's an exchange between the two, which lasts about 30 minutes.
And finally, Grandmother Jack says, "Farai, it seems to me that you have all the symptoms of kufungisisa. " The word "kufungisisa" opens up a floodgate of tears.
So, kufungisisa is the local equivalent of depression in my country.
It literally means "thinking too much.
" The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300 million people globally, today, suffer from depression, or what in my country we call kufungisisa.
And the World Health Organization also tells us that every 40 seconds, someone somewhere in the world commits suicide because they are unhappy, largely due to depression or kufungisisa.
And most of these deaths are occurring in low- and middle-income countries.
In fact, the World Health Organization goes as far as to say that when you look at the age group between 15 to 29, a leading cause of death now is actually suicide.
But there are wider events that lead to depression and in some cases, suicide, such as abuse, conflict, violence, isolation, loneliness -- the list is endless.
But one thing that we do know is that depression can be treated and suicides averted.
But the problem is we just don't have enough psychiatrists or psychologists in the world to do the job.
In most low- and middle-income countries, for instance, the ratio of psychiatrists to the population is something like one for every one and a half million people, which literally means that 90 percent of the people needing mental health services will not get it.
In my country, there are 12 psychiatrists, and I'm one of them, for a population of approximately 14 million.
Now, let me just put that into context.
One evening while I was at home, I get a call from the ER, or the emergency room, from a city which is some 200 kilometers away from where I live.
And the ER doctor says, "One of your patients, someone you treated four months ago, has just taken an overdose, and they are in the ER department. Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK, but they will need neuropsychiatric evaluation.
" Now, I obviously can't get into my car in the middle of the night and drive 200 kilometers.
So as best as we could, over the phone with the ER doctor, we come up with an assessment.
We ensure that suicidal observations are in place.
A week passes.
Three weeks pass.
No Erica.
And one day I get a call from Erica's mother, and she says, "Erica committed suicide three days ago.
She hanged herself from the mango tree in the family garden.
" Now, almost like a knee-jerk reaction, I couldn't help but ask, "But why didn't you come to Harare, where I live?
We had agreed that as soon as you're released from the ER, you will come to me.
" Her response was brief.
"We didn't have the 15 dollars bus fare to come to Harare.
" Now, suicide is not an unusual event in the world of mental health.
But there was something about Erica's death that struck me at the core of my very being.
That statement from Erica's mother: "We didn't have 15 dollars bus fare to come to you," made me realize that it just wasn't going to work, me expecting people to come to me.
And I got into this state of soul-searching, trying to really discover my role as a psychiatrist in Africa.
And after considerable consultation and soul-searching, talking to colleagues, friends and family, it suddenly dawned on me that actually, one the most reliable resources we have in Africa are grandmothers.
Yes, grandmothers.
And I thought, grandmothers are in every community.
There are hundreds of them.
And -- (Laughter) And they don't leave their communities in search of greener pastures.
(Laughter) See, the only time they leave is when they go to a greener pasture called heaven.
(Laughter) So I thought, how about training grandmothers in evidence-based talk therapy, which they can deliver on a bench?
Empower them with the skills to listen, to show empathy, all of that rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy; empower them with the skills to provide behavior activation, activity scheduling; and support them using digital technology.
You know, mobile phone technology.
Pretty much everyone in Africa has a mobile phone today.
So in 2006, I started my first group of grandmothers.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) Today, there are hundreds of grandmothers who are working in more than 70 communities.
And in the last year alone, more than 30,000 people received treatment on the Friendship Bench from a grandmother in a community in Zimbabwe.
(Applause) And recently, we published this work that is done by these grandmothers in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
And -- (Applause) And our results show that six months after receiving treatment from a grandmother, people were still symptom-free: no depression, suicidal ideation completely reduced.
In fact, our results -- this was a clinical trial -- in fact, this clinical trial showed that grandmothers were more effective at treating depression than doctors and -- (Laughter) (Applause) And so, we're now working towards expanding this program.
There are more than 600 million people currently aged above 65 in the world.
And by the year 2050, there will be 1.5 billion people aged 65 and above.
Imagine if we could create a global network of grandmothers in every major city in the world, who are trained in evidence-based talk therapy, supported through digital platforms, networked.
And they will make a difference in communities.
They will reduce the treatment gap for mental, neurological and substance-use disorders. Finally, this is a file photograph of Grandmother Jack.
So, Farai had six sessions on the bench with Grandmother Jack.
Today, Farai is employed.
She has her two children at school.
And as for Grandmother Jack, one morning in February, we expected her to see her 257th client on the bench. She didn't show up.
She had gone to a greener pasture called heaven.
But I believe that Grandmother Jack, from up there, she's cheering on all the other grandmothers -- the increasing number of grandmothers who are making a difference in the lives of thousands of people.
And I'm sure she's in awe when she realizes that something that she helped to pioneer is now spreading to other countries, like Malawi, the island of Zanzibar and coming closer to home here in the Unites States in the city of New York.
May her soul rest in peace.
Thank you.
Now, on the park bench sits an 82-year-old woman, better known to the community as Grandmother Jack.
Farai hands Grandmother Jack an envelope from the clinic nurse.
Grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down as she opens the envelope and reads.
There's silence for three minutes or so as she reads. And after a long pause, Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath, looks at Farai and says, "I'm here for you.
Would you like to share your story with me?
" Farai begins, her eyes swelling with tears.
She says, "Grandmother Jack, I'm HIV-positive.
I've been living with HIV for the past four years. My husband left me a year ago.
I have two kids under the age of five. I'm unemployed.

What we discovered is that the popular story we're told about female virginity is based on two anatomical myths. The truth has been known in medical communities for over 100 years, yet somehow these two myths continue to make life difficult for women around the world.
It tells us that the hymen breaks and bleeds the first time a woman has vaginal sex.
In other words, if there is no blood on the sheets afterwards, then the woman was simply not a virgin.
But the truth is, this is about so much more than an anatomical misunderstanding.
The myths about the hymen have lived on for centuries because they have cultural significance. They have been used as a powerful tool in the effort to control women's sexuality in about every culture, religion and historical decade.
Women are still mistrusted, shamed, harmed and, in the worst cases, subjected to honor killings if they don't bleed on their wedding night.
In Oslo, doctors are examining the hymens of young girls to reassure parents that their children are not ruined.
And sadly, the list goes on.
That could be plastic surgery, known as "revirgination," it could be vials of blood poured on the sheets after sex or fake hymens bought online, complete with theater blood and a promise to "kiss your deep, dark secret goodbye.
" NDB: By telling girls that no deed can be kept secret, that their bodies will reveal them no matter what, we have endowed them with fear.
It's time we put an end to the virginity fraud. It's time we break the myths about the hymen once and for all. ESD: We are medical students, sexual health workers and the authors of "The Wonder Down Under.
(Laughter) Now, it is very hard to hide that something has happened to this hoop, right?
It is different before and after I punched it. The seal is broken, and unless we change the plastic, it won't get back to its intact state.
So if we wanted to do a virginity check on this hoop right here, right now, that would be very easy. It's easy to say that this hoop is not a virgin anymore.
ESD: Now that we know a bit more about the hymen's anatomy, it's time to get back to our two myths: virgins bleed, hymens are lost forever. But the hymen doesn't have to break at all.
(Laughter) You can stretch a hymen, too. In fact, it's very elastic. And for a lot of women, the hymen will be elastic enough to handle a vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage.
But it may look a bit different from before.
It naturally follows that you can't examine the hymen to check for virginity status.
Because if her hymen was never damaged during sex, then what were we expecting to see?
We wish we could say that by removing these myths, everything would be OK, that shame, harm and honor killings would all just disappear.
Sexual oppression of women comes from something much deeper than a simple anatomical misunderstanding about the properties of the hymen.
We opt for using nothing.
But it turns out, we were wrong.
The second myth is a logical consequence of the first.
Women are still mistrusted, shamed, harmed and, in the worst cases, subjected to honor killings if they don't bleed on their wedding night.
It's time we put an end to the virginity fraud. It's time we break the myths about the hymen once and for all. ESD: We are medical students, sexual health workers and the authors of "The Wonder Down Under.
So if we wanted to do a virginity check on this hoop right here, right now, that would be very easy. It's easy to say that this hoop is not a virgin anymore.
(Laughter) NDB: But the hymen is nothing like a piece of plastic you can wrap around your food, or a seal.
In fact . . . it's more like this -- a scrunchie or a rubber band.
The hymen is a rim of tissue at the outer opening of the vagina. And usually, it has a doughnut or a half-moon shape with a large, central hole.
But this varies a lot, and sometimes hymens can have fringes, it can have several holes, or it can consist of lobes. In other words, hymens naturally vary a lot in looks, and that is what makes it so hard to do a virginity check.
ESD: Now that we know a bit more about the hymen's anatomy, it's time to get back to our two myths: virgins bleed, hymens are lost forever. But the hymen doesn't have to break at all.
The hymen is like a scrunchie in function as well as in looks. And you can stretch a scrunchie, right?
(Laughter) You can stretch a hymen, too. In fact, it's very elastic. And for a lot of women, the hymen will be elastic enough to handle a vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage.
For other women, the hymen may tear a bit to make room for the penis, but that won't make it disappear.
But it may look a bit different from before.
It naturally follows that you can't examine the hymen to check for virginity status.
This was noted over 100 years ago in 1906 by the Norwegian doctor Marie Jeancet. She examined a middle-aged sex worker and concluded that her genitalia were reminiscent of a teenage virgin.
Because if her hymen was never damaged during sex, then what were we expecting to see?
ESD: Since hymens come in every shape and form, it is difficult to know if a dent or a fold in it is there because of previous damage or if it's just a normal anatomical variant.
The absurdity of virgin testing is illustrated in a study done on 36 pregnant teenagers. When doctors examined their hymens, they could only find clear signs of penetration in two out of the 36 girls.
There is no virgin seal that magically disappears after sex, and half of virgins can easily have sex without bleeding.
We wish we could say that by removing these myths, everything would be OK, that shame, harm and honor killings would all just disappear.
But of course, it's not that simple.
Sexual oppression of women comes from something much deeper than a simple anatomical misunderstanding about the properties of the hymen.
It's a question of cultural and religious control of women's sexuality. And that is much harder to change.
But we must try.
ESD: As medical professionals, this is our contribution.
We want every girl, parent and [future] husband to know what the hymen is and how it works. We want them to know that the hymen can't be used as a proof of virginity.
And that way, we can remove one of the most powerful tools used to control young women today.
After telling you this, you may wonder what the alternative is, for if we cannot use the hymen as a proof of virginity for women, then what should we use?
We opt for using nothing.
(Cheering) If you -- (Applause) If you really want to know if a woman is a virgin or not, ask her.
(Laughter) But how she answers that question is her choice.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.
There is a moment on the birthing table that feels like dying.
The body in labor stretches to form an impossible circle.
The contractions are less than a minute apart.
Wave after wave, there is barely time to breathe.
The medical term: "transition," because "feels like dying" is not scientific enough.
(Laughter) I checked.
During my transition, my husband was pressing down on my sacrum to keep my body from breaking.
My father was waiting behind the hospital curtain . . . more like hiding.
But my mother was at my side.
The midwife said she could see the baby's head, but all I could feel was a ring of fire.
I turned to my mother and said, "I can't," but she was already pouring my grandfather's prayer in my ear.
(Sikh Prayer) "Tati Vao Na Lagi, Par Brahm Sarnai.
" "The hot winds cannot touch you.
" "You are brave," she said.
"You are brave.
" And suddenly I saw my grandmother standing behind my mother.
And her mother behind her. And her mother behind her.
A long line of women who had pushed through the fire before me.
I took a breath; I pushed; my son was born.
As I held him in my arms, shaking and sobbing from the rush of oxytocin that flooded my body, my mother was already preparing to feed me.
Nursing her baby as I nursed mine.
My mother had never stopped laboring for me, from my birth to my son's birth.
She already knew what I was just beginning to name.
That love is more than a rush of feeling that happens to us if we're lucky.
Love is sweet labor. Fierce. Bloody. Imperfect. Life-giving. A choice we make over and over again.
I am an American civil rights activist who has labored with communities of color since September 11, fighting unjust policies by the state and acts of hate in the street.
And in our most painful moments, in the face of the fires of injustice, I have seen labors of love deliver us.
Revolutionary love is the choice to enter into labor for others who do not look like us, for our opponents who hurt us and for ourselves.
(Laughter) I am a lawyer.
"I see no stranger," said Nanak.
I will even vow to protect them when they are in harm's way.
That's what it means to be a Sikh: S-i-k-h.
You will return to the fire, and I will lead you.
And with sword in her hand and fire in her eyes, she led them where no one else would.
I didn't know what to do, but I had a camera, I faced the fire.
Stories can create the wonder that turns strangers into sisters and brothers.
When white supremacists march in our streets, torches high, hoods off. And I have to reckon with the fact that my son is growing up in a country more dangerous for him than the one I was given.
And when they fail to see our bodies as some mother's child, it becomes easier to ban us, detain us, deport us, imprison us, sacrifice us for the illusion of security.
(Applause) I wanted to abandon my post.
But I made a promise, so I returned to the gas station where Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed 15 years to the day.
I set down a candle in the spot where he bled to death.
His brother, Rana, turned to me and said, "Nothing has changed.
" And I asked, "Who have we not yet tried to love?
" We decided to call the murderer in prison.
The phone rings.
My heart is beating in my ears.
I hear the voice of Frank Roque, a man who once said . . . "I'm going to go out and shoot some towel heads.
We should kill their children, too.
" And every emotional impulse in me says, "I can't.
" It becomes an act of will to wonder.
"Why? " I ask.
"Why did you agree to speak with us?
" Frank says, "I'm sorry for what happened, but I'm also sorry for all the people killed on 9/11." He fails to take responsibility.
I become angry to protect Rana, but Rana is still wondering about Frank -- listening -- responds.
"Frank, this is the first time I'm hearing you say that you feel sorry.
" And Frank -- Frank says, "Yes.
I am sorry for what I did to your brother.
One day when I go to heaven to be judged by God, I will ask to see your brother.
And I will hug him.
And I will ask him for forgiveness.
" And Rana says . . . "We already forgave you.
" Forgiveness is not forgetting.
Forgiveness is freedom from hate.
But if some of us begin to wonder about them, listen even to their stories, we learn that participation in oppression comes at a cost.
It cuts them off from their own capacity to love.
This was my second lesson in revolutionary love.
We love our opponents when we tend the wound in them.
Tending to the wound is not healing them -- only they can do that.
Just tending to it allows us to see our opponents: the terrorist, the fanatic, the demagogue.
They've been radicalized by cultures and policies that we together can change.
I looked back on all of our campaigns, and I realized that any time we fought bad actors, we didn't change very much.
But when we chose to wield our swords and shields to battle bad systems, that's when we saw change.
I have worked on campaigns that released hundreds of people out of solitary confinement, reformed a corrupt police department, changed federal hate crimes policy.
The choice to love our opponents is moral and pragmatic, and it opens up the previously unimaginable possibility of reconciliation.
But remember . . . it took 15 years to make that phone call.
I had to tend to my own rage and grief first.
Loving our opponents requires us to love ourselves.
Gandhi, King, Mandela -- they taught a lot about how to love others and opponents.
They didn't talk a lot about loving ourselves.
This is a feminist intervention.
(Applause) Yes. Yes. (Applause) Because for too long have women and women of color been told to suppress their rage, suppress their grief in the name of love and forgiveness.
But when we suppress our rage, that's when it hardens into hate directed outward, but usually directed inward.
But mothering has taught me that all of our emotions are necessary.
Joy is the gift of love.
Grief is the price of love.
Anger is the force that protects it.
This was my third lesson in revolutionary love.
We love ourselves when we breathe through the fire of pain and refuse to let it harden into hate.
That's why I believe that love must be practiced in all three directions to be revolutionary.
Loving just ourselves feels good, but it's narcissism.
(Laughter) Loving only our opponents is self-loathing.
Loving only others is ineffective.
This is where a lot of our movements live right now.
We need to practice all three forms of love.
And so, how do we practice it?
Ready?
Number one . . . in order to love others, see no stranger.
We can train our eyes to look upon strangers on the street, on the subway, on the screen, and say in our minds, "Brother, sister, aunt, uncle.
" And when we say this, what we are saying is, "You are a part of me I do not yet know.
I choose to wonder about you.
I will listen for your stories and pick up a sword when you are in harm's way.
" And so, number two: in order to love our opponents, tend the wound.
Can you see the wound in the ones who hurt you?
Can you wonder even about them?
And if this question sends panic through your body, then your most revolutionary act is to wonder, listen and respond to your own needs.
Number three: in order to love ourselves, breathe and push.
When we are pushing into the fires in our bodies or the fires in the world, we need to be breathing together in order to be pushing together.
How are you breathing each day?
Who are you breathing with?
Because . . . when executive orders and news of violence hits our bodies hard, sometimes less than a minute apart, it feels like dying.
In those moments, my son places his hand on my cheek and says, "Dance time, mommy?
" And we dance.
In the darkness, we breathe and we dance.
Our family becomes a pocket of revolutionary love.
Our joy is an act of moral resistance.
How are you protecting your joy each day?
Because in joy we see even darkness with new eyes.
And so the mother in me asks, what if this darkness is not the darkness of the tomb, but the darkness of the womb?
What if our future is not dead, but still waiting to be born?
What if this is our great transition?
Remember the wisdom of the midwife. "Breathe," she says.
And then -- "push.
" Because if we don't push, we will die.
If we don't breathe, we will die.
Revolutionary love requires us to breathe and push through the fire with a warrior's heart and a saint's eyes so that one day . . . one day you will see my son as your own and protect him when I am not there.
You will tend to the wound in the ones who want to hurt him.
You will teach him how to love himself because you love yourself.
You will whisper in his ear, as I whisper in yours, "You are brave.
" You are brave.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.
(Applause) (Cheering) (Applause)(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.
There is a moment on the birthing table that feels like dying.

Love is sweet labor. Fierce. Bloody. Imperfect. Life-giving. A choice we make over and over again.
I am an American civil rights activist who has labored with communities of color since September 11, fighting unjust policies by the state and acts of hate in the street.
And in our most painful moments, in the face of the fires of injustice, I have seen labors of love deliver us.
My life on the frontlines of fighting hate in America has been a study in what I've come to call revolutionary love.
Revolutionary love is the choice to enter into labor for others who do not look like us, for our opponents who hurt us and for ourselves.
In this era of enormous rage, when the fires are burning all around us, I believe that revolutionary love is the call of our times.
Now, if you cringe when people say, "Love is the answer . . . " I do, too.
(Laughter) I am a lawyer.
(Laughter) So let me show you how I came to see love as a force for social justice through three lessons.
My first encounter with hate was in the schoolyard.
I was a little girl growing up in California, where my family has lived and farmed for a century.
When I was told that I would go to hell because I was not Christian, called a "black dog" because I was not white, I ran to my grandfather's arms.
Papa Ji dried my tears -- gave me the words of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh faith.
"I see no stranger," said Nanak.
"I see no enemy.
" My grandfather taught me that I could choose to see all the faces I meet and wonder about them.
And if I wonder about them, then I will listen to their stories even when it's hard.
I will refuse to hate them even when they hate me.
I will even vow to protect them when they are in harm's way.
That's what it means to be a Sikh: S-i-k-h.
To walk the path of a warrior saint.
He told me the story of the first Sikh woman warrior, Mai Bhago.
The story goes there were 40 soldiers who abandoned their post during a great battle against an empire. They returned to a village, and this village woman turned to them and said, "You will not abandon the fight.
You will return to the fire, and I will lead you.
" She mounted a horse.
She donned a turban.
And with sword in her hand and fire in her eyes, she led them where no one else would.
She became the one she was waiting for.
"Don't abandon your posts, my dear.
" My grandfather saw me as a warrior.
I was a little girl in two long braids, but I promised.
Fast-forward, I'm 20 years old, watching the Twin Towers fall, the horror stuck in my throat, and then a face flashes on the screen: a brown man with a turban and beard, and I realize that our nation's new enemy looks like my grandfather.
And these turbans meant to represent our commitment to serve cast us as terrorists.
And Sikhs became targets of hate, alongside our Muslim brothers and sisters.
The first person killed in a hate crime after September 11 was a Sikh man, standing in front of his gas station in Arizona.
Balbir Singh Sodhi was a family friend I called "uncle," murdered by a man who called himself "patriot.
" He is the first of many to have been killed, but his story -- our stories barely made the evening news.
I didn't know what to do, but I had a camera, I faced the fire.
I went to his widow, Joginder Kaur. I wept with her, and I asked her, "What would you like to tell the people of America?
" I was expecting blame.
But she looked at me and said, "Tell them, 'Thank you. ' 3,000 Americans came to my husband's memorial.
They did not know me, but they wept with me.
Tell them, 'Thank you.
'" Thousands of people showed up, because unlike national news, the local media told Balbir Uncle's story.
Stories can create the wonder that turns strangers into sisters and brothers.
This was my first lesson in revolutionary love -- that stories can help us see no stranger.
And so . . . my camera became my sword.
My law degree became my shield.
My film partner became my husband.
(Laughter) I didn't expect that.
And we became part of a generation of advocates working with communities facing their own fires.
I worked inside of supermax prisons, on the shores of Guantanamo, at the sites of mass shootings when the blood was still fresh on the ground.
And every time, for 15 years, with every film, with every lawsuit, with every campaign, I thought we were making the nation safer for the next generation.
And then my son was born.
In a time . . . when hate crimes against our communities are at the highest they have been since 9/11. When right-wing nationalist movements are on the rise around the globe and have captured the presidency of the United States.
When white supremacists march in our streets, torches high, hoods off. And I have to reckon with the fact that my son is growing up in a country more dangerous for him than the one I was given.
And there will be moments when I cannot protect him when he is seen as a terrorist . . . just as black people in America are still seen as criminal.
Brown people, illegal.
Queer and trans people, immoral.
Indigenous people, savage.
Women and girls as property.
And when they fail to see our bodies as some mother's child, it becomes easier to ban us, detain us, deport us, imprison us, sacrifice us for the illusion of security.
(Applause) I wanted to abandon my post.
But I made a promise, so I returned to the gas station where Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed 15 years to the day.
" We decided to call the murderer in prison.

"Why did you agree to speak with us?
" Frank says, "I'm sorry for what happened, but I'm also sorry for all the people killed on 9/11." He fails to take responsibility.
I become angry to protect Rana, but Rana is still wondering about Frank -- listening -- responds.
I am sorry for what I did to your brother.
One day when I go to heaven to be judged by God, I will ask to see your brother.
And I will hug him.
" Forgiveness is not forgetting.
Forgiveness is freedom from hate.
Tending to the wound is not healing them -- only they can do that.
Loving our opponents requires us to love ourselves.
(Applause) Yes. Yes. (Applause) Because for too long have women and women of color been told to suppress their rage, suppress their grief in the name of love and forgiveness.
But when we suppress our rage, that's when it hardens into hate directed outward, but usually directed inward.
Joy is the gift of love.
Grief is the price of love.
Anger is the force that protects it.
(Laughter) Loving only our opponents is self-loathing.
We can train our eyes to look upon strangers on the street, on the subway, on the screen, and say in our minds, "Brother, sister, aunt, uncle.

Our family becomes a pocket of revolutionary love.
And so the mother in me asks, what if this darkness is not the darkness of the tomb, but the darkness of the womb?
" Because if we don't push, we will die.
You will whisper in his ear, as I whisper in yours, "You are brave.
" You are brave.
(Applause) (Cheering) (Applause)
(Applause)
My name is Stuart Duncan, but I'm actually probably better known online as "AutismFather. " That's me on the internet.
I had a white list, so only people that I approved could join, and I would just monitor the server as much as I could, just to make sure that nothing went wrong.
I had a white list, so only people that I approved could join, and I would just monitor the server as much as I could, just to make sure that nothing went wrong.
(Laughter) Some kids made friends at school for the first time ever.Some started to share, even give things to other people. It was amazing.
And every single parent came to me and said it was because of Autcraft, because of what you're doing. But why, though?
In it, she covers some of the guidelines I used when I created the server, guidelines that I think help encourage people to be their very best. I hope. For example, communication.
" (Laughter) We award players ranks on the servers based on the attributes they exhibit, such as the "Buddy" rank for people who are friendly towards others, and "Junior Helper" for people that are helpful towards others. We have "Senior Helper" for the adults. But they're obvious, right?
It started to frustrate the other players.
Manson was this 28-year-old interior designer, a father to a loving daughter, and a son who found himself behind bars due to a broken-down judicial system.
Food was not guaranteed that you'd get.
But being in that cell as he awaited the executioner -- because in prison, he did not have a name -- Manson was known by a number. He was just a statistic.
He did not know how long he would wait.
The wait could have been a minute, the executioner could have come the next minute, the next day, or it could have taken 30 years.
The wait had no end.
And in the midst of the excruciating pain, the mental torture, the many unanswered questions that Manson faced, he knew he was not going to play the victim.
I speak that as a fact.
I already decided I was not going to be a victim anymore.
But how was I going to help change a system that was bringing in younger inmates every day who deserve to be with their families?
So I started mobilizing my colleagues in prison, my fellow inmates, to write letters and memoranda to the justice system, to the Judicial Service Commission, the numerous task forces that had been set up in our country, Kenya, to help change the constitution.
And we decided to grasp at those -- to clutch at those straws, if I may use that word -- if only to make the justice system work, and work for all.
Just about the same time, I met a young university graduate from the UK, called Alexander McLean.
Alexander had come in with three or four of his colleagues from university in their gap year, and they wanted to help assist, set up a library in Kamiti Maximum Prison, which if you Google, you will see is written as one of the 15 worst prisons in the world.
That was then.
But when Alexander came in, he was a young 20-year-old boy.
And I was on death row at that time.
And we took him under our wing.
It was an honest trust issue.
He trusted us, even though we were on death row.
And through that trust, we saw him and his colleagues from the university refurbish the library with the latest technology and set up the infirmary to very good standards so that those of us falling sick in prison would not necessarily have to die in indignity.
Having met Alexander, I had a chance, and he gave me the opportunity and the support, to enroll for a university degree at the University of London.
Just like Mandela studied from South Africa, I had a chance to study at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison.
And two years later, I became the first graduate of the program from the University of London from within the prison system.
Having graduated, what happened next -- (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) Having graduated, now I felt empowered.
I was not going to play the helpless victim.
But I felt empowered not only to assist myself, to prosecute my own case, but also to assist the other inmates who are suffering the similar injustices that have just been spoken about here.
So I started writing legal briefs for them.
With my other colleagues in prison, we did as much as we could.
That wasn't enough.
Alexander McLean and his team at the African Prisons Project decided to support more inmates.
And as I'm speaking to you today, there are 63 inmates and staff in the Kenya Prison Service studying law at the University of London through distance learning.
(Applause) These are changemakers who are being motivated not only to assist the most indolent in society, but also to help the inmates and others get access to justice.
Down there in my prison cell, something kept stirring me.
The words of Martin Luther King kept hitting me.
And he was always telling me, "Pete, if you can't fly, you can run.
And if you can't run, you can walk.
But if you can't walk, then you can crawl.
But whatever it is, whatever it takes, just keep on moving.
" And so I had this urge to keep moving.
I still have this urge to keep moving in whatever I do.
Because I feel the only way we can change our society, the only way we can change the justice system -- which has really improved in our country -- is to help get the systems right.
So, on 26th October last year, after 18 years in prison, I walked out of prison on presidential pardon.
I'm now focused on helping APP -- the African Prisons Project -- achieve its mandate of training and setting up the first law school and legal college behind bars.
So as I speak before you today, I stand here in the full knowledge that we can all reexamine ourselves, we can all reexamine our situations, we can all reexamine our circumstances and not play the victim narrative.
The victim narrative will not take us anywhere.
I was behind bars, yeah. But I never felt and I was not a prisoner.
But if you sit thinking that you can't, you won't.
The world needs you now, the world needs you today.
And as I finish my talk, I'd just like to ask each and every single one of you here, wonderful thinkers, changemakers, innovators, the wonderful global citizens we have at TED, just remember the words of Martin Luther King.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)I want to tell you a story about Manson.
Manson was this 28-year-old interior designer, a father to a loving daughter, and a son who found himself behind bars due to a broken-down judicial system.
He was framed for a murder he didn't commit and was sentenced to the gallows.
There were two victims of this murder -- the victim who actually died in the murder and Manson, who had been sentenced to prison for an offense which he did not commit.
He was locked up in a cell, eight by seven, with 13 other grown-up men for 23 and a half hours a day.
Food was not guaranteed that you'd get.
Because the toilet -- The row of the small rooms that were there were slightly bigger than the eight-by-seven cell.
But being in that cell as he awaited the executioner -- because in prison, he did not have a name -- Manson was known by a number. He was just a statistic.
He did not know how long he would wait.
The wait had no end.
And in the midst of the excruciating pain, the mental torture, the many unanswered questions that Manson faced, he knew he was not going to play the victim.
He refused to play the role of the victim.
Change came to Manson when he decided to embrace forgiveness for those who had put him in prison.
I speak that as a fact.
Because I know who Manson is.
I am Manson.
My real name is Peter Manson Ouko.
And after my conviction, after that awakening of forgiveness, I had this move to help change the system.
I already decided I was not going to be a victim anymore.
But how was I going to help change a system that was bringing in younger inmates every day who deserve to be with their families?
So I started mobilizing my colleagues in prison, my fellow inmates, to write letters and memoranda to the justice system, to the Judicial Service Commission, the numerous task forces that had been set up in our country, Kenya, to help change the constitution.

I'm now focused on helping APP -- the African Prisons Project -- achieve its mandate of training and setting up the first law school and legal college behind bars.
Where we are going to train -- (Applause) Where we are going to train inmates and staff not only to assist their fellow inmates, but to assist the entire wider society of the poor who cannot access legal justice.
So as I speak before you today, I stand here in the full knowledge that we can all reexamine ourselves, we can all reexamine our situations, we can all reexamine our circumstances and not play the victim narrative.
The victim narrative will not take us anywhere.
I was behind bars, yeah. But I never felt and I was not a prisoner.
The basic thing I got to learn was that if I thought, and if you think, you can, you will.
But if you sit thinking that you can't, you won't.
It's as simple as that.
And so I'm encouraged by the peaceful revolutionaries I've heard on this stage.
The world needs you now, the world needs you today.
And as I finish my talk, I'd just like to ask each and every single one of you here, wonderful thinkers, changemakers, innovators, the wonderful global citizens we have at TED, just remember the words of Martin Luther King.
Let them continue ringing in your heart and your life.
Whatever it is, wherever you are, whatever it takes, keep on moving.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
I guess because I'm from Tanzania I have a responsibility to welcome all of you once again.
Thank you for coming.
So, first of all, before we start, how many of you in the audience have been in the past a victim of this bug here?
We apologize on behalf of all the mosquito catchers.
Life here was difficult. In its later stages malaria manifested with extreme seizures locally known as degedege. It's killed both women and men, adults and children, without mercy. My home institution, Ifakara Health Institute, began in this valley in the 1950s to address priority health needs for the local communities.
In fact, the name Ifakara refers to a place you go to die, which is a reflection of what life used to be here in the days before organized public health care.
(Laughter) My colleague and myself selected a household, and we started inside and outside, swapping positions every half hour.
And we did this for 12 hours every night for 24 consecutive nights.
We slept for four hours every morning and worked the rest of the day, sorting mosquitoes, identifying them and chopping off their heads so they could be analyzed in the lab to check if they were carrying malaria parasites in their blood mouthparts.
This way we were able to not only know how much malaria was going on here but also which mosquitoes were carrying this malaria.
We were also able to know whether malaria was mostly inside houses or outside houses. Today, ladies and gentlemen, I still catch mosquitoes for a living.
But I do this mostly to improve people's lives and well-being.
This has been called by some people the most dangerous animal on earth -- which unfortunately is true. But what do we really know about mosquitoes?
What it means is that we've got to do more to be able to get to zero. And that's part of our duty.
A new approach. New ways to try and get new options that we can use together with things such as bednets to be able to get to zero. And I'm going to share with you a few examples of the things that my colleagues and myself do.
You put in a trap, lure a lot of mosquitoes and you kill them, right?
There is also modeling work that has demonstrated that even if you were to release just a small number of these genetically modified mosquitoes, that you can actually achieve elimination very, very quickly.
" KK: I won't ask then, you answer.
About 400 of these are Anophelenes, and only about 70 of them have any capacity to transmit malaria. In Africa, we're having to deal with three or four of these as the major guys. They carry most -- like 99 percent of all the malaria we have.
But I do this mostly to improve people's lives and well-being.
This has been called by some people the most dangerous animal on earth -- which unfortunately is true. But what do we really know about mosquitoes?
It turns out we actually know very little.
Consider the fact that at the moment our best practice against malaria are bednets -- insecticide treated bednets. We know now that across Africa you have widespread resistance to insecticides.
And these are the same insecticides, the pyrethroid class, that are put on these bednets. We know now that these bednets protect you from bites but only minimally kill the mosquitoes that they should.
What it means is that we've got to do more to be able to get to zero. And that's part of our duty.
At Ifakara Health Institute we focus very much on the biology of the mosquito, and we try to do this so we can identify new opportunities.
A new approach. New ways to try and get new options that we can use together with things such as bednets to be able to get to zero. And I'm going to share with you a few examples of the things that my colleagues and myself do.
Take this, for example. Mosquitoes breed in small pools of water.
If you watch this, it's beautiful.It's a fantastic phenomenon.
This is where our mosquito-catching work gets really interesting. What we have seen, when we go swarm hunting in the villages, is that these swarm locations tend to be at exactly the same location every day, every week, every month, year in, year out.
They start at exactly the same time of the evening, and they are at exactly the same locations.
What does this tell us?
It means that if we can map all these locations across villages, we could actually crush these populations by just a single blow.
Kind of, you know, bomb-spray them or nuke them out.
And that is what we try to do with young men and women across the villages. We organize these crews, teach them how to identify the swarms, and spray them out. My colleagues and I believe we have a new window to get mosquitoes out of the valley.
But perhaps the fact that mosquitoes eat blood, human blood, is the reason they are the most dangerous animal on earth.
But think about it this way -- mosquitoes actually smell you.
And they have developed incredible sensory organs.
They can smell from as far sometimes as 100 meters away.
And when they get closer, they can even tell the difference between two family members.
They know who you are based on what you produce from your breath, skin, sweat and body odor.
What we have done at Ifakara is to identify what it is in your skin, your body, your sweat or your breath that these mosquitoes like.
Once we identified these substances, we created a concoction, kind of a mixture, a blend of synthetic substances that are reminiscent of what you produce from your body. And we made a synthetic blend that was attracting three to five times more mosquitoes than a human being.
What can you do with this?
You put in a trap, lure a lot of mosquitoes and you kill them, right?
And of course, you can also use it for surveillance.
At Ifakara we wish to expand our knowledge on the biology of the mosquito; to control many other diseases, including, of course, the malaria, but also those other diseases that mosquitoes transmit like dengue, Chikungunya and Zika virus.
And this is why my colleagues, for example -- we have looked at the fact that some mosquitoes like to bite you on the leg region.
And we've now created these mosquito repellent sandals that tourists and locals can wear when they're coming.
And you don't get bitten -- this gives you 'round the clock protection until the time you go under your bednet.
(Applause) My love-hate relationship with mosquitoes continues. (Laughter) And it's going to go a long way, I can see.
But that's OK.
They do what they can to make it work. And we are supporting them.
We are here to make sure that these dreams come true.
Ladies and gentlemen, even if it doesn't happen in our lifetime, even if it doesn't happen before you and me go away, I believe that your child and my child shall inherit a world free of malaria transmitting mosquitoes and free of malaria.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
(Applause) Thank you.
Kelo Kubu: OK, Fredros.
Let's talk about CRISPR for a bit. (Laughter) It's taken the world by storm, it promises to do amazing things.
What do you think of scientists using CRISPR to kill off mosquitoes?
Fredros Okumu: To answer this question, let's start from what the problem is. First of all, we're talking about a disease that still kills -- according to the latest figures we have from WHO -- 429,000 people.
Most of these are African children.
Of course, we've made progress, there are countries that have achieved up to 50-60 percent reduction in malaria burden.
But we still have to do more to get to zero.
There is already proof of principle that gene-editing techniques, such as CRISPR, can be used effectively to transform mosquitoes so that either they do not transmit malaria -- we call this population alteration -- or that they no longer exist, population suppression.
This is already proven in the lab.
There is also modeling work that has demonstrated that even if you were to release just a small number of these genetically modified mosquitoes, that you can actually achieve elimination very, very quickly.
So, CRISPR and tools like this offer us some real opportunities -- real-life opportunities to have high-impact interventions that we can use in addition to what we have now to eventually go to zero.
This is important.
Now, of course people always ask us -- which is a common question, I guess you're going to ask this as well -- "What happens if you eliminate mosquitoes?
" KK: I won't ask then, you answer.
FO: OK. In respect to this, I would just like to remind my colleagues that we have 3,500 mosquito species in this world.
Maybe more than that.
About 400 of these are Anophelenes, and only about 70 of them have any capacity to transmit malaria. In Africa, we're having to deal with three or four of these as the major guys. They carry most -- like 99 percent of all the malaria we have.
If we were to go out with gene editing like CRISPR, if we were to go out with gene drives to control malaria, we would be going after only one or two. I don't see a diversity problem with that. But that's personal view. I think it's OK.
And remember, by the way, all these years we've been trying to eliminate these mosquitoes effectively by spraying them -- our colleagues in America have sprayed with -- really bomb-spraying these insects out of the villages.
In Africa we do a lot of household spraying. All these are aimed solely at killing the mosquitoes. So there's really no problem if we had a new tool.
KK: Thank you.
(Applause)
That same year, businesses invested in those same countries 3.7 trillion dollars.
Now, I get to travel a lot in my work and I'm privileged to see the amazing things that NGOs and some governments are doing with some of that 200 billion dollars: helping malnourished children or families that don't have access to clean water, children who wouldn't be educated otherwise.
But it's not enough because the biggest problems in our world need trillions not just billions.
So if we're going to make lasting and significant progress in the big challenges in our world, we need business, both the companies and the investors, to drive the solutions.
So let's talk about what business should do.
And when I say that, you probably think that I'm going to talk about corporate philanthropy or corporate social responsibility.
CSR is the norm today, and it's very useful.
It provides a route for corporate generosity and that generosity is important to many corporations' employees and customers.
But you know what? It's just not big enough, or strong enough, or durable enough to drive solutions to the biggest problems in our world today because it's incremental cost.
Even when business is booming, CSR just isn't designed to scale.
TSI is the sum of all of the ways business can affect society by doing the real work: thinking about their supply chains, working on their product design and manufacturing processes and their distribution.
The real work of business, when done with innovation, can actually create core business benefits for the company and it can solve the meaningful problems in our world today.
So what does TSI look like?
Focusing on TSI means incorporating social and environmental considerations. And you know what?
It's something that isn't completely new.
It's been thought about for a while.
But the hard part is that corporations almost exclusively still think about something called TSR: total shareholder returns.
But TSI -- total societal impact -- needs to stand alongside TSR as an important and valid driver of corporate strategy and corporate decision-making.
Some companies are already making this happen.
So let me tell you the story about Mars.
Mars is the sixth-largest private company in the United States.
If you're like me, they make some important products, like coffee and chocolate.
So not surprisingly, one of their most important ingredients is cocoa.
And some of their competitors are actually really worried about the sustainability and the availability of cocoa supplies.
But not Mars.
And those certification agency's NGOs are working to help farmers improve crop yields, they're making sure that they get a fair, premium, livable wage and they're helping them address any human rights potential issues in supply chains, and they're helping minimize the effects on the environment, like deforestation.
Basically the difference between all of its earnings and all of its costs.
But what about other industries?
And then if they're best at expanded access to medicines -- making medicines available for the people who need them -- they see a 6.7 percentage point premium on their gross margins.
These numbers are significant.
So it's a pretty exciting way, when they were thinking about how to bring their capabilities to a need in society and at the same time drive their own growth.
Let's move to South Africa, and let's talk about Standard Bank.
In South Africa, the government has a regulation that requires all banks to donate 0.2 percent of their profits to small and medium black-owned enterprises.
They can support a lot more entrepreneurs with capital, and because their success is completely intertwined with the success of the entrepreneurs, they're actually also using the fund to provide technical assistance.
More entrepreneurs supported, more people and communities being lifted out of poverty.
We need to have business -- both companies and investors -- bring creative, innovative corporate strategy and capital to solving the biggest problems in our world.
And when they do that innovatively, and when they do that with all of their thinking and all of their strategy and all of their capital, and they're creating both total shareholder returns and total societal impact, we know that we will solve those problems, both profitably and generously.
Thank you.
That same year, businesses invested in those same countries 3.7 trillion dollars.
Now, I get to travel a lot in my work and I'm privileged to see the amazing things that NGOs and some governments are doing with some of that 200 billion dollars: helping malnourished children or families that don't have access to clean water, children who wouldn't be educated otherwise.
But it's not enough because the biggest problems in our world need trillions not just billions.

And when I say that, you probably think that I'm going to talk about corporate philanthropy or corporate social responsibility.
CSR is the norm today, and it's very useful.
It provides a route for corporate generosity and that generosity is important to many corporations' employees and customers.
But you know what? It's just not big enough, or strong enough, or durable enough to drive solutions to the biggest problems in our world today because it's incremental cost.
Even when business is booming, CSR just isn't designed to scale.
And then of course in a downturn, it's one of the first programs to be cut.
So no, CSR -- corporate social responsibility -- isn't the answer, but TSI -- total societal impact, is.
TSI is the sum of all of the ways business can affect society by doing the real work: thinking about their supply chains, working on their product design and manufacturing processes and their distribution.
The real work of business, when done with innovation, can actually create core business benefits for the company and it can solve the meaningful problems in our world today.
So what does TSI look like?
Focusing on TSI means incorporating social and environmental considerations. And you know what?
It's something that isn't completely new.
It's been thought about for a while.
But the hard part is that corporations almost exclusively still think about something called TSR: total shareholder returns.
But TSI -- total societal impact -- needs to stand alongside TSR as an important and valid driver of corporate strategy and corporate decision-making.
And we've got the data to show you why and how.
Some companies are already making this happen.
They're beginning to make it happen.
So let me tell you the story about Mars.
Mars is the sixth-largest private company in the United States.
If you're like me, they make some important products, like coffee and chocolate.
So not surprisingly, one of their most important ingredients is cocoa.
And some of their competitors are actually really worried about the sustainability and the availability of cocoa supplies.
But not Mars.
They're confident in the stable supply of that crop for the long term.
And why is that?
It's because they partner with NGOs around the world that are working with small shareholder farmers.
And those certification agency's NGOs are working to help farmers improve crop yields, they're making sure that they get a fair, premium, livable wage and they're helping them address any human rights potential issues in supply chains, and they're helping minimize the effects on the environment, like deforestation.
Mars is on a path to 100 percent certified cocoa, so this is a good program for farming communities, it's a good program for the environment, and it's a good program for Mars, who has solved a significant risk in their supply chain.
But now let's get to the data, because it's actually really awesome.
And let me explain exactly what the data points I'm going to talk about are.
When analysts and financial people look at companies, they think about a lot of different statistics.
I want to talk about two of the most important ones.
I'm going to talk about the overall value of a company -- its valuation -- and I'm going to talk about its margin.
Basically the difference between all of its earnings and all of its costs.
But what about other industries?
Biopharmaceutical companies that are the strongest performers on TSI see a 12 percent premium on their valuation.
And then if they're best at expanded access to medicines -- making medicines available for the people who need them -- they see a 6.7 percentage point premium on their gross margins.
Now, these numbers for banks may not seem very big, but in highly competitive industries, even really small differences in margin matter a lot.
Now, what about those consumer goods companies -- the ones who make those products we love like coffee and chocolate?
Consumer goods companies that perform best on total societal impact see an 11 percent valuation premium.
And then if they do those smart things with their supply chain -- inclusive and responsibly sourcing their product -- they see a 4.8 percentage point premium on their gross margins.
These numbers are significant.
All else being equal, companies that perform strongly on social and environmental areas achieve higher margins and higher valuations.
Now, I do understand that companies are under a lot of short-term earnings pressures.
But fortunately, the investors who create some of this pressure are actually more and more themselves starting to think longer-term and starting to think with this TSI lens.
In our conversations and surveys with investors, 75 percent of them say they expect to see improved revenues and improved operating efficiency for companies that are thinking with a TSI lens.
And they're actually starting to incorporate this in their own investing behavior.
Last year, 23 trillion in global assets were in the category of socially responsible investing.
Now, that's five billion over just the last two years.
And it represents a quarter of the total global assets managed in the world.
I know that some of you may be cringing a little bit right now.
Because in my decades of strategy consulting with businesses and NGOs and governments around the world, I find that many businesspeople are hesitant to talk or even sometimes think about the business benefits of doing good.
They somehow think it's going to negate the value of the benefits they're creating for society.
Or that they'll be perceived as heartless or even mercenary.
But we really do need to think differently. We need to think differently because the only way we're going to make substantial progress on the challenging problems of our time is for business to drive the solutions.
The job of business is to meet customer needs and to do so profitably.
They need to to survive.
So one of the best ways for businesses to help ensure their own growth, their own longevity, is to meet some of the hardest challenges in our society and to do so profitably.
And when they do that innovatively, when they do that ethically, responsibly, incredibly, they should be proud.
But if you still aren't sure about this, let's talk about a few more examples.
What if you're a technology company and you're trying to grow your platform and you're trying to grow your customers? Like, Airbnb. Airbnb has a portfolio of total societal impact activities. They're all spot-on their core business.
In one initiative, they're helping enable their community to provide housing for free to those in disaster: crisis survivors and relief workers.
In another effort on their part, they're actually helping and working with NGOs to ensure that people can provide housing for free for refugees.
Now, what I love about this program is that I don't think most people would've figured out how to express their generosity and open their homes for those in such dire need -- certainly not so quickly or so easily or efficiently -- without this innovation by Airbnb.
But at the same time, this is core to their corporate strategy and core to their growth because they grow by increasing the number of hosts and guests using their platform.
But if they'd only been thinking exclusively about the return side of things, I'm not sure they would have ever figured out this route to growth, because they're not charging transaction fees.
So it's a pretty exciting way, when they were thinking about how to bring their capabilities to a need in society and at the same time drive their own growth.
But what if you're trying to find new customer segments?
Let's move to South Africa, and let's talk about Standard Bank.
In South Africa, the government has a regulation that requires all banks to donate 0.2 percent of their profits to small and medium black-owned enterprises.
And many banks just donate this to the entrepreneurs, but Standard Bank thought creatively.
And what they did is they took those funds and they invested them in an independent trust, and they used that trust to fund loans to these black entrepreneurs.
This is a highly leveraged model.
They can support a lot more entrepreneurs with capital, and because their success is completely intertwined with the success of the entrepreneurs, they're actually also using the fund to provide technical assistance.
More entrepreneurs supported, more people and communities being lifted out of poverty.
And it's successful for Standard Bank.
So successful that they're actually working on expanding this program to other areas in their portfolio.
It's not like we haven't been trying to solve the problems in our world for a long time.
We have, and they're still here.
We're making progress, but it's not far enough, or fast enough, or universal enough.
We need to flip our thinking.
We need to have business -- both companies and investors -- bring creative, innovative corporate strategy and capital to solving the biggest problems in our world.
Thank you.
Sometimes these moments are joyous, and sometimes they are heartbreaking, tragic.
My only son Tariq, a university student, kind, generous, a good writer, a good photographer, had aspirations to work for National Geographic, engaged to a beautiful lady, worked as a pizza deliveryman on Fridays and Saturdays.
He was lured to a bogus address by a youth gang.
How do you tell a mother she's never going to see her son again, or hear him laugh, or give him a hug?
I meditate two hours a day.
It's easy to see that my son was a victim of the 14-year-old, a little bit complicated to see that he was a victim of American society.
Well, it's you and me, because I don't believe that society is just happenstance.
And children killing children is not a mark of a civil society.
So nine months after Tariq died, I started the Tariq Khamisa Foundation and our mandate at the Tariq Khamisa Foundation is to stop kids from killing kids by breaking the cycle of youth violence.
Our first and foremost is to save lives of children.
And our third mandate is to teach the principles of nonviolence, of empathy, of compassion, of forgiveness.
No child was born violent.
If you accept that as a truism, nonviolence can also be a learned behavior, but you have to teach it, because kids are not going to learn that through osmosis.
He lost his grandson to the adult prison system.
And I asked him to join me.
The first one is a live assembly with Ples and me.
And I'm happy to share with you that besides teaching these principles of nonviolence, we are able to cut suspensions and expulsions by 70 percent, which is huge.
Five years after Tariq died, and for me to complete my journey of forgiveness, I went to see the young man who killed my son.
He was remorseful.
Tony was born to my daughter, who was 15 when she gave birth to Tony.
Mothering is the toughest job on the planet.
Tony experienced a lot of violence in his life as a young kid.
He was very traumatized in so many different ways.
I wanted to make sure he had everything a kid needed to be successful.
I practice as a Sufi Muslim.
I was born in Africa.
Why?
He just turned 37 on September 22, but I have some good news.
(Applause) And I'm very excited to have him join us, because I know we've saved him, but he will save tens of thousands of students when he shares his testimony in schools that we are present at on a regular basis.
When he says to the kids, "When I was 11, I joined a gang.
When I was 14, I murdered Mr. Khamisa's son.
I've spent the last umpteen years in prison.
I'm here to tell you: it's not worth it," do you think the kids will listen to that voice?
Yes, because his intonations will be of a person that pulled the trigger.
And I know that he wants to turn the clock back.
Of course, that's not possible.
I wish it was.
I would have my son back.
My brother would have his grandson back.
So I think that demonstrates the power of forgiveness.
So what's the big takeaway here?
So I want to end our session with this quote, which is the basis of my fourth book, which incidentally, the foreword for that book was written by Tony.
So it goes like this: sustained goodwill creates friendship.
You don't make friends by bombing them, right?
You make friends by extending goodwill.
That ought to be obvious.
So sustained goodwill creates friendship, sustained friendship creates trust, sustained trust creates empathy, sustained empathy creates compassion, and sustained compassion creates peace.
I call this my peace formula.
It starts with goodwill, friendship, trust, empathy, compassion and peace.
But people ask me, how do you extend goodwill to the person who murdered your child?
I tell them, you do that through forgiveness.
As it's evident it worked for me.
It worked for my family.
What's a miracle is it worked for Tony, it worked for his family, it can work for you and your family, for Israel and Palestine, North and South Korea, for Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.
It can work for the United States of America.
So let me leave you with this, my sisters, and a couple of brothers -- (Laughter) that peace is possible.
How do I know that?
Because I am at peace.
Thank you very much. Namaste. (Applause)Azim Khamisa: We humans have many defining moments in our lives.
Sometimes these moments are joyous, and sometimes they are heartbreaking, tragic.
But at these defining moments, if we are able to make the right choice, we literally manifest a miracle in us and others.
My only son Tariq, a university student, kind, generous, a good writer, a good photographer, had aspirations to work for National Geographic, engaged to a beautiful lady, worked as a pizza deliveryman on Fridays and Saturdays.
He was lured to a bogus address by a youth gang.
And in a gang initiation, a 14-year-old shot and killed him.
The sudden, senseless death of an innocent, unarmed human being; the overwhelming grief of a family; the total confusion as you try to absorb a new, hideous reality.
Needless to say it brought my life to a crashing halt.
One of the hardest things I've ever had to do was to call his mother, who lived in a different city.
How do you tell a mother she's never going to see her son again, or hear him laugh, or give him a hug?
I practice as a Sufi Muslim.
I meditate two hours a day.
And sometimes, in deep trauma and deep tragedy, there is a spark of clarity.
So what I downloaded in my meditation is that there were victims at both ends of the gun.
It's easy to see that my son was a victim of the 14-year-old, a little bit complicated to see that he was a victim of American society.
And that begs the question, well, who is American society?
Well, it's you and me, because I don't believe that society is just happenstance.
I think we are all responsible for the society we've created.
And children killing children is not a mark of a civil society.
So nine months after Tariq died, I started the Tariq Khamisa Foundation and our mandate at the Tariq Khamisa Foundation is to stop kids from killing kids by breaking the cycle of youth violence.
And essentially we have three mandates.
Our first and foremost is to save lives of children.
It's important to do.
We lose so many on a daily basis.
Our second mandate is to empower the right choices so kids don't fall through the cracks and choose lives of gangs and crime and drugs and alcohol and weapons.
And our third mandate is to teach the principles of nonviolence, of empathy, of compassion, of forgiveness.
And I started with a very simple premise that violence is a learned behavior.
No child was born violent.
If you accept that as a truism, nonviolence can also be a learned behavior, but you have to teach it, because kids are not going to learn that through osmosis.
Soon after that, I reached out to my brother here, with the attitude that we had both lost a son.
My son died.
He lost his grandson to the adult prison system.
And I asked him to join me.
With the grace of God, the Tariq Khamisa Foundation has been successful.
We have a safe school model which has four different programs.
The first one is a live assembly with Ples and me.
We are introduced, this man's grandson killed this man's son, and here they are together.
We have in-classroom curriculum.
We have an after school mentoring program, and we create a peace club.
And I'm happy to share with you that besides teaching these principles of nonviolence, we are able to cut suspensions and expulsions by 70 percent, which is huge.
(Applause) Which is huge.
Five years after Tariq died, and for me to complete my journey of forgiveness, I went to see the young man who killed my son.
He was 19 years old.
And I remember that meeting because we were -- he's 37, still in prison -- but at that first meeting, we locked eyeballs.
I'm looking in his eyes, he's looking in my eyes, and I'm looking in his eyes trying to find a murderer, and I didn't.
I was able to climb through his eyes and touch his humanity that I got that the spark in him was no different than the spark in me or anybody else here.
So I wasn't expecting that.
He was remorseful.
He was articulate.
He was well-mannered.
And I could tell that my hand of forgiveness had changed him.
So with that, please welcome my brother, Ples.
(Applause) Ples Felix: Tony is my one and only daughter's one and only child.
Tony was born to my daughter, who was 15 when she gave birth to Tony.
Mothering is the toughest job on the planet.
There is no tougher job on the planet than raising another human being and making sure they're safe, secure and well-positioned to be successful in life.
Tony experienced a lot of violence in his life as a young kid.
He saw one of his favorite cousins be murdered in a hail of automatic weapon fire and gang involvement in Los Angeles.
He was very traumatized in so many different ways.
Tony came to live with me.
I wanted to make sure he had everything a kid needed to be successful.
But all it did was to make his anxiety go higher and to create a more . . . more deadly thinking on his part.
He was invited to a robbery, he was given a 9mm handgun.
And at the presence of an 18-year-old who commanded him and two 14-year-old boys he thought were his friends, he shot and killed Tariq Khamisa, this man's son.
There are no words, there are no words that can express the loss of a child.
At my understanding that my grandson was responsible for the murder of this human being, I went to the prayer closet, like I was taught by my old folks, and began to pray and meditate.
The one thing that Mr. Khamisa and I have in common, and we didn't know this, besides being wonderful human beings, is that we both meditate.
(Laughter) It was very helpful for me because it offered me an opportunity to seek guidance and clarity about how I wanted to be of support of this man and his family in this loss.
The programs that we have in the Tariq Khamisa Foundation provide so many tools for the kids to put in their toolkit so they could carry them throughout their lives.
It's important that our children understand that loving, caring adults care for them and support them, but it's also important that our children learn to meditate, learn to be peaceful, learn to be centered and learn to interact with the other children in a kind, empathetic and wonderfully loving way.
We need more love in our society and that's why we are here to share the love with children, because our children will lead the way for us, because all of us will depend on our children.
As we grow older and retire, they will take over this world for us, so as much love as we teach them, they will give it back to us. Blessings. Thank you.
(Applause) AK: So I was born in Kenya, I was educated in England, and my brother here is a Baptist.
I practice as a Sufi Muslim.
He's African American, but I always tell him, I'm the African American in the group.
I was born in Africa.
You were not.
(Laughter) And I naturalized as a citizen.
I'm a first-generation citizen.
And I felt that, as an American citizen, I must take my share of the responsibility for the murder of my son.
Why?
Because it was fired by an American child.
You could take the position, he killed my one and only son, he should be hung from the highest pole.
How does that improve society?
And I know you are probably wondering what happened to that young man.
He's still in prison.
He just turned 37 on September 22, but I have some good news.
We've been trying to get him out for 12 years.
He finally will join us a year from now.
(Applause) And I'm very excited to have him join us, because I know we've saved him, but he will save tens of thousands of students when he shares his testimony in schools that we are present at on a regular basis.
When he says to the kids, "When I was 11, I joined a gang.
I'm here to tell you: it's not worth it," do you think the kids will listen to that voice?
Of course, that's not possible.
My brother would have his grandson back.
So I think that demonstrates the power of forgiveness.
So I want to end our session with this quote, which is the basis of my fourth book, which incidentally, the foreword for that book was written by Tony.
So it goes like this: sustained goodwill creates friendship.
You don't make friends by bombing them, right?
You make friends by extending goodwill.
That ought to be obvious.
I call this my peace formula.
But people ask me, how do you extend goodwill to the person who murdered your child?
It can work for the United States of America.
How do I know that?
I'm changing his name to protect his safety.
He says children now walk long distances with cattle and buffalo to find uncontaminated grazing land.
He says many of those kids have dropped out of school, including three of his own.
Right now, in Sierra Leone, in Cambodia, in Ethiopia, farmers are being cajoled into putting their thumbprints on 50-year lease agreements, signing away all the land they've ever known for a pittance without anybody even explaining the terms.
Law is supposed to be the difference between a society ruled by the most powerful and one that honors the dignity of everyone, strong or weak.
(Laughter) But grandma's right, in a way.
We lawyers are usually expensive, first of all, and we tend to focus on formal court channels that are impractical for many of the problems people face.
Worse, our profession has shrouded law in a cloak of complexity.
After about a year in law school, I almost dropped out.
2013, he did reach the gates of that factory with the bucket of petrol in his hands, but he was arrested before he could follow through.
Then, two years later, he met someone.
I'm going to call him Kush.
This is Khadija Hamsa.
Without an ID, you can't apply for a job.
In the United States, among many other problems, we have a housing crisis.
In many cities, 90 percent of the landlords in housing court have attorneys, while 90 percent of the tenants do not.
In New York, a new crew of paralegals -- they're called Access to Justice Navigators -- helps people to understand housing law and to advocate for themselves.
Normally in New York, one out of nine tenants brought to housing court gets evicted.
Researchers took a look at 150 cases in which people had help from these paralegals, and they found no evictions at all, not one.
A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way.
I see the beginnings of a real movement, but we're nowhere near what's necessary.
Not yet.
In most countries around the world, governments do not provide a single dollar of support to paralegals like Hassan and Kush.
Most governments don't even recognize the role paralegals play, or protect paralegals from harm.
I also don't want to give you the impression that paralegals and their clients win every time.
Not at all.
That cement factory behind Ravi's village, it's been turning off the filtration system at night, when it's least likely that the company would get caught.
Running that filter costs money.
Ravi WhatsApps photos of the polluted night sky.
This is one he sent to Kush in May.
Ravi says the air is still unbreathable.
At one point this year, Ravi went on hunger strike.
Kush was frustrated.
He said, "We can win if we use the law.
" Ravi said, "I believe in the law, I do, but it's not getting us far enough.
" Whether it's India, Kenya, the United States or anywhere else, trying to squeeze justice out of broken systems is like Ravi's case.
Hope and despair are neck and neck.
And so not only do we urgently need to support and protect the work of barefoot lawyers around the world, we need to change the systems themselves.
Every case a paralegal takes on is a story about how a system is working in practice.
When you put those stories together, it gives you a detailed portrait of the system as a whole.
People can use that information to demand improvements to laws and policies.
In India, paralegals and clients have drawn on their case experience to propose smarter regulations for the handling of minerals.
In Kenya, paralegals and clients are using data from thousands of cases to argue that vetting is unconstitutional.
This is a different way of approaching reform.
This is not a consultant flying into Myanmar with a template he's going to cut and paste from Macedonia, and this is not an angry tweet.
This is about growing reforms from the experience of ordinary people trying to make the rules and systems work.
This transformation in the relationship between people and law is the right thing to do.
It's also essential for overcoming all of the other great challenges of our times.
We are not going to avert environmental collapse if the people most affected by pollution don't have a say in what happens to the land and the water, and we won't succeed in reducing poverty or expanding opportunity if poor people can't exercise their basic rights.
And I believe we won't overcome the despair that authoritarian politicians prey upon if our systems stay rigged.
I called Ravi before coming here to ask permission to share his story.
I asked if there was any message he wanted to give people.
He said, "[Gujarati].
" Wake up. "[Gujarati]. " Don't be afraid.
"[Gujarati]. " Fight with paper.
By that I think he means fight using law rather than guns. "[Gujarati]. " Maybe not today, maybe not this year, maybe not in five years, but find justice.
If this guy, whose entire community is being poisoned every single day, who was ready to take his own life -- if he's not giving up on seeking justice, then the world can't give up either.
Making that happen, winning that fight, requires all of us.
Thank you guys.
Thank you.
(Applause) Kelo Kubu: Thanks, Vivek.
So I'm going to make a few assumptions that people in this room know what the Sustainable Development Goals are and how the process works, but I want us to talk a little bit about Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions.
Vivek Maru: Yeah.
Anybody remember the Millennium Development Goals?
They were adopted in 2000 by the UN and governments around the world, and they were for essential, laudable things.
It was reduce child mortality by two thirds, cut hunger in half, crucial things.
But there was no mention of justice or fairness or accountability or corruption, and we have made progress during the 15 years when those goals were in effect, but we are way behind what justice demands, and we're not going to get there unless we take justice into account.
And so when the debate started about the next development framework, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, our community came together around the world to argue that access to justice and legal empowerment should be a part of that new framework.
And there was a lot of resistance.
Those things are more political, more contentious than the other ones, so we didn't know until the night before whether it was going to come through.
We squeaked by.
The 16th out of 17 goals commits to access to justice for all, which is a big deal.
It's a big deal, yes.
Let's clap for justice.
(Applause) Here's the scandal, though.
The day the goals were adopted, most of them were accompanied by big commitments: a billion dollars from the Gates Foundation and the British government for nutrition; 25 billion in public-private financing for health care for women and children.
On access to justice, we had the words on the paper, but nobody pledged a penny, and so that is the opportunity and the challenge that we face right now.
The world recognizes more than ever before that you can't have development without justice, that people can't improve their lives if they can't exercise their rights, and what we need to do now is turn that rhetoric, turn that principle, into reality.
(Applause) KK: How can we help?
What can people in this room do?
VM: Great question.
Thank you for asking.
I would say three things.
One is invest.
If you have 10 dollars, or a hundred dollars, a million dollars, consider putting some of it towards grassroots legal empowerment.
It's important in its own right and it's crucial for just about everything else we care about.
Number two, push your politicians and your governments to make this a public priority.
Just like health or education, access to justice should be one of the things that a government owes its people, and we're nowhere close to that, neither in rich countries or poor countries.
Number three is: be a paralegal in your own life.
Find an injustice or a problem where you live.
It's not hard to find, if you look.
Is the river being contaminated, the one that passes through the city where you live?
Are there workers getting paid less than minimum wage or who are working without safety gear?
Get to know the people most affected, find out what the rules say, see if you can use those rules to get a solution.
If it doesn't work, see if you can come together to improve those rules.
Because if we all start knowing law, using law and shaping law, then we will be building that deeper version of democracy that I believe our world desperately needs.
(Applause) KK: Thanks so much, Vivek.
VM: Thank you.I want to tell you about someone.
I'm going to call him Ravi Nanda.
I'm changing his name to protect his safety.
Ravi's from a community of herdspeople in Gujarat on the western coast of India, same place my own family comes from.
When he was 10 years old, his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived.
Then, 20 years later, the same company built a cement factory 100 meters from where they live now.
India has got strong environmental regulations on paper, but this company has violated many of them.
Dust from that factory covers Ravi's mustache and everything he wears.
I spent just two days in his place, and I coughed for a week.
Ravi says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water, they get sick.
He says children now walk long distances with cattle and buffalo to find uncontaminated grazing land.
He says many of those kids have dropped out of school, including three of his own.
Ravi has appealed to the company for years.
He said, "I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with them.
They wouldn't need to buy any wood.
" (Laughter) He said the company ignored every one of those letters, and so in 2013, Ravi Nanda decided to use the last means of protest he thought he had left.
He walked to the gates of that factory with a bucket of petrol in his hands, intending to set himself on fire.
Ravi is not alone in his desperation.
The UN estimates that worldwide, four billion people live without basic access to justice.
These people face grave threats to their safety, their livelihoods, their dignity.
There are almost always laws on the books that would protect these people, but they've often never heard of those laws, and the systems that are supposed to enforce those laws are corrupt or broken or both.
We are living with a global epidemic of injustice, but we've been choosing to ignore it.
Right now, in Sierra Leone, in Cambodia, in Ethiopia, farmers are being cajoled into putting their thumbprints on 50-year lease agreements, signing away all the land they've ever known for a pittance without anybody even explaining the terms.
Governments seem to think that's OK.
Right now, in the United States, in India, in Slovenia, people like Ravi are raising their children in the shadow of factories or mines that are poisoning their air and their water.
There are environmental laws that would protect these people, but many have never seen those laws, let alone having a shot at enforcing them.
And the world seems to have decided that's OK.
What would it take to change that?
Law is supposed to be the language we use to translate our dreams about justice into living institutions that hold us together.
Law is supposed to be the difference between a society ruled by the most powerful and one that honors the dignity of everyone, strong or weak.
That's why I told my grandmother 20 years ago that I wanted to go to law school.
Grandma didn't pause.
She didn't skip a beat.
She said to me, "Lawyer is liar.
" (Laughter) That was discouraging.
(Laughter) But grandma's right, in a way.
Something about law and lawyers has gone wrong.
We lawyers are usually expensive, first of all, and we tend to focus on formal court channels that are impractical for many of the problems people face.
Worse, our profession has shrouded law in a cloak of complexity.
Law is like riot gear on a police officer.
It's intimidating and impenetrable, and it's hard to tell there's something human underneath.
If we're going to make justice a reality for everyone, we need to turn law from an abstraction or a threat into something that every single person can understand, use and shape.
Lawyers are crucial in that fight, no doubt, but we can't leave it to lawyers alone.
In health care, for example, we don't just rely on doctors to serve patients.
We have nurses and midwives and community health workers.
The same should be true of justice.
Community legal workers, sometimes we call them community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, can be a bridge.
These paralegals are from the communities they serve.
They demystify law, break it down into simple terms, and then they help people look for a solution.
They don't focus on the courts alone.
They look everywhere: ministry departments, local government, an ombudsman's office.
Lawyers sometimes say to their clients, "I'll handle it for you.
I've got you.
" Paralegals have a different message, not "I'm going to solve it for you," but "We're going to solve it together, and in the process, we're both going to grow.
" Community paralegals saved my own relationship to law.
After about a year in law school, I almost dropped out.
I was thinking maybe I should have listened to my grandmother.
It was when I started working with paralegals in Sierra Leone, in 2003, that I began feeling hopeful about the law again, and I have been obsessed ever since.
Let me come back to Ravi.
2013, he did reach the gates of that factory with the bucket of petrol in his hands, but he was arrested before he could follow through.
He didn't have to spend long in jail, but he felt completely defeated.
Then, two years later, he met someone.
I'm going to call him Kush.
Kush is part of a team of community paralegals that works for environmental justice on the Gujarat coast.
Kush explained to Ravi that there was law on his side.
Kush translated into Gujarati something Ravi had never seen.
It's called the "consent to operate.
" It's issued by the state government, and it allows the factory to run only if it complies with specific conditions.
So together, they compared the legal requirements with reality, they collected evidence, and they drafted an application -- not to the courts, but to two administrative institutions, the Pollution Control Board and the district administration.
Those applications started turning the creaky wheels of enforcement.
A pollution officer came for a site inspection, and after that, the company started running an air filtration system it was supposed to have been using all along.
It also started covering the 100 trucks that come and go from that plant every day.
Those two measures reduced the air pollution considerably.
The case is far from over, but learning and using law gave Ravi hope.
There are people like Kush walking alongside people like Ravi in many places.
Today, I work with a group called Namati.
Namati helps convene a global network dedicated to legal empowerment.
All together, we are over a thousand organizations in 120 countries.
Collectively, we deploy tens of thousands of community paralegals.
Let me give you another example.
This is Khadija Hamsa.
She is one of five million people in Kenya who faces a discriminatory vetting process when trying to obtain a national ID card.
It is like the Jim Crow South in the United States.
If you are from a certain set of tribes, most of them Muslim, you get sent to a different line.
Without an ID, you can't apply for a job.
You can't get a bank loan.
You can't enroll in university.
You are excluded from society.
Khadija tried off and on to get an ID for eight years, without success.
Then she met a paralegal working in her community named Hassan Kassim.
Hassan explained to Khadija how vetting works, he helped her gather the documents she needed, helped prep her to go before the vetting committee.
Finally, she was able to get an ID with Hassan's help.
In the United States, among many other problems, we have a housing crisis.
In many cities, 90 percent of the landlords in housing court have attorneys, while 90 percent of the tenants do not.
Researchers took a look at 150 cases in which people had help from these paralegals, and they found no evictions at all, not one.
A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way.
I see the beginnings of a real movement, but we're nowhere near what's necessary.
Not yet.
In most countries around the world, governments do not provide a single dollar of support to paralegals like Hassan and Kush.
Most governments don't even recognize the role paralegals play, or protect paralegals from harm.

If you have 10 dollars, or a hundred dollars, a million dollars, consider putting some of it towards grassroots legal empowerment.
Because if we all start knowing law, using law and shaping law, then we will be building that deeper version of democracy that I believe our world desperately needs.
But is it creative? So people came up with as many ideas as they could, and we had to decide: Is this creative or not?
Do you have a memory like that that you can feel in your body right now?
This is the kind of talk that I needed as a girl.
I was extremely sensitive, but by the time I was an adolescent, I had numbed out.
The shame of boys mocking my changing body and then girls exiling me for, ironically, my interest in boys, it was so much.
Girls who were told they were too sensitive, too much.
So I curled up next to her and I drizzled sand on her other arm and then her legs.
And I thought, "Ah.
How many times had I done that -- bathed her and dried her off -- but had I ever stopped and paid attention to the sensations that I was creating for her?
I realized there are parts of the talk that can't be conveyed in words.
"Over to the left, a little harder now.
" How about, "What did you notice about that story?
" "Tell me a moment about your day. What did you learn?
It's what we can learn from our children and it's what we can in turn remind our children as they come of age.
As children, that's how we learn to differentiate ourselves in the world -- through touch.
(Laughter) We teach our children "the talk" about biology and mechanics, about pregnancy and safe sex, and that's what our kids grow up thinking that sex is pretty much all about.
But we can do better than that.
We can teach our sons and daughters about pleasure and desire, about consent and boundaries, about what it feels like to be present in their body and to know when they're not.
And we do that in the ways that we model touch, play, make eye contact -- all the ways that we engage their senses.
We can teach our children not just about sex, but about sensuality.
This is the kind of talk that I needed as a girl.
I was extremely sensitive, but by the time I was an adolescent, I had numbed out.
The shame of boys mocking my changing body and then girls exiling me for, ironically, my interest in boys, it was so much.
And you can't isolate just the difficult feelings, so I lost access to the joy, the pleasure, the play, and I spent decades like that, with this his low-grade depression, thinking that this is what it meant to be a grown-up.
For the past year, I've been interviewing men and women about their relationship to sex and I've heard my story again and again.
Girls who were told they were too sensitive, too much.
Boys who were taught to man up -- "don't be so emotional. " I learned I was not alone in checking out.
It was my daughter who reminded me of how much I used to feel.
We were at the beach.
It was this rare day.
I turned off my cell phone, put in the calendar, "Day at the beach with the girls.
" I laid our towels down just out of reach of the surf and fell asleep.
And when I woke up, I saw my daughter drizzling sand on her arm like this, and I could feel that light tickle of sand on her skin and I remembered my aunt brushing my hair.
So I curled up next to her and I drizzled sand on her other arm and then her legs.
And then I said, "Hey, you want me to bury you?
" And her eyes got really big and she was like, "Yeah!
" So we dug a hole and I covered her in sand and shells and drew this little mermaid tail.
And then I took her home and lathered her up in the shower and massaged her scalp and I dried her off in a towel.
And I thought, "Ah.
How many times had I done that -- bathed her and dried her off -- but had I ever stopped and paid attention to the sensations that I was creating for her?
" I'd been treating her like she was on some assembly line of children needing to be fed and put to bed.
And I realized that when I dry my daughter off in a towel tenderly the way a lover would, I'm teaching her to expect that kind of touch. I'm teaching her in that moment about intimacy. About how to love her body and respect her body.
I realized there are parts of the talk that can't be conveyed in words.
In her book, "Girls and Sex," writer Peggy Orenstein finds that young women are focusing on their partner's pleasure, not their own.
This is something I'm going to talk about with my girls when they're older, but for now, I look for ways to help them identify what gives them pleasure and to practice articulating that.
"Rub my back," my daughter says when I tuck her in. And I say, "OK, how do you want me to rub your back?
" "I don't know," she says. So I pause, waiting for her directions.
Finally she says, "OK, up and to the right, like you're tickling me.
" I run my fingertips up her spine.
"What else?
" I ask.
"Over to the left, a little harder now.
" We need to teach our children how to articulate their sensations so they're familiar with them.
I look for ways to play games with my girls at home to do this.
I scratch my fingernails on my daughter's arm and say, "Give me one word to describe this.
" "Violent," she says.
I embrace her, hold her tight. "Protected," she tells me. I find opportunities to tell them how I'm feeling, what I'm experiencing, so we have common language.
Like right now, this tingling in my scalp down my spine means I'm nervous and I'm excited.
You are likely experiencing sensations in response to me.
The language I'm using, the ideas I'm sharing.
And our tendency is to judge these reactions and sort them into a hierarchy: better or worse, and then seek or avoid them.
And that's because we live in this binary culture and we're taught from a very young age to sort the world into good and bad.
"Did you like that book?
" "Did you have a good day?
" How about, "What did you notice about that story?
" "Tell me a moment about your day. What did you learn?
" Let's teach our children to stay open and curious about their experiences, like a traveler in a foreign land.
And that way they can stay with sensation without checking out -- even the heightened and challenging ones -- the way I did, the way so many of us have.
This sense education, this is education I want for my daughters.
Sense education is what I needed as girl.
It's what I hope for all of our children.
This awareness of sensation, it's where we began as children.
It's what we can learn from our children and it's what we can in turn remind our children as they come of age.
Thank you.
(Applause)
How many of you are tired of seeing celebrities adopting kids from the African continent? (Laughter) Well, it's not all that bad. I was adopted. I grew up in rural Uganda, lost both my parents when I was very, very young.
Hank Willis Thomas: I'm Deb's son. (Laughter) Deborah Willis: And I'm Hank's mom.
HWT: We've said that so many times, we've made a piece about it.
It's called "Sometimes I See Myself In You," and it speaks to the symbiotic relationship that we've developed over the years through our life and work.
And really, it's because everywhere we go, together or apart, we carry these monikers.
I've been following in my mother's footsteps since before I was even born and haven't figured out how to stop.
And as I get older, it does get harder.
No seriously, it gets harder. (Laughter) My mother's taught me many things, though, most of all that love overrules.
She's taught me that love is an action, not a feeling.
Love is a way of being, it's a way of doing, it's a way of listening and it's a way of seeing.
DW: And also, the idea about love, photographers, they're looking for love when they make photographs. They're looking and looking and finding love.
Growing up in North Philadelphia, I was surrounded by people in my family and friends who made photographs and used the family camera as a way of telling a story about life, about life of joy, about what it meant to become a family in North Philadelphia.
No offense to my father, but that's what you get for calling me a "ham" wherever you go.
How old was I when that picture was taken?
Was the world in black and white before I was born?
I grew up in a beauty shop in North Philadelphia, my mom's beauty shop, looking at "Ebony Magazine," found images that told stories that were often not in the daily news, but in the family album.
" DW: While studying in art school -- it's probably true -- I had a male professor who told me that I was taking up a good man's space.
He attempted to shame me in a class full of male photographers.
" You know, I had my camera, and I knew I needed to prove to myself that I would make a difference in photography.
I love photography, and no one is going to stop me from making images.
But I thought about also that black photographers were missing from the history books of photography, and I was looking for ways to tell a story.
They were everywhere, and my mother would turn the kitchen into a darkroom.
And there weren't just pictures that she took and pictures of family members. But there were pictures on the wall of and by people that we didn't know, men and women that we didn't know. Thanks, ma. (Laughter) I have my own timing.
(Laughter) Did you see her poke me?(Laughter) Puppet strings.
When I was nine years old, she published this book, "Black Photographers, 1840-1940: A Bio-Bibliography.
I didn't know how to link the stories, but I knew that teachers needed to know this story. HWT: So I think I was my mother's first student.
Unwillingly and unwittingly -- puppet strings -- I decided to pick up a camera, and thought that I should make my own pictures about the then and now and the now and then.
But through it all, one piece has affected me the most. It continues to nourish me.
You the man.
What a man.
I am many.
DW: Wow, so fascinating.
" And we each have the capacity to love.
It's called "Sometimes I See Myself In You," and it speaks to the symbiotic relationship that we've developed over the years through our life and work.
Growing up in North Philadelphia, I was surrounded by people in my family and friends who made photographs and used the family camera as a way of telling a story about life, about life of joy, about what it meant to become a family in North Philadelphia.
No offense to my father, but that's what you get for calling me a "ham" wherever you go.
I remember whenever I'd go to my grandmother's house, she would hide all the photo albums because she was afraid of me asking, "Well, who is that in that picture?
" and "Who are they to you and who are they to me, and how old were you when that picture was taken?
I grew up in a beauty shop in North Philadelphia, my mom's beauty shop, looking at "Ebony Magazine," found images that told stories that were often not in the daily news, but in the family album.
He tried to stifle my dream of becoming a photographer.
He attempted to shame me in a class full of male photographers.
But I had my camera, and I was determined to prove to him that I was worthy for a seat in that class.
But in retrospect, I asked myself: "Why did I need to prove it to him?
" You know, I had my camera, and I knew I needed to prove to myself that I would make a difference in photography.
I love photography, and no one is going to stop me from making images.
But I thought about also that black photographers were missing from the history books of photography, and I was looking for ways to tell a story.
I grew up in a house full of photographs.
They were everywhere, and my mother would turn the kitchen into a darkroom.
And there weren't just pictures that she took and pictures of family members. But there were pictures on the wall of and by people that we didn't know, men and women that we didn't know. Thanks, ma. (Laughter) I have my own timing.

" And it's astounding to me to consider that in 1840, African Americans were making photographs.
And then I found and I discovered black photographers like Augustus Washington, who made these beautiful daguerreotypes of the McGill family in the early 1840s and '50s.
Their stories tended to be different, black photographers, and they had a different narrative about black life during slavery, but it was also about family life, beauty and telling stories about community.
I didn't know how to link the stories, but I knew that teachers needed to know this story. HWT: So I think I was my mother's first student.
Unwillingly and unwittingly -- puppet strings -- I decided to pick up a camera, and thought that I should make my own pictures about the then and now and the now and then.
I thought about how I could use photography to talk about how what's going on outside of the frame of the camera can affect what we see inside.
The truth is always in the hands of the actual image maker and it's up to us to really consider what's being cut out.
But through it all, one piece has affected me the most. It continues to nourish me.
It's based off of this photograph by Ernest Withers, who took this picture in 1968 at the Memphis Sanitation Workers March of men and women standing collectively to affirm their humanity.
Who's the man.
You the man.
What a man.
I am man.
I am many.
I am, am I. I am, I am. I am, Amen.
DW: Wow, so fascinating.
(Applause) But what we learn from this experience is the most powerful two words in the English language is, "I am.
" And we each have the capacity to love.
Thank you. (Applause)
Shah Rukh Khan: The speaker you are about to meet is someone who knows and understands the value of words like no one else does.
In his writing career spanning over four decades, this man has chosen words with beauty and versatility, like a flower springing to life . . . like Mr.
Bachchan’s memorable punches . . . (Laughter) like a best-selling book of Urdu poetry . . . like well . . . what do I say, only Javed Akhtar Sahab.
(Applause) Please welcome onstage, the one and only Javed Akhtar Sahab.
(Cheers and applause) Javed Akhtar: Friends, this topic -- the power of words -- is an interesting one, and one that's very close to my heart.
It’s strange how we often overlook things that are so close to us, near us. How many people question, "Why is air transparent?
" Or, "Why is water wet?
" How many think about what is it that has passed? Time has passed. What came? What went away?
How many of us wonder? Similarly . . . the words that we speak and hear all day, how many times have we really thought, "What exactly are these words?
" Words are a strange thing.
You once saw an animal and decided it’s a "cat.
" But cat is a sound.
This cat has nothing to do with the animal.
But I have decided it’s a cat.
So a cat it is. So I gave the sound the identity of this animal.
After that I made a semicircle, a pyramid, cut into half, then a straight line, then another below it, and wrote: "cat. " In these criss-crossed lines, I filled a sound and into that sound, a meaning.
Now like with this cat, even with love, anger, a thought, an idea, pain, suffering, happiness, surprise, everything has been linked with a sound.
And then sounds were fit into some criss-crossed lines that we call a script.
So three things that had nothing in common were joined by us to create a word.
A sound that is actually gibberish has been added onto it.
And the lines, crooked lines, they formed a word.
Incredible!
And I have come to believe that with time, these words have become like human beings. A man is known by the company he keeps.
Similarly, with words, what is the company it has been keeping?
What are the other words being used with it?
For an average noun or an average verb, an average mind can quickly create reference.
Where did they hear it?
See it?
What does it remind them of?
What is its connection?
When was it last used in conversation?
What has been my experience with it?
A host of memories appear when you hear a word you remember. And a good writer or orator is one who knows that when he uses a certain word, an average mind will associate it with a certain reference, specific memories will be evoked.
Then he can create a world around a word.
What is the power of a word?
Words are not thoughts, just like bricks are not homes.
But houses are made with bricks.
(Laughter) “You know what I mean,” is running out of words.
Everything is now moving fast so communication has to be fast as well.
But the tragedy is that we have attained this speed at the cost of depth of words.
We want to speak faster, so everything is faster, so the language is also faster, hence communication is faster.
But this speed has affected depth.
Which means that forget about other people, just look at yourself. You are not being able to articulate your own feelings, thoughts or emotions in a detailed manner or clearly.
They reflect your culture, your traditions, your inheritance, your cultural wealth accumulated over generations, all of that is carried forward with words.
But by themselves, they are neither good nor bad. If we start loving words and understand their power, we would realize that everything that happens in the world is because of words.
So we don’t only live on instinct but our slowly accumulated experience and knowledge over generations is passed on to the next. Through what? Through words.
And if we didn’t have that we wouldn’t be here.
Words!
Love them.
Listen to them attentively. And speak attentively.
JA: I was really young then.
(Laughter) SRK: Yes.
Is that what you want?
So we decided to let bygones be bygones and work on some other film.
Hence, the film "Kal Ho Naa Ho. " I told him that everything else is still fine but I owe you two kuchs. Two kuchs.
(Cheers and applause) Javed Akhtar: Friends, this topic -- the power of words -- is an interesting one, and one that's very close to my heart.
How many of us wonder? Similarly . . . the words that we speak and hear all day, how many times have we really thought, "What exactly are these words?

Then he can create a world around a word.
What is the power of a word?
If you have less bricks, you will make a small house.
" No, I don't know what you mean.
(Laughter) “You know what I mean,” is running out of words.
But the tragedy is that we have attained this speed at the cost of depth of words.
We want to speak faster, so everything is faster, so the language is also faster, hence communication is faster.
And these words, as long as words exist, they aren’t there just for a meaning.
They are also a conveyer belt of language, words.
If you cut a man off from some words, you cut him off from a culture, a history.
This is exactly what is happening with us today.
But by themselves, they are neither good nor bad. If we start loving words and understand their power, we would realize that everything that happens in the world is because of words.
Or there would be nothing between us and the rest of the creatures, the rest of the animals, although we too are animals.
And if we didn’t have these words our advantage is gradually over other species would diminish over time.
So learn to respect words.
He sometimes gets angry when unlettered people like us give him suggestions that maybe we could use this word or that instead.
So our film was called "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. " (Cheers) And he did not like the title at all.
So once when he was really mad at us kids, who are like his kids even now, he retorted: "Now my heart remains neither awake nor rests. What do I do? Oh! I feel something strange.
Is that what you want?
" In fact the entire song, all the words, were thrown at us by Javed Sahab in anger.
I felt it wasn’t dignified enough. (Laughter) Though to be honest, I regret leaving such a super hit film over its title.
So I left the film. Later I also felt a little embarrassed, and he too felt bad.
So we decided to let bygones be bygones and work on some other film.
Hence, the film "Kal Ho Naa Ho. " I told him that everything else is still fine but I owe you two kuchs. Two kuchs.
(Laughter) So I’ll write a song and return these two to you.
(Applause)
So there and then, and actually with a lot of encouragement from a couple of TEDsters, I declared my own personal war on superbugs. So let's talk about superbugs for a moment.
This is us here on Earth, this pale blue dot.
And in the same way that global wind patterns here on Earth can be affected by hurricanes, the solar wind is sometimes affected by solar storms that I like to call "space hurricanes.
" When they arrive at planets, they can perturb the space environment, which in turn creates the northern or southern lights, for example, here on Earth, but also Saturn and also Jupiter.
Luckily, here on Earth, we are protected by our planet's natural shield, a magnetic bubble that we call the magnetosphere and that you can see here on the right side.
Nonetheless, solar storms can still be responsible for disrupting satellite telecommunications and operations, for disrupting navigation systems, such as GPS, as well as electric power transmission.
All of these are technologies on which us humans rely more and more.
I mean, imagine if you woke up tomorrow without a working cell phone -- no internet on it, which means no social media.
I mean, to me that would be worse than the zombie apocalypse.
(Laughter) By constantly monitoring the Sun, though, we now know where the solar storms come from.
They come from regions of the Sun where a tremendous amount of energy is being stored.
You have an example here, as a complex structure hanging above the solar surface, just on the verge of erupting.
Unfortunately, we cannot send probes in the scorching hot atmosphere of the Sun, where temperatures can rise up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin.
So what I do is I use computer simulations in order to analyze but also to predict the behavior of these storms when they're just born at the Sun.
This is only one part of the story, though.
When these solar storms are moving in space, some of them will inevitably encounter space probes that we humans have sent in order to explore other worlds.
What I mean by other worlds is, for example, planets, such as Venus or Mercury, but also objects, such as comets.
And while these space probes have been made for different scientific endeavors, they can also act like tiny cosmic meteorological stations and monitor the evolution of these space storms.
So I, with a group of researchers, gather and analyze this data coming from different locations of the Solar System.
And by doing so, my research shows that, actually, solar storms have a generic shape, and that this shape evolves as solar storms move away from the Sun.
And you know what?
This is key for building tools to predict space weather.
I would like to leave you with this beautiful image.
This is us here on Earth, this pale blue dot.
And while I study the Sun and its storms every day, I will always have a deep love for this beautiful planet -- a pale blue dot indeed, but a pale blue dot with an invisible magnetic shield that helps to protect us. Thank you.
(Applause)
Shah Rukh Khan: Be it Mumbai or Delhi, Chennai or Kolkata, all our big cities have one great thing in common, they happily welcome people from smaller places arriving in search of work.
What is also true is that this warm welcome leads to consequences.
Problems like housing in these cities are born.
Today we have with us a human settlement expert and researcher: Dr. Gautam Bhan, who is re-imagining a solution to this increasing problem.
He will share with us the new picture of urban India that he can see.
TED Talks India New Thoughts welcomes Dr. Gautam Bhan. Dr. Gautam Bhan, everyone.
(Applause) Gautam Bhan: In this country, until a few years ago, if you asked someone: "Where are you from?
" Until recently in India, nobody was from a city; people only migrated to the city.
This is changing.
Your parents worked as laborers all day.
Then you too would have come to a city for progress.
One day you go out looking for an accommodation in the city, to buy or maybe just to rent.
The government says we are falling short of at least 20 million homes.
20 million homes, that's 100 million people.
And this is not the shortage of &lt;i&gt;3 BHKs&lt;/i&gt; (bedroom hall kitchen).
Nobody can live without it.
If you couldn't find a home in a city to either buy or rent, you too would be driven to do what most people end up doing.
Make a home wherever possible.
You too would make a &lt;i&gt;settlement.
&lt;/i&gt; The government may keep calling it a &lt;i&gt;slum,&lt;/i&gt; but like the people living there, I too will call it a settlement.
One hundred million are not homeless.
They have homes.
Homes they built on their own.
But most of these homes are in settlements.
This is the truth of an affordable home in India.
The homes in settlements are cheap, but not sturdy. The homes outside are sturdy, but not cheap.
(Applause) We will have to lay the foundation of a new thought from here itself.
A settlement is not a problem; it is a solution.
We just have to make it secure and sturdy.
To fulfill the shortage of 20 million homes you cannot make 20 million 25 square foot flats, and neither should you be making them.
For example take the Karnataka government.
They have a very good record in this.
By 2020, Karnataka needs 2.6 million homes.
In the last ten years they have managed to make 350,000 homes.
Even if a government tries with complete sincerity, it cannot fulfill this need in the next couple of lifetimes.
If we do not make new homes, then what is the next solution?
How to make a settlement secure?
Firstly, eviction needs to be stopped.
Bulldozing needs to be stopped.
Never has that resulted in progress in the past, nor will it in the future.
(Applause) We have to start believing that the laborers who build and run the city have a right over the land of that city.
(Applause) I know you are thinking that settlements are made on illegally captured land, but capturing of land never happens in the dead of the night.
Whether the land belongs to the government or not, a settlement is never formed secretly.
It is inhabited over time.
The government also agrees that the settlements in our cities have been there for over 10, 20, 30, even 40 years.
What kind of illegally captured land is this, which was ignored for 30 years and suddenly a day before eviction is declared illegal?
A settlement can easily accommodate 15 to 60 percent of a city's population by using just one, two or maximum ten percent of the land.
Can such a huge number of people not have a right over this small bit of land?
A city's progress is often measured by the cost of its land.
How do you ascribe a cost to the life of a person living on a piece of land?
A settlement is not asking you for shiny homes; all it's asking for is basic necessities: electricity, roads, water, toilets and drainage.
We call this &lt;i&gt;upgradation.
The government didn't have to build even a single new home.
And every person was given the right to live over that land.
Not the right to sell, but the right to live there, use it, settle on it.
The whole world knows now that to move forward, we cannot remove settlements.
But just one thing. If we know it, then why doesn't it happen?
There is a song. I will not sing it, as I am a terrible singer. GB: I too am a terrible singer.
SRK: But we can't keep shut also, because we are saying wonderful things.
SRK: Only then will life be filled with love and fun times.
(Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gautam Bhan.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)Shah Rukh Khan: Be it Mumbai or Delhi, Chennai or Kolkata, all our big cities have one great thing in common, they happily welcome people from smaller places arriving in search of work.
What is also true is that this warm welcome leads to consequences.

TED Talks India New Thoughts welcomes Dr. Gautam Bhan. Dr. Gautam Bhan, everyone.
(Applause) Gautam Bhan: In this country, until a few years ago, if you asked someone: "Where are you from?
You'd immediately ask again: "Where do you belong?
Urbanization is changing India, but are our cities prepared?
Let's assume you were born somewhere else.
Your parents worked as laborers all day.
One day you go out looking for an accommodation in the city, to buy or maybe just to rent.
If you couldn't find a home in a city to either buy or rent, you too would be driven to do what most people end up doing.
Homes they built on their own.
A settlement is not a problem; it is a solution.
We just have to make it secure and sturdy.
Bulldozing needs to be stopped.
It is inhabited over time.
What kind of illegally captured land is this, which was ignored for 30 years and suddenly a day before eviction is declared illegal?
The whole world knows now that to move forward, we cannot remove settlements.
We can only advance when we think of ways to make settlements secure and sturdy.
Actually I should not be standing here in front of you today.
But if someone like that came here, you wouldn't have listened to him.
You are listening to me, because you think I am not from a settlement.
Thank you.
(Applause) SRK: Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
Please tell me, you just gave an example of Thailand and the big thing there is the homes are for people to settle in, not to sell. They cannot be used for sale.
Is there a similar thought process or program in our country too, inspired by your talks and those of people around you?
GB: I wouldn't say by me, but by the people movement who are fighting for rights in the city. That is making a difference.
For instance, in Odisha the Chief Minister, Mr.
Patnaik, announced the same scheme: that all the people in settlements will have rights over that land.
(Applause) SRK: I too promise I will only say settlements, and not slums, ever again.
There is a song. I will not sing it, as I am a terrible singer. GB: I too am a terrible singer.
At the rate that we're going, we won't be meeting those numbers.
As a surgeon, this is a global issue that bothers me.
It bothers me a lot, because I've seen firsthand how lack of access to safe and affordable healthcare can blight the lives of ordinary people.
If you're a patient that needs an operation and there isn't a surgeon available, you're left with some really difficult choices: to wait, to travel, or not to have an operation at all.
So what's the answer?
Well, part of you are carrying some of that solution with you today: a smartphone, a tablet, a computer.
Because for me, digital communications technology has the power to do so much more than just to allow us to shop online, to connect through social media platforms and to stay up to date.
It has the power to help us solve some of the key issues that we face, like lack of access to vital surgical services.
And today I'd like to share with you an example of how I think we can make that possible.
The history of surgery is filled with breakthroughs in how science and technology was able to help the surgeons of the day face their greatest challenges.
If we go back several hundred years, an understanding of microbiology led to the development of antiseptic techniques, which played a big role in making sure patients were able to stay alive postsurgery.
Fast-forward a few hundred years and we developed keyhole or arthroscopic surgery, which combines video technology and precision instruments to make surgery less invasive.
We call this remote surgery.
It is incumbent on us to find solutions that solve these answers in a cost-effective and scalable way, so that everyone, no matter where they are in the world, can have these problems addressed.
So what if I told you that you didn't really need a million-dollar robot to provide remote surgery?
That all you needed was a phone, a tablet, or a computer, an internet connection, a confident colleague on the ground and one magic ingredient: an augmented reality collaboration software.
Well, enough of me telling you about it.
I'd now like to show you.
We're now going to go live to Dr. Marc Tompkins, an orthopedic surgeon at the University of Minnesota.
He's going to perform an arthroscopic surgery for us, a keyhole surgery of the knee, and I'd like to disclose that this patient has consented to having their operation streamed.
I'd also like to point out that in the interest of time, we're just going to go through the first steps, marking up the patient and just identifying a few key anatomical landmarks.
Hello, Dr. Tompkins, can you hear me? Dr. Mark Tompkins: Good morning, Nadine.
Nadine Hachach-Haram: Everyone from TED says hello.
Audience: Hi.
NHH: Alright, Dr. Tompkins, let's get started.
So let's start with our incisions and where we're going to make these, on either side of the patellar tendon.
So if you can make your incisions there and there, that should hopefully get us into the knee.
MT: All right, I'm going in.
NHH: Great.
So we're just getting inside the joint now.
So why don't we go around and have a quick look at the meniscus.
MT: Perfect.
NHH: Great, so we can see there's a small tear there on the meniscus, but otherwise it looks alright.
And if you turn and head to this direction, follow my finger, let's have a quick look at the ACL and the PCL.
That's your ACL there, that looks quite healthy, no problems there.
So we've just identified that small meniscus tear there, but otherwise the fluid around the joint looks OK as well.
All right, thank you very much, Dr. Tompkins. Thank you for your time.
I'll let you continue.
Have a good day. Bye. (Applause) So I hope through this simple demonstration I was able to illustrate to you just how powerful this technology can be.
And I'd like to point out that I wasn't using any special equipment, just my laptop and a really simple webcam.
We're so used to using digital technology to communicate through voice and text and video, but augmented reality can do something so much deeper.
It allows two people to virtually interact in a way that mimics how they would collaborate in person.
Being able to show someone what you want to do, to illustrate and demonstrate and gesture, is so much more powerful than just telling them.
And it can make for such a great learning tool, because we learn better through direct experience.
So how is this making a difference around the world?
Well, back in my teaching hospital, we've been using this to support local district general hospitals and providing skin cancer surgery and trauma treatment.
Now, patients can access care at a local level.
This reduces their travel time, improves their access, and saves money.
We've even started seeing its use in wound care management with nurses and in outpatient management.
Most recently, and quite exciting, it was used in supporting a surgeon through a cancer removal of a kidney.
And I'd like to just share with you a very quick video here.
I apologize for some of the gruesome views.
(Video) Doctor 1: OK. Show me again.
Doctor 2: If you see here, that's the upper part, the most outer part of your tumor.
Doctor 1: Yes.
Doctor 2: So it's three centimeters deep, so this should be three centimeters.
Doctor 1: Yes, yes.
Doctor 2: OK, so you need to get a 3.5 margin.
Doctor 1: I'm going to show you anyway and tell me what you think about it.
And in this town, there was a hospital with one surgeon working hard to provide this care, Dr. Soraya. Now, Dr.
Soraya was struggling under the sheer demand of her local population, as well as the fact that she wasn't specifically trained in this procedure.
And so, with the help of a charity, we were able to connect her with a cleft surgeon in California, and using this technology, he was able to guide her and her colleagues through the procedure step by step, guiding them, training them and teaching them.
Within a few months, they were able to perform 30 percent more operations with less and less complications.
And now Dr. Soraya and her team can perform these operations independently, competently and confidently.
And I remember one quote from a mother who said, "This technology gave my daughter her smile.
" For me, this is the real power of this technology.
The beauty is that it breaks boundaries. It transcends all technological difficulties.
It connects people.
It democratizes access.
Wi-Fi and mobile technology are growing rapidly, and they should play a role in boosting surgical provision.
We've even seen it used in conflict zones where there's considerable risk in getting specialist surgeons to certain locations.
In a world where there are more mobile devices than there are human beings, it truly has a global reach.
Of course, we've still got a long way before we can solve the problem of getting surgery to five billion people, and unfortunately, some people still don't have access to internet.
But things are rapidly moving in the right direction.
The potential for change is there.
My team and I are growing our global footprint, and we're starting to see the potential of this technology.
Through digital technology, through simple, everyday devices that we take for granted, through devices of the future, we can really do miraculous things. Thank you.
(Applause)
As an actor, I get scripts and it's my job to stay on script, to say my lines and bring to life a character that someone else wrote.
Over the course of my career, I've had the great honor playing some of the greatest male role models ever represented on television.
You might recognize me as "Male Escort #1." (Laughter) "Photographer Date Rapist," "Shirtless Date Rapist" from the award-winning "Spring Break Shark Attack.
" (Laughter) "Shirtless Medical Student," "Shirtless Steroid-Using Con Man" and, in my most well-known role, as Rafael.
(Applause) A brooding, reformed playboy who falls for, of all things, a virgin, and who is only occasionally shirtless.
(Laughter) Now, these roles don't represent the kind of man I am in my real life, but that's what I love about acting.
I get to live inside characters very different than myself.
But every time I got one of these roles, I was surprised, because most of the men I play ooze machismo, charisma and power, and when I look in the mirror, that's just not how I see myself.
But it was how Hollywood saw me, and over time, I noticed a parallel between the roles I would play as a man both on-screen and off.
I think for the most part I've just been kind of putting on a show, but I'm tired of performing.
Now -- right?
Right?
Girls are weak, and boys are strong.
This is what's being subconsciously communicated to hundreds of millions of young boys and girls all over the world, just like it was with me.
We likely all know how we got here, OK?
And I believe the only way that can happen is if men learn to not only embrace the qualities that we were told are feminine in ourselves but to be willing to stand up, to champion and learn from the women who embody them.
Now, men -- (Laughter) I am not saying that everything we have learned is toxic.
I'm not saying there's anything inherently wrong with you or me, and men, I'm not saying we have to stop being men.
So speaking of scripts, the first script I ever got came from my dad.
He's loving, he's kind, he's sensitive, he's nurturing, he's here.
(Applause) He's crying.
But when I did, something amazing happened.
I realized that I wasn't alone, because my guys had also been struggling.
(Laughter) This is real.
I loved this experience, because it showed me that transformation is possible, even over direct messages.
Growing up, we tend to challenge each other. We've got to be the toughest, the strongest, the bravest men that we can be.
And for many of us, myself included, our identities are wrapped up in whether or not at the end of the day we feel like we're man enough.
But I've got a challenge for all the guys, because men love challenges.
(Laughter) I challenge you to see if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper into yourself.
Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Can we redefine what those mean and use them to explore our hearts?
Are you brave enough to be vulnerable?
To reach out to another man when you need help?
To dive headfirst into your shame?
Are you strong enough to be sensitive, to cry whether you are hurting or you're happy, even if it makes you look weak?
Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life? To hear their ideas and their solutions? To hold their anguish and actually believe them, even if what they're saying is against you?
And will you be man enough to stand up to other men when you hear "locker room talk," when you hear stories of sexual harassment?
When you hear your boys talking about grabbing ass or getting her drunk, will you actually stand up and do something so that one day we don't have to live in a world where a woman has to risk everything and come forward to say the words "me too?
" (Applause) This is serious stuff.
I've had to take a real, honest look at the ways that I've unconsciously been hurting the women in my life, and it's ugly.
My wife told me that I had been acting in a certain way that hurt her and not correcting it.
Basically, sometimes when she would go to speak, at home or in public, I would just cut her off mid-sentence and finish her thought for her.
It's awful.
The worst part was that I was completely unaware when I was doing it.
It was unconscious.
So here I am doing my part, trying to be a feminist, amplifying the voices of women around the world, and yet at home, I am using my louder voice to silence the woman I love the most.
So I had to ask myself a tough question: am I man enough to just shut the hell up and listen?
(Laughter) (Applause) I've got to be honest.
I wish that didn't get an applause.
(Laughter) Guys, this is real.
And I'm just scratching the surface here, because the deeper we go, the uglier it gets, I guarantee you.
I don't have time to get into porn and violence against women or the split of domestic duties or the gender pay gap.
But I believe that as men, it's time we start to see past our privilege and recognize that we are not just part of the problem.
Fellas, we are the problem.
The glass ceiling exists because we put it there, and if we want to be a part of the solution, then words are no longer enough.
There's a quote that I love that I grew up with from the Bahá'í writings.
It says that "the world of humanity is possessed of two wings, the male and the female.
So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength, the bird will not fly.
" So women, on behalf of men all over the world who feel similar to me, please forgive us for all the ways that we have not relied on your strength.
And now I would like to ask you to formally help us, because we cannot do this alone.
We are men.
We're going to mess up.
We're going to say the wrong thing.
We're going to be tone-deaf.
We're more than likely, probably, going to offend you.
But don't lose hope.
We're only here because of you, and like you, as men, we need to stand up and become your allies as you fight against pretty much everything.
We need your help in celebrating our vulnerability and being patient with us as we make this very, very long journey from our heads to our hearts.
And finally to parents: instead of teaching our children to be brave boys or pretty girls, can we maybe just teach them how to be good humans?
So back to my dad.
Growing up, yeah, like every boy, I had my fair share of issues, but now I realize that it was even thanks to his sensitivity and emotional intelligence that I am able to stand here right now talking to you in the first place.
The resentment I had for my dad I now realize had nothing to do with him.
It had everything to do with me and my longing to be accepted and to play a role that was never meant for me.
So while my dad may have not taught me how to use my hands, he did teach me how to use my heart, and to me that makes him more a man than anything.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a professional troublemaker.
(Laughter) As my job is to critique the world, the shoddy systems and the people who refuse to do better, as a writer, as a speaker, as a shady Nigerian -- (Laughter) I feel like my purpose is to be this cat.
(Laughter) I am the person who is looking at other people, like, "I need you to fix it.
" That is me.
I want us to leave this world better than we found it.
And how I choose to effect change is by speaking up, by being the first and by being the domino.
For a line of dominoes to fall, one has to fall first, which then leaves the other choiceless to do the same.
And that domino that falls, we're hoping that, OK, the next person that sees this is inspired to be a domino.
Being the domino, for me, looks like speaking up and doing the things that are really difficult, especially when they are needed, with the hope that others will follow suit.
And here's the thing: I'm the person who says what you might be thinking but dared not to say.
A lot of times people think that we're fearless, the people who do this, we're fearless.
We're not fearless.
We're not unafraid of the consequences or the sacrifices that we have to make by speaking truth to power.
What happens is, we feel like we have to, because there are too few people in the world willing to be the domino, too few people willing to take that fall.
We're not doing it without fear.
Now, let's talk about fear.
I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up.
I was like, "I'm going to be a doctor!
" Doctor Luvvie was the dream.
I was Doc McStuffins before it was a thing.
(Laughter) And I remember when I went to college, my freshman year, I had to take Chemistry 101 for my premed major.
I got the first and last D of my academic career.
(Laughter) So I went to my advisor, and I was like, "OK, let's drop the premed, because this doctor thing is not going to work, because I don't even like hospitals.
So . . . " (Laughter) "Let's just consider that done for.
" And that same semester, I started blogging.
That was 2003. So as that one dream was ending, another was beginning.
And then what was a cute hobby became my full-time job when I lost my marketing job in 2010. But it still took me two more years to say, "I'm a writer.
" Nine years after I had started writing, before I said, "I'm a writer," because I was afraid of what happens without 401ks, without, "How am I going to keep up my shoe habit?
That's important to me.
" (Laughter) So it took me that long to own this thing that was what my purpose was.
And then I realized, fear has a very concrete power of keeping us from doing and saying the things that are our purpose.
And I was like, "You know what?
I'm not going to let fear rule my life.
I'm not going to let fear dictate what I do.
" And then all of these awesome things started happening, and dominoes started to fall.
So when I realized that, I was like, "OK, 2015, I turned 30, it's going to be my year of 'Do it anyway.
' Anything that scares me, I'm going to actively pursue it.
" So, I'm a Capricorn.
I like my feel solidly on the ground.
I decided to take my first-ever solo vacation, and it was out of the country to the Dominican Republic.
So on my birthday, what did I do?
I went ziplining through the forests of Punta Cana.
And for some odd reason, I had on business casual.
Don't ask why.
(Laughter) And I had an incredible time.
Also, I don't like being submerged in water.
I like to be, again, on solid ground.
So I went to Mexico and swam with dolphins underwater.
We're about to fall out of the plane.
I was like, "I've done some stupid things in life.
This is one of them.
" (Laughter) And then we come falling down to Earth, and I literally lose my breath as I see Earth, and I was like, "I just fell out of a perfectly good plane on purpose.
" (Laughter) "What is wrong with me? !
" But then I looked down at the beauty, and I was like, "This is the best thing I could have done.
This was an amazing decision.
" And I think about the times when I have to speak truth. It feels like I am falling out of that plane.
It feels like that moment when I'm at the edge of the plane, and I'm like, "You shouldn't do this," but then I do it anyway, because I realize I have to.
Sitting at the edge of that plane and kind of staying on that plane is comfort to me.
And I feel like every day that I'm speaking truth against institutions and people who are bigger than me and just forces that are more powerful than me, I feel like I'm falling out of that plane.
But I realize comfort is overrated.
Because being quiet is comfortable.
Keeping things the way they've been is comfortable.
And all comfort has done is maintain the status quo.
So we've got to get comfortable with being uncomfortable by speaking these hard truths when they're necessary.
And I -- (Applause) And for me, though, I realize that I have to speak these truths, because honesty is so important to me.
My integrity is something I hold dear.
Justice -- I don't think justice should be an option.
We should always have justice.
Also, I believe in shea butter as a core value, and -- (Laughter) and I think the world would be better if we were more moisturized.
But besides that, with these as my core values, I have to speak the truth.
I have no other choice in the matter.
But people like me, the professional troublemakers, should not be the only ones who are committed to being these dominoes who are always falling out of planes or being the first one to take this hit.
People are so afraid of these acute consequences, not realizing that there are many times when we walk in rooms and we are some of the most powerful people in those rooms -- we might be the second-most powerful, third-most powerful.
And I firmly believe that our job in those times is to disrupt what is happening.
And then if we're not the most powerful, if two more of us band together, it makes us powerful.
It's like cosigning the woman in the meeting, you know, the woman who can't seem to get her word out, or just making sure that other person who can't make a point is being heard.
Our job is to make sure they have room for that.
Everyone's well-being is community business.
If we made that a point, we'd understand that, for the times when we need help, we wouldn't have to look around so hard if we made sure we were somebody else's help.
And there are times when I feel like I have taken very public tumbles and falls, like the time when I was asked to speak at a conference, and they wanted me to pay my way there.
And then I did some research and found out the white men who spoke there got compensated and got their travel paid for.
The white women who spoke there got their travel paid for.
The black women who spoke there were expected to actually pay to speak there.
And I was like, "What do I do?
" And I knew that if I spoke up about this publicly, I could face financial loss.
But then I also understood that my silence serves no one.
So I fearfully spoke up about it publicly, and other women started coming out to talk about, "I, too, have faced this type of pay inequality.
" And it started a conversation about discriminatory pay practices that this conference was participating in.
I felt like I was the domino the time I read a disturbing memoir by a public figure and wrote a piece about it.
I knew this person was more powerful than me and could impact my career, but I was like, "I've got to do this. I've got to sit at the edge of this plane," maybe for two hours.
And I did.
And I pressed "Publish," and I ran away.
(Laughter) And I came back to a viral post and people being like, "Oh my God, I'm so glad somebody finally said this.
" And it started a conversation about mental health and self-care, and I was like, "OK. Alright. This thing that I'm doing, I guess, alright, it's doing something.
" And then so many people have been the domino when they talk about how they've been assaulted by powerful men.
And it's made millions of women join in and say, "Me Too.
" So, a shout-out to Tarana Burke for igniting that movement.
(Applause) People and systems count on our silence to keep us exactly where we are.
Now, being the domino sometimes comes down to being exactly who you are.
So, I've been a shady somebody since I was three.
(Laughter) This is me on my third birthday.
(Applause) When it's time to say these hard things, I ask myself three things.
One: Did you mean it?
Two: Can you defend it?
Three: Did you say it with love?
If the answer is yes to all three, I say it and let the chips fall.
That's important.
That checkpoint with myself always tells me, "Yes, you're supposed to do this.
" Telling the truth -- telling thoughtful truths -- should not be a revolutionary act.
Speaking truths to power should not be sacrificial, but they are.
But I think if more of us chose to do this for the greater good, we'd be in better spaces than we are right now.
Speaking of the greater good, I think we commit ourselves to telling truths to build bridges to common ground, and bridges that aren't based on truth will collapse.
So it is our job, it is our obligation, it is our duty to speak truth to power, to be the domino, not just when it's difficult -- especially when it's difficult.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Most people think that new technology or advanced technology can never start in Africa.
Instead, they think that the best way to help the continent advance is by providing aid or services that the continent can't provide for itself.
So while we see advanced technology like robotics and artificial intelligence growing exponentially in the developed world, those same people are worried that a technologically backward Africa is falling behind.
That attitude couldn't be more wrong.
I'm a robotics entrepreneur who's spent a lot of time here in Africa.
And in 2014 we created Zipline, which is a company that uses electric autonomous aircraft to deliver medicine to hospitals and health centers on demand.
Last year, we launched the world's first automated delivery system operating at national scale.
And guess what?
We did not do that in the US, we didn't do it in Japan, and we didn't do it in Europe.
It was actually President Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Ministry of Health that made a big bet on the potential of this technology and signed a commercial contract to deliver a majority of the country's blood on demand.
(Applause) Yeah, they deserve the applause.
So why is blood important?
Rwanda collects between 60- and 80,000 units of blood a year.
So this is a product that when you need it, you really, really need it.
But blood is also challenging, because it has a very short shelf life, there are lots of different storage requirements, and it's really hard to predict the demand for all of these different blood groups before a patient actually needs something.
But the cool thing is that using this technology, Rwanda has been able to keep more blood centralized and then provide it when a patient needs something to any hospital or health center in an average of just 20 or 30 minutes.
Do you guys want to see how it works?
(Audience) Yes.
All right.
Nobody believes me, so . . . better to show.
This is our distribution center, which is about 20 kilometers outside of Kigali.
This actually used to be a cornfield nine months ago, and with the Rwandan government, we leveled it and built this center in a couple weeks.
So when a patient is having an emergency, a doctor or a nurse at that hospital can send us a WhatsApp, telling us what they need.
And then our team will immediately spring into action.
And then once that Zip is ready to go, we accelerate it from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in about half of a second.
(Audience) Whoa!
And from the moment it leaves the end of the launcher, it's completely autonomous.
(Video: Air traffic controller directs traffic) This is our air traffic controller calling it in to Kigali International Airport.
And when the Zip arrives at the hospital, it descends to about 30 feet and drops the package.
We use a really simple paper parachute -- simple things are best -- that allows the package to come to the ground gently and reliably in the same place every time.
So it's just like ride sharing; the doctors get a text message one minute before we arrive, saying, "Walk outside and receive your delivery.
" (Laughter) And then -- (Applause) and then the doctors have what they need to save a patient's life.
This is actually watching a delivery happen from our distribution center; this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away.
We're able to watch the vehicle as it makes a delivery at a hospital in real time.
You may have noticed there are pings that are coming off of that vehicle on the screen.
Those pings are actually data packets that we're getting over the cell phone networks.
So these planes have SIM cards just like your cell phone does, and they're communicating over the cell network to tell us where they are and how they're doing at all times.
Believe it or not, we actually buy family plans -- (Laughter) for this fleet of vehicles, because that's how we get the best rates.
(Laughter) It's actually not a joke.
(Laughter) So today, we're delivering about 20 percent of the national blood supply of Rwanda outside of Kigali.
We serve about 12 hospitals, and we're adding hospitals to that network at an accelerating rate.
All of those hospitals only receive blood in this way, and most of those hospitals actually place multiple orders every day.
So the reason -- in all of health care logistics, you're always trading off waste against access.
So if you want to solve waste, you keep everything centralized.
As a result, when patients are having emergencies, sometimes they don't have the medical product they need.
If you want to solve access, you stock a lot of medicine at the last mile, at hospitals or health centers, and then patients have the medicine they need.
But you end up throwing a lot of medicine out, which is very expensive.
What's so amazing is that the Rwandan government has been able to break this cycle permanently.
Because doctors can get what they need instantly, they actually stock less blood at the hospitals.
So although use of blood products has increased substantially at all the hospitals we serve, in the last nine months, zero units of blood have expired at any of these hospitals.
(Applause) That's an amazing result.
That's actually not been achieved by any other health care system on the planet, and it happened here.
But obviously, when we're talking about delivering medical products instantly, the most important thing is patients.
Let me give you an example.
A couple months ago, a 24-year-old mother came into one of the hospitals that we serve, and she gave birth via C-section.
But that led to complications, and she started to bleed.
Luckily, the doctors had some blood of her blood type on hand that had been delivered via Zipline's routine service, and so they transfused her with a couple units of blood.
But she bled out of those units in about 10 minutes.
In this case, that mother's life is in grave danger -- in any hospital in the world.
But luckily, the doctors who were taking care of her immediately called our distribution center, they placed an emergency order, and our team actually did emergency delivery after emergency delivery after emergency delivery.
They ended up sending seven units of red blood cells, four units of plasma and two units of platelets.
That's more blood than you have in your entire body.
All of it was transfused into her, the doctors were able to stabilize her, and she is healthy today.
(Applause) Since we launched, we've done about 400 emergency deliveries like that, and there's a story like that one behind most of those emergencies.
Here are just a couple of the moms who have received transfusions in this way in the last couple months.
We're always reminded: when we can help a doctor save a mom's life, it's not just her life that you're saving.
That's also a baby boy or a baby girl who has a mother while they're growing up.
(Applause) But I want to be clear: postpartum hemorrhaging -- it's not a Rwanda problem, it's not a developing-world problem -- this is a global problem.
Maternal health is a challenge everywhere.
The main difference is that Rwanda was the first country to use radical technology to do something about it.
And that's the reason this attitude of Africa being disrupted or advanced technology not working here or needing aid is so totally wrong.
Africa can be the disrupter.
These small, agile, developing economies can out-innovate large, rich ones.
And they can totally leapfrog over the absence of legacy infrastructure to go straight to newer and better systems.
In 2000, if you had said that high-quality cellular networks were about to roll out across all of Africa, people would have told you that you were crazy.
And yet, no one anticipated how fast those networks were going to connect and empower people.
Today, 44 percent of the GDP of Kenya flows through M-Pesa, their mobile payment platform.
And not only that, but our autonomous fleet of vehicles relies on that cellular network.
Over the next few years as we start serving private health care facilities, we'll also use that mobile payment platform to collect fees for deliveries.
So innovation leads to more innovation leads to more innovation.
And meanwhile, most people who live in developed economies think that drone delivery is technologically impossible, let alone happening at national scale in East Africa.
And I do mean East Africa, not just Rwanda.
On Thursday, just a couple days ago, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health announced that they are going to use this same technology to provide instant delivery of a wide range of medical products to 10 million of the hardest to reach people in the country.
(Applause) It's actually going to be the largest autonomous system anywhere in the world.
To give you a sense of what this looks like, this is one of the first distribution centers.
You can see a 75-kilometer service radius around the distribution center, and that allows us to serve hundreds of health facilities and hospitals, all of which are rural, from that single distribution center.
But to serve over 20 percent of the population of Tanzania, we're going to need multiple distribution centers.
We'll actually need four.
And from these distribution centers, we expect to be doing several hundred lifesaving deliveries every day, and this system will ultimately serve over 1,000 health facilities and hospitals in the country.
So yeah, East Africa is moving really fast.
One thing that people, I think, often miss is that these kinds of leaps generate compounding gains.
For example, Rwanda, by investing in this infrastructure for health care, now has an aerial logistics network that they can use to catalyze other parts of their economy, like agriculture or e-commerce. Even more importantly, 100 percent of the teams we hire at these distribution centers are local.
So here's our Rwandan team, which is a group of extraordinary engineers and operators.
They run the world's only automated delivery system operating at national scale.
They have been able to master something that the largest technology companies in the world have not yet been able to figure out.
So they are total heroes.
(Applause) They're total heroes.
Our team's mission is to deliver basic access to medicine to all seven billion people on the planet, no matter how hard it is to reach them.
We often tell people about that mission, and they say, "That's so generous of you, it's so philanthropic.
" No!
Philanthropy has nothing to do with it.
And the jobs that these kids may have gotten 10 years ago are largely being automated or are being changed dramatically by technology.
So they are looking for new skill sets, new competitive advantages.
They're looking for start-ups.
So why aren't there more start-ups that are tackling these global problems that are faced by billions of people in developing economies?
The reason is that investors and entrepreneurs are totally blind to the opportunity.
We think these problems are the domain of NGOs or governments, not private companies.
That's what we have to change.
You may have noticed I left something out of the video that I showed you.
I didn't show you how the planes land when they get back to the distribution center.
So, it might be obvious to you: none of our planes have landing gear.
We also don't have runways where we operate.
So we have to be able to decelerate the plane from about 100 kilometers an hour to zero in half of a second.
And the way we do that is we actually use a wire that tracks that plane as it comes in, with centimeter-level accuracy.
We snag the plane out of the sky, and then we gently plop it onto an actively inflated cushion.
This is basically a combination of an aircraft carrier and a bouncy castle. (Laughter) So let me show you.
(Laughter) (Applause) And it might be obvious to you why I wanted to end with this video.
I wanted to show you the kids and the teenagers who line up on the fence every day.
They cheer every launch and every landing.
(Laughter) (Applause) Sometimes I actually show up at the distribution center early because I'm jet-lagged.
I'll show up an hour before we begin operation.
And there will be kids on the fence getting good seats.
(Laughter) And you go up and you ask them, "What do you think about the planes?
" And they'll say, "Oh, it's a sky ambulance.
" So they get it.
I mean, they get it more than most adults.
So I was asking earlier: Who is going to be creating the disruptive technology companies of Africa over the next decade?
Ultimately, it's going to be up to these kids.
They are the engineers of Rwanda and Africa.
They are the engineers of our shared future.
But the only way they can build that future is if we realize that world-changing companies can scale in Africa, and that disruptive technology can start here first. Thanks. (Applause)
Where does the end begin?
Well, for me, it all began with this little fellow.
This adorable organism -- well, I think it's adorable -- is called Tetrahymena and it's a single-celled creature.
It's also been known as pond scum.
So that's right, my career started with pond scum.
Now, it was no surprise I became a scientist.
Growing up far away from here, as a little girl I was deadly curious about everything alive.
I used to pick up lethally poisonous stinging jellyfish and sing to them.
And so starting my career, I was deadly curious about fundamental mysteries of the most basic building blocks of life, and I was fortunate to live in a society where that curiosity was valued.
Now, for me, this little pond scum critter Tetrahymena was a great way to study the fundamental mystery I was most curious about: those bundles of DNA in our cells called chromosomes.
And it was because I was curious about the very ends of chromosomes, known as telomeres.
Now, when I started my quest, all we knew was that they helped protect the ends of chromosomes.
It was important when cells divide.
It was really important, but I wanted to find out what telomeres consisted of, and for that, I needed a lot of them.
And it so happens that cute little Tetrahymena has a lot of short linear chromosomes, around 20,000, so lots of telomeres.
And I discovered that telomeres consisted of special segments of noncoding DNA right at the very ends of chromosomes.
But here's a problem.
Now, we all start life as a single cell.
It multiples to two.
Two becomes four.
Four becomes eight, and on and on to form the 200 million billion cells that make up our adult body.
And some of those cells have to divide thousands of times.
In fact, even as I stand here before you, all throughout my body, cells are furiously replenishing to, well, keep me standing here before you.
But there is a glitch in the way DNA is copied. It is just one of those facts of life.
Every time the cell divides and the DNA is copied, some of that DNA from the ends gets worn down and shortened, some of that telomere DNA.
And think about it like the protective caps at the ends of your shoelace.
And those keep the shoelace, or the chromosome, from fraying, and when that tip gets too short, it falls off, and that worn down telomere sends a signal to the cells.
"The DNA is no longer being protected.
" It sends a signal.
Time to die.
So, end of story.
Well, sorry, not so fast.
It can't be the end of the story, because life hasn't died off the face of the earth.
So I was curious: if such wear and tear is inevitable, how on earth does Mother Nature make sure we can keep our chromosomes intact?
Now, remember that little pond scum critter Tetrahymena?
The craziest thing was, Tetrahymena cells never got old and died.
Their telomeres weren't shortening as time marched on.
Sometimes they even got longer.
Something else was at work, and believe me, that something was not in any textbook.
So working in my lab with my extraordinary student Carol Greider -- and Carol and I shared the Nobel Prize for this work -- we began running experiments and we discovered cells do have something else.
It was a previously undreamed-of enzyme that could replenish, make longer, telomeres, and we named it telomerase. And when we removed our pond scum's telomerase, their telomeres ran down and they died.
So it was thanks to their plentiful telomerase that our pond scum critters never got old.
OK, now, that's an incredibly hopeful message for us humans to be receiving from pond scum, because it turns out that as we humans age, our telomeres do shorten, and remarkably, that shortening is aging us.
Generally speaking, the longer your telomeres, the better off you are.
It's the overshortening of telomeres that leads us to feel and see signs of aging.
My skin cells start to die and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles.
Hair pigment cells die.
You start to see gray.
Immune system cells die.
You increase your risks of getting sick.
In fact, the cumulative research from the last 20 years has made clear that telomere attrition is contributing to our risks of getting cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes, the very conditions many of us die of.
And so we have to think about this.
What is going on?
This attrition, we look and we feel older, yeah.
Our telomeres are losing the war of attrition faster.
And those of us who feel youthful longer, it turns out our telomeres are staying longer for longer periods of time, extending our feelings of youthfulness and reducing the risks of all we most dread as the birthdays go by.
OK, seems like a no-brainer.
Great!
Problem solved.
(Applause) Not so fast, I'm sorry.
Alas, that's not the case. OK. And why?
It's because human genetics has taught us that when it comes to our telomerase, we humans live on a knife edge.
OK, simply put, yes, nudging up telomerase does decrease the risks of some diseases, but it also increases the risks of certain and rather nasty cancers.
So even if you could buy that Costco-sized bottle of telomerase, and there are many websites marketing such dubious products, the problem is you could nudge up your risks of cancers.
And we don't want that.
It isn't about enormously extending human lifespan or immortality.
It's about health span.
Now, health span is the number of years of your life when you're free of disease, you're healthy, you're productive, you're zestfully enjoying life.
Disease span, the opposite of health span, is the time of your life spent feeling old and sick and dying.
So the real question becomes, OK, if I can't guzzle telomerase, do I have control over my telomeres' length and hence my well-being, my health, without those downsides of cancer risks?
OK?
So, it's the year 2000. Now, I've been minutely scrutinizing little teeny tiny telomeres very happily for many years, when into my lab walks a psychologist named Elissa Epel.
Now, Elissa's expertise is in the effects of severe, chronic psychological stress on our mind's and our body's health.
And there she was standing in my lab, which ironically overlooked the entrance to a mortuary, and -- (Laughter) And she had a life-and-death question for me.
"What happens to telomeres in people who are chronically stressed?
" she asked me.
You see, she'd been studying caregivers, and specifically mothers of children with a chronic condition, be it gut disorder, be it autism, you name it -- a group obviously under enormous and prolonged psychological stress.
I have to say, her question changed me profoundly.
See, all this time I had been thinking of telomeres as those miniscule molecular structures that they are, and the genes that control telomeres. And when Elissa asked me about studying caregivers, I suddenly saw telomeres in a whole new light.
I saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes into the lives of the real people we were studying.
And I'm a mom myself, and at that moment, I was struck by the image of these women dealing with a child with a condition very difficult to deal with, often without help.
And such women, simply, often look worn down.
So was it possible their telomeres were worn down as well?
So our collective curiosity went into overdrive.
Elissa selected for our first study a group of such caregiving mothers, and we wanted to ask: What's the length of their telomeres compared with the number of years that they have been caregiving for their child with a chronic condition?
So four years go by and the day comes when all the results are in, and Elissa looked down at our first scatterplot and literally gasped, because there was a pattern to the data, and it was the exact gradient that we most feared might exist.
It was right there on the page.
The longer, the more years that is, the mother had been in this caregiving situation, no matter her age, the shorter were her telomeres.
And the more she perceived her situation as being more stressful, the lower was her telomerase and the shorter were her telomeres.
So we had discovered something unheard of: the more chronic stress you are under, the shorter your telomeres, meaning the more likely you were to fall victim to an early disease span and perhaps untimely death.
Our findings meant that people's life events and the way we respond to these events can change how you maintain your telomeres.
So telomere length wasn't just a matter of age counted in years.
Elissa's question to me, back when she first came to my lab, indeed had been a life-and-death question.
Now, luckily, hidden in that data there was hope.
We noticed that some mothers, despite having been carefully caring for their children for many years, had been able to maintain their telomeres.
So studying these women closely revealed that they were resilient to stress.
Somehow they were able to experience their circumstances not as a threat day in and day out but as a challenge, and this has led to a very important insight for all of us: we have control over the way we age all the way down into our cells.
OK, now our initial curiosity became infectious.
Thousands of scientists from different fields added their expertise to telomere research, and the findings have poured in.
It's up to over 10,000 scientific papers and counting.
So several studies rapidly confirmed our initial finding that yes, chronic stress is bad for telomeres.
Attitude matters.
Not good for your telomeres.
On the other hand, if you typically see something stressful as a challenge to be tackled, then blood flows to your heart and to your brain, and you experience a brief but energizing spike of cortisol.
And thanks to that habitual "bring it on" attitude, your telomeres do just fine.
So . . . What is all of this telling us?
Your telomeres do just fine.
You really do have power to change what is happening to your own telomeres.
But our curiosity just got more and more intense, because we started to wonder, what about factors outside our own skin?
Could they impact our telomere maintenance as well?
You know, we humans are intensely social beings.
Was it even possible that our telomeres were social as well?
And the results have been startling. As early as childhood, emotional neglect, exposure to violence, bullying and racism all impact your telomeres, and the effects are long-term.
Can you imagine the impact on children of living years in a war zone?
People who can't trust their neighbors and who don't feel safe in their neighborhoods consistently have shorter telomeres.
So your home address matters for telomeres as well.
On the flip side, tight-knit communities, being in a marriage long-term, and lifelong friendships, even, all improve telomere maintenance.
So what is all this telling us?
It's telling us that I have the power to impact my own telomeres, and I also have the power to impact yours.
Telomere science has told us just how interconnected we all are.
But I'm still curious.
I do wonder what legacy all of us will leave for the next generation?
Will we invest in the next young woman or man peering through a microscope at the next little critter, the next bit of pond scum, curious about a question we don't even know today is a question?
It could be a great question that could impact all the world.
And maybe, maybe you're curious about you.
Now that you know how to protect your telomeres, are you curious what are you going to do with all those decades of brimming good health?
And now that you know you could impact the telomeres of others, are you curious how will you make a difference?
And now that you know the power of curiosity to change the world, how will you make sure that the world invests in curiosity for the sake of the generations that will come after us?
Thank you.
(Applause)
I've been doing some thinking.
I'm going to kill my dad.
I called my sister.
"Listen, I've been doing some thinking.
I'm going to kill Dad.
I'm going to take him to Oregon, find some heroin, and give it to him.
" My dad has frontotemporal lobe dementia, or FTD.
It's a confusing disease that hits people in their 50s or 60s.
It can completely change someone's personality, making them paranoid and even violent.
My dad's been sick for a decade, but three years ago he got really sick, and we had to move him out of his house -- the house that I grew up in, the house that he built with his own hands.
My strapping, cool dad with the falsetto singing voice had to move into a facility for round-the-clock care when he was just 65. At first my mom and sisters and I made the mistake of putting him in a regular nursing home.
It was really pretty; it had plush carpet and afternoon art classes and a dog named Diane.
But then I got a phone call. "Ms. Malone, we've arrested your father.
" "What?
" "Well, he threatened everybody with cutlery. And then he yanked the curtains off the wall, and then he tried to throw plants out the window.
And then, well, he pulled all the old ladies out of their wheelchairs.
" "All the old ladies?
" (Laughter) "What a cowboy.
" (Laughter) After he got kicked out of there, we bounced him between a bunch of state-run facilities before finding a treatment center specifically for people with dementia.
At first, he kind of liked it, but over time his health declined, and one day I walked in and found him sitting hunched over on the ground wearing a onesie -- those kinds of outfits that zip in the back.
I watched him for about an hour as he yanked at it, trying to find a way out of this thing.
And it's supposed to be practical, but to me it looked like a straightjacket.
And so I ran out. I left him there.
I sat in my truck -- his old truck -- hunched over, this really deep guttural cry coming out of the pit of my belly.
I just couldn't believe that my father, the Adonis of my youth, my really dear friend, would think that this kind of life was worth living anymore.
We're programmed to prioritize productivity.
So when a person -- an Adonis in this case -- is no longer productive in the way we expect him to be, the way that he expects himself to be, what value does that life have left?
That day in the truck, all I could imagine was that my dad was being tortured and his body was the vessel of that torture.
I've got to get him out of that body. I've got to get him out of that body; I'm going to kill Dad.
I call my sister.
"Beth," she said.
"You don't want to live the rest of your life knowing that you killed your father.
And you'd be arrested I think, because he can't condone it.
And you don't even know how to buy heroin.
" (Laughter) It's true, I don't.
(Laughter) The truth is we talk about his death a lot.
When will it happen?
What will it be like?
But I wish that we would have talked about death when we were all healthy.
What does my best death look like?
What does your best death look like?
But my family didn't know to do that.
And my sister was right.
I shouldn't murder Dad with heroin, but I've got to get him out of that body.
So I went to a psychic.
And then a priest, and then a support group, and they all said the same thing: sometimes people hang on when they're worried about loved ones.
Just tell them you're safe, and it's OK to go when you're ready.
So I went to see Dad.
I found him hunched over on the ground in the onesie.
He was staring past me and just kind of looking at the ground. I gave him a ginger ale and just started talking about nothing in particular, but as I was talking, he sneezed from the ginger ale.
And the sneeze -- it jerked his body upright, sparking him back to life a little bit.
And he just kept drinking and sneezing and sparking, over and over and over again until it stopped.
And I heard, "Heheheheheh, heheheheheh . . . this is so fabulous. This is so fabulous.
" His eyes were open and he was looking at me, and I said, "Hi, Dad!
" and he said, "Hiya, Beth.
" And I opened my mouth to tell him, right?
"Dad, if you want to die, you can die.
We're all OK.
" But as I opened my mouth to tell him, all I could say was, "Dad!
I miss you.
" And then he said, "Well, I miss you, too.
" And then I just fell over because I'm just a mess.
So I fell over and I sat there with him because for the first time in a long time he seemed kind of OK.
And I memorized his hands, feeling so grateful that his spirit was still attached to his body.
And in that moment I realized I'm not responsible for this person. I'm not his doctor, I'm not his mother, I'm certainly not his God, and maybe the best way to help him and me is to resume our roles as father and daughter.
And so we just sat there, calm and quiet like we've always done.
Nobody was productive. Both of us are still strong.
"OK, Dad. I'm going to go, but I'll see you tomorrow.
" "OK," he said.
"Hey, this is a pretty nice hacienda.
" Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm transgender.
Let me take a guess at some of thoughts that might be running through your head right now.
"Transgender?
Wait, does that mean that they're actually a man or actually a woman?
" "I wonder if he's had the surgery yet . . . Oh, now I'm looking at his crotch.
Look to the right, that's a safe place to look.
" "Yes, I knew it!
No real man has hips like those.
" "My friend's daughter is transgender -- I wonder if they know each other.
" "Oh my gosh, he is so brave. I would totally support his right to use the men's bathroom.
Wait, but how does he use the bathroom?
How does he have sex?
" OK, OK, let's stop those hypothetical questions before we get too close for my comfort.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I did come here today to share my personal experiences being transgender, but I did not wake up this morning wanting to tell an entire audience about my sex life.
Of course, that's the problem with being trans, right?
People are pretty much always wondering how we have sex and what kind of equipment we're working with below the belt.
Being trans is awkward.
And not just because the gender I was assigned at birth mismatches the one I really am.
Being trans is awkward because everyone else gets awkward when they're around me.
People who support me and all other trans people wholeheartedly are often so scared to say to wrong thing, so embarrassed to not know what they think they should, that they never ask.
Part of what was so nerve-racking about coming out as transgender was knowing that people wouldn't know what I meant.
And when someone comes out as gay, people know what that means, but when you come out as trans, you have to face the misconceptions that will color other people's impressions of you even after you've educated them . . . And you will have to educate them.
When I came out, I wrote at 10-page encyclopedic document with a zip-file attachment of music and videos that I sent to every single person I came out to.
(Laughter) And I kept it in my email signature for months afterwards, because you also don't ever stop coming out.
I came out to the accountant helping me with my taxes and the TSA agents who didn't know which one of them should pat me down, the man or the woman.
I mean, I just came out to everyone watching this.
When I came out to my dad, to my great relief, he was totally cool with me being trans, but as soon as I started talking about physically transitioning, he freaked.
And I quickly realized it was because he, like so many other people, think that physical transition means just one thing: the surgery.
Now, listen, if there were one magical surgery that could turn me into a tall, muscular, societally perfect image of a man overnight, I'd sign up in a heartbeat.
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple.
There are dozens of different gender-affirming surgeries from chest surgeries to bottom surgeries to facial feminization and man-sculpting.
Many trans people will only ever undergo one procedure in their lifetime, if that.
Hormones are why I have a deeper voice and some sparse whiskers on my neck and a giant pimple on my chin.
Basically, they put you through a second puberty . . . it's a blast.
(Laughter) Now, because our transitions are slower and steadier than historic misconceptions can lead people to believe, there can be some confusion about when to call someone by their new name and pronouns.
There's no distinct point in physical transition at which a trans person becomes their true gender.
As soon as they tell you their new name and pronouns, that's when you start using them.
It can be difficult to make the change.
You might slip up here and there; I've slipped up myself with other trans people.
Now, there is no topic that makes other people more awkward about trans people than public bathrooms.
Ah, the bathrooms -- the latest political flash point for LGBT opponents.
Here's a fun fact about bathrooms: more US congressmen have been convicted of assaulting someone in a public bathroom than trans people have been.
(Laughter) The truth is we trans people are so much more scared of you than you are of us.
It's a huge point of discussion in trans communities about which bathroom to start using and when, so we don't attract attention that could lead to violence against us.
I personally started using the men's room when I started getting confused and frightened looks in the women's room, even though I was petrified to start going into the men's room.
And often we opt to just not go to the bathroom at all.
A 2015 national survey of trans people found that eight percent of us had had a urinary tract infection in the past year as a result of avoiding restrooms.
These bathroom bills aren't protecting anyone.
All they're doing is ensuring that when trans people are assaulted in bathrooms, the law will no longer be on our side when we report it.
Being trans means a daily onslaught of these misconceptions.
And I have it pretty easy.
I am a white, able-bodied guy sitting nearly at the peak of privilege mountain.
For non-binary people, for trans women, for trans people of color, it is so much harder. So I've given you a starter pack of trans knowledge that I hope will lead to more learning on your own.
Talk to trans people. Listen to us.
Amplify our voices.
Take the heat off of us and educate those around you so we don't have to every time.
Maybe someday, when I say, "Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm transgender," the only response I'll get is, "Hi, nice to meet you.
" Thank you.
(Applause)
When I heard those bars slam hard, I knew it was for real.
I feel confused.
I feel betrayed.
I feel overwhelmed. I feel silenced.
What just happened?
How could they send me here?
I don't belong here.
How could they make such a huge mistake without any repercussions whatsoever to their actions?
My first night at Langata Women Maximum Security Prison was the toughest.
In January of 2009, I was informed that I had handled a fraudulent transaction unknowingly at the bank where I worked.
I was shocked, scared and terrified.
I would lose a career that I loved passionately.
But that was not the worst.
It got even worse than I could have ever imagined.
I got arrested, maliciously charged and prosecuted.
The absurdity of it all was the arresting officer asking me to pay him 10,000 US dollars and the case would disappear.
I refused.
Two and a half years on, in and out of courts, fighting to prove my innocence.
It was all over the media, in the newspapers, TV, radio.
They came to me again.
This time around, said to me, "If you give us 50,000 US dollars, the judgement will be in your favor," irrespective of the fact that there was no evidence whatsoever that I had any wrongdoing on the charges that I was up against.
I remember the events of my conviction six years ago as if it were yesterday.
The cold, hard face of the judge as she pronounced my sentence on a cold Thursday morning for a crime that I hadn't committed.
I remember holding my three-month-old beautiful daughter whom I had just named Oma, which in my dialect means "truth and justice," as that was what I had longed so much for all this time.
I dressed her in her favorite purple dress, and here she was, about to accompany me to serve this one-year sentence behind bars.
The guards did not seem sensitive to the trauma that this experience was causing me.
The women told me, "You'll adjust to this place.
You'll fit right in.
" I was no longer referred to as Teresa Njoroge.
The number 415/11 was my new identity, and I soon learned that was the case with the other women who we were sharing this space with.
And adjust I did to life on the inside: the prison food, the prison language, the prison life.
Prison is certainly no fairytale world.
And so we moved on.
As I listened to story after story of these close to 700 women during that one year in prison, I soon realized that crime was not what had brought these women to prison, most of them, far from it.
It had started with the education system, whose supply and quality is not equal for all; lack of economic opportunities that pushes these women to petty survival crimes; the health system, social justice system, the criminal justice system.
If any of these women, who were mostly from poor backgrounds, fall through the cracks in the already broken system, the bottom of that chasm is a prison, period.
After my release, I set up Clean Start.
Clean Start is a social enterprise that seeks to give these women and girls a second chance.
What we do is we build bridges for them.
I never thought that one day I would be giving stories of the injustices that are so common within the criminal justice system, but here I am.
"I come as one, but I stand as 10,000." (Applause) For my story is singular, but imagine with me the millions of people in prisons today, yearning for freedom.
Three years post my conviction and two years post my release, I got cleared by the courts of appeal of any wrongdoing.
(Applause) Around the same time, I got blessed with my son, whom I named Uhuru, which in my dialect means "freedom.
" (Applause) Because I had finally gotten the freedom that I so longed for.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Are you as good at things as you think you are?
How good are you at managing money?
What about reading people's emotions?
How healthy are you compared to other people you know?
Are you better than average at grammar?
Knowing how competent we are and how are skill stack up against other people's is more than a self-esteem boost.
It helps us figure out when we can forge ahead on our own decisions and instincts and when we need, instead, to seek out advice.
But psychological research suggests that we're not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately. In fact, we frequently overestimate our own abilities.
Researchers have a name for this phenomena, the Dunning-Kruger effect.
This effect explains why more than 100 studies have shown that people display illusory superiority.
We judge ourselves as better than others to a degree that violates the laws of math.
When software engineers at two companies were asked to rate their performance, 32% of the engineers at one company and 42% at the other put themselves in the top 5%.
In another study, 88% of American drivers described themselves as having above average driving skills.
These aren't isolated findings.
On average, people tend to rate themselves better than most in disciplines ranging from health, leadership skills, ethics, and beyond.
What's particularly interesting is that those with the least ability are often the most likely to overrate their skills to the greatest extent.
People measurably poor at logical reasoning, grammar, financial knowledge, math, emotional intelligence, running medical lab tests, and chess all tend to rate their expertise almost as favorably as actual experts do.
So who's most vulnerable to this delusion?
Sadly, all of us because we all have pockets of incompetence we don't recognize.
But why?
When psychologists Dunning and Kruger first described the effect in 1999, they argued that people lacking knowledge and skill in particular areas suffer a double curse.
First, they make mistakes and reach poor decisions.
But second, those same knowledge gaps also prevent them from catching their errors.
WIthout a strong grasp of the rules of debate, the students simply couldn't recognize when or how often their arguments broke down.
The Dunning-Kruger effect isn't a question of ego blinding us to our weaknesses.
People usually do admit their deficits once they can spot them. In one study, students who had initially done badly on a logic quiz and then took a mini course on logic were quite willing to label their original performances as awful.
That may be why people with a moderate amount of experience or expertise often have less confidence in their abilities.
They know enough to know that there's a lot they don't know. Meanwhile, experts tend to be aware of just how knowledgeable they are. But they often make a different mistake: they assume that everyone else is knowledgeable, too.
The result is that people, whether they're inept or highly skilled, are often caught in a bubble of inaccurate self-perception.
When they're unskilled, they can't see their own faults. When they're exceptionally competent, they don't perceive how unusual their abilities are.
So if the Dunning-Kruger effect is invisible to those experiencing it, what can you do to find out how good you actually are at various things?
First, ask for feedback from other people, and consider it, even if it's hard to hear.
Second, and more important, keep learning.
The more knowledgeable we become, the less likely we are to have invisible holes in our competence.
Perhaps it all boils down to that old proverb: When arguing with a fool, first make sure the other person isn't doing the same thing.
"All I wanted was a much-deserved promotion, and he told me to 'Get up on the desk and spread 'em.
'" "All the men in my office wrote down on a piece of paper the sexual favors that I could do for them.
All I had asked for was an office with a window.
" "I asked for his advice about how I could get a bill out of committee; he asked me if I brought my kneepads.
" Those are just a few of the horrific stories that I heard from women over the last year, as I've been investigating workplace sexual harassment.
And what I found out is that it's an epidemic across the world.
It's a horrifying reality for millions of women, when all they want to do every day is go to work.
Sexual harassment doesn't discriminate. You can wear a skirt, hospital scrubs, army fatigues.
You can be young or old, married or single, black or white.
You can be a Republican, a Democrat or an Independent.
I heard from so many women: police officers, members of our military, financial assistants, actors, engineers, lawyers, bankers, accountants, teachers . . . journalists. Sexual harassment, it turns out, is not about sex.
It's about power, and about what somebody does to you to try and take away your power.
And I'm here today to encourage you to know that you can take that power back.
(Applause) On July 6, 2016, I jumped off a cliff all by myself.
But then, something miraculous started to happen.
Thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame.
They told me that I became their voice -- they were voiceless.
And suddenly, I realized that even in the 21st century, every woman still has a story. Like Joyce, a flight attendant supervisor whose boss, in meetings every day, would tell her about the porn that he'd watched the night before while drawing penises on his notepad.
She went to complain.
She was called "crazy" and fired.
Like Joanne, Wall Street banker.
Her male colleagues would call her that vile c-word every day.
She complained -- labeled a troublemaker, never to do another Wall Street deal again.
Like Elizabeth, an army officer. Her male subordinates would wave one-dollar bills in her face, and say, "Dance for me!
" And when she went to complain to a major, he said, "What?
Only one dollar?
You're worth at least five or ten!
" After reading, replying to all and crying over all of these emails, I realized I had so much work to do.
Here are the startling facts: one in three women -- that we know of -- have been sexually harassed in the workplace.
Seventy-one percent of those incidences never get reported.
Why?
Because when women come forward, they're still called liars and troublemakers and demeaned and trashed and demoted and blacklisted and fired.
Reporting sexual harassment can be, in many cases, career-ending.
Of all the women that reached out to me, almost none are still today working in their chosen profession, and that is outrageous.
I, too, was silent in the beginning.
It happened to me at the end of my year as Miss America, when I was meeting with a very high-ranking TV executive in New York City.
I thought he was helping me throughout the day, making a lot of phone calls.
We went to dinner, and in the back seat of a car, he suddenly lunged on top of me and stuck his tongue down my throat.
I didn't realize that to "get into the business" -- silly me -- he also intended to get into my pants.
And just a week later, when I was in Los Angeles meeting with a high-ranking publicist, it happened again.
Again, in a car.
And he took my neck in his hand, and he shoved my head so hard into his crotch, I couldn't breathe.
These are the events that suck the life out of all of your self-confidence.
These are the events that, until recently, I didn't even call assault.
And this is why we have so much work to do.
After my year as Miss America, I continued to meet a lot of well-known people, including Donald Trump.
When this picture was taken in 1988, nobody could have ever predicted where we'd be today.
(Laughter) Me, fighting to end sexual harassment in the workplace; he, president of the United States in spite of it.
And shortly thereafter, I got my first gig in television news in Richmond, Virginia. Check out that confident smile with the bright pink jacket. Not so much the hair.
(Laughter) I was working so hard to prove that blondes have a lot of brains.
But ironically, one of the first stories I covered was the Anita Hill hearings in Washington, DC.
And shortly thereafter, I, too, was sexually harassed in the workplace.
I was covering a story in rural Virginia, and when we got back into the car, my cameraman started saying to me, wondering how much I had enjoyed when he touched my breasts when he put the microphone on me.
And it went downhill from there.
I was bracing myself against the passenger door -- this was before cellphones.
I was petrified.
I actually envisioned myself rolling outside of that door as the car was going 50 miles per hour like I'd seen in the movies, and wondering how much it would hurt.
When the story about Harvey Weinstein came to light -- one the most well-known movie moguls in all of Hollywood -- the allegations were horrific.
But so many women came forward, and it made me realize what I had done meant something.
(Applause) He had such a lame excuse. He said he was a product of the '60s and '70s, and that that was the culture then.
Yeah, that was the culture then, and unfortunately, it still is.
Why?
Because of all the myths that are still associated with sexual harassment.
"Women should just take another job and find another career.
" Yeah, right.
Tell that to the single mom working two jobs, trying to make ends meet, who's also being sexually harassed.
"Women -- they bring it on themselves.
" By the clothes that we wear and the makeup that we put on.
I would know.
"Women bring these claims because they want to be famous and rich.
" Our own president said that.
I bet Taylor Swift, one of the most well-known and richest singers in the world, didn't need more money or fame when she came forward with her groping case for one dollar.
And I'm so glad she did.
Breaking news: the untold story about women and sexual harassment in the workplace: women just want a safe, welcoming and harass-free environment.
That's it.
(Applause) So how do we go about getting our power back?
I have three solutions.
Number one: we need to turn bystanders and enablers into allies.
Ninety-eight percent of United States corporations right now have sexual harassment training policies.
Seventy percent have prevention programs.
But still, overwhelmingly, bystanders and witnesses don't come forward.
In 2016, the Harvard Business Review called it the "bystander effect.
" And yet -- remember 9/11. Millions of times we've heard, "If you see something, say something.
" Imagine how impactful that would be if we carried that through to bystanders in the workplace regarding sexual harassment -- to recognize and interrupt these incidences; to confront the perpetrators to their face; to help and protect the victims.
This is my shout-out to men: we need you in this fight.
And to women, too -- enablers to allies.
Number two: change the laws.
How many of you out there know whether or not you have a forced arbitration clause in your employment contract?
Not a lot of hands.
And if you don't know, you should, and here's why.
TIME Magazine calls it, right there on the screen, "The teeny tiny little print in contracts that keeps sexual harassment claims unheard.
" Here's what it is.
Forced arbitration takes away your Seventh Amendment right to an open jury process.
It's secret.
You don't get the same witnesses or depositions.
In many cases, the company picks the arbitrator for you.
There are no appeals, and only 20 percent of the time does the employee win.
But again, it's secret, so nobody ever knows what happened to you.
This is why I've been working so diligently on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC to change the laws.
And here's what I tell the Senators: sexual harassment is apolitical.
Before somebody harasses you, they don't ask you if you're a Republican or Democrat first.
They just do it.
And this is why we should all care.
Number three: be fierce.
I know it's scary, but let's do it for our kids.
Let's stop this for the next generations.
I know that I did it for my children.
They were paramount in my decision-making about whether or not I would come forward.
My beautiful children, my 12-year-old son, Christian, my 14-year-old daughter, Kaia.
And boy, did I underestimate them.
The first day of school last year happened to be the day my resolution was announced, and I was so anxious about what they would face.
My daughter came home from school and she said, "Mommy, so many people asked me what happened to you over the summer.
" Then she looked at me in the eyes and she said, "And mommy, I was so proud to say that you were my mom.
" And two weeks later, when she finally found the courage to stand up to two kids who had been making her life miserable, she came home to me and she said, "Mommy, I found the courage to do it because I saw you do it.
" (Applause) You see, giving the gift of courage is contagious.
And I hope that my journey has inspired you, because right now, it's the tipping point.
We are watching history happen.
More and more women are coming forward and saying, "Enough is enough.
" (Applause) Here's my one last plea to companies.
Let's hire back all those women whose careers were lost because of some random jerk.
Because here's what I know about women: we will not longer be underestimated, intimidated or set back; we will not be silenced by the ways of the establishment or the relics of the past. No. We will stand up and speak up and have our voices heard.
We will be the women we were meant to be.
And above all, we will always be fierce.
Thank you.
(Applause)
To avoid dangerous climate change, we're going to need to cut emissions rapidly.
That should be a pretty uncontentious statement, certainly with this audience.
But here's something that's slightly more contentious: it's not going to be enough.
We will munch our way through our remaining carbon budget for one and a half degrees in a few short years, and the two degree budget in about two decades.
We need to not only cut emissions extremely rapidly, we also need to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
Thank you.
(Laughter) I work assessing a whole range of these proposed techniques to see if they can work.
We could use plants to take CO2 out, and then store it in trees, in the soil, deep underground or in the oceans.
We could build large machines, so-called artificial trees, that will scrub CO2 from the air.
For these ideas to be feasible, we need to understand whether they can be applied at a vast scale in a way that is safe, economic and socially acceptable.
All of these ideas come with tradeoffs.
None of them are perfect, but many have potential.
It's unlikely that any one of them will solve it on its own.
There is no silver bullet, but potentially together, they may form the silver buckshot that we need to stop climate change in its tracks.
I'm working independently on one particular idea which uses natural gas to generate electricity in a way that takes carbon dioxide out of the air.
Huh?
How does that work?
So the Origen Power Process feeds natural gas into a fuel cell.
About half the chemical energy is converted into electricity, and the remainder into heat, which is used to break down limestone into lime and carbon dioxide.
Now at this point, you're probably thinking that I'm nuts.
It's actually generating carbon dioxide.
But the key point is, all of the carbon dioxide generated, both from the fuel cell and from the lime kiln, is pure, and that's really important, because it means you can either use that carbon dioxide or you can store it away deep underground at low cost.
And then the lime that you produce can be used in industrial processes, and in being used, it scrubs CO2 out of the air. Overall, the process is carbon negative.
It removes carbon dioxide from the air.
If you normally generate electricity from natural gas, you emit about 400 grams of CO2 into the air for every kilowatt-hour.
With this process, that figure is minus 600. At the moment, power generation is responsible for about a quarter of all carbon dioxide emissions.
Hypothetically, if you replaced all power generation with this process, then you would not only eliminate all of the emissions from power generation but you would start removing emissions from other sectors as well, potentially cutting 60 percent of overall carbon emissions.
You could even use the lime to add it directly to seawater to counteract ocean acidification, one of the other issues that is caused by CO2 in the atmosphere.
In fact, you get more bang for your buck.
You absorb about twice as much carbon dioxide when you add it to seawater as when you use it industrially.
But this is where it gets really complicated.
While counteracting ocean acidification is a good thing, we don't fully understand what the environmental consequences are, and so we need to assess whether this treatment is actually better than the disease that it is seeking to cure.
We need to put in place step-by-step governance for experiments to assess this safely.
And the scale: to avoid dangerous climate change, we are going to need to remove trillions -- and yes, that's trillions with a T -- trillions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the decades ahead.
It will cost a few percent of GDP -- think defense-sized expenditure, lots of industrial activity and inevitably harmful side effects.
But if the scale seems enormous, it is only because of the scale of the problem that we are seeking to solve.
It's enormous as well.
We can no longer avoid these thorny issues.
We face risks whichever way we turn: a world changed by climate change or a world changed by climate change and our efforts to counter climate change.
Would that it were not so, but we can no longer afford to close our eyes, block our ears, and say la-la-la.
We need to grow up and face the consequences of our actions.
(Applause) Does talk of curing climate change undermine the will to cut emissions?
This is a real concern, so we need to emphasize the paramount importance of reducing emissions and how speculative these ideas are.
But having done so, we still need to examine them.
Can we cure climate change?
I don't know, but we certainly can't if we don't try.
We need ambition without arrogance.
We need the ambition to restore the atmosphere, to draw down carbon dioxide back to a level that is compatible with a stable climate and healthy oceans.
This will be an enormous undertaking.
You could describe it as a cathedral project.
Those involved at the outset may draft the plans and dig the foundations, but they will not raise the spire to its full height. That task, that privilege, belongs to our descendants.
None of us will see that day, but we must start in the hope that future generations will be able to finish the job.
So, do you want to change the world?
I don't.
I do not seek the change the world, but rather keep it as it's meant to be.
Thank you.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Thanks.
I just want to ask you a couple of other questions.
Tell us a bit more about this idea of putting lime in the ocean.
I mean, on the face of it, it's pretty compelling -- anti-ocean acidification -- and it absorbs more CO2. You talked about, we need to do an experiment on this.
What would a responsible experiment look like?
Tim Kruger: So I think you need to do a series of experiments, but you need to do them just very small stage-by-stage.
In the same way, when you're trialing a new drug, you wouldn't just go into human trials straight off.
You would do a small experiment.
And so the first things to do are experiments entirely on land, in special containers, away from the environment.
And then once you are confident that that can be done safely, you move to the next stage.
If you're not confident, you don't.
But step by step.
CA: And who would fund such experiments?
Because they kind of impact the whole planet at some level.
Is that why nothing is happening on this?
TK: So I think you can do small-scale experiments in national waters, and then it's probably the requirement of national funders to do that.
But ultimately, if you wanted to counter ocean acidification in this way on a global scale, you would need to do it in international waters, and then you would need to have an international community working on it.
CA: Even in national waters, you know, the ocean's all connected.
That lime is going to get out there.
And people feel outraged about doing experiments on the planet, as we've heard.
How do you counter that?
TK: I think you touch on something which is really important.
It's about a social license to operate.
And I think it may be that it is impossible to do, but we need to have the courage to try, to move this forward, to see what we can do, and to engage openly.
And we need to engage with people in a transparent way. We need to ask them beforehand.
And I think if we ask them, we have to be open to the possibility that the answer will come back, "No, don't do it.
" CA: Thanks so much. That was really fascinating.
TK: Thank you.
(Applause)To avoid dangerous climate change, we're going to need to cut emissions rapidly.
That should be a pretty uncontentious statement, certainly with this audience.
But here's something that's slightly more contentious: it's not going to be enough.
We will munch our way through our remaining carbon budget for one and a half degrees in a few short years, and the two degree budget in about two decades.
We need to not only cut emissions extremely rapidly, we also need to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
Thank you.
(Laughter) I work assessing a whole range of these proposed techniques to see if they can work.
We could use plants to take CO2 out, and then store it in trees, in the soil, deep underground or in the oceans.
We could build large machines, so-called artificial trees, that will scrub CO2 from the air.
For these ideas to be feasible, we need to understand whether they can be applied at a vast scale in a way that is safe, economic and socially acceptable.
All of these ideas come with tradeoffs.
None of them are perfect, but many have potential.
It's unlikely that any one of them will solve it on its own.
There is no silver bullet, but potentially together, they may form the silver buckshot that we need to stop climate change in its tracks.
I'm working independently on one particular idea which uses natural gas to generate electricity in a way that takes carbon dioxide out of the air.
Huh?
How does that work?
So the Origen Power Process feeds natural gas into a fuel cell.
About half the chemical energy is converted into electricity, and the remainder into heat, which is used to break down limestone into lime and carbon dioxide.
Now at this point, you're probably thinking that I'm nuts.
It's actually generating carbon dioxide.
But the key point is, all of the carbon dioxide generated, both from the fuel cell and from the lime kiln, is pure, and that's really important, because it means you can either use that carbon dioxide or you can store it away deep underground at low cost.
And then the lime that you produce can be used in industrial processes, and in being used, it scrubs CO2 out of the air. Overall, the process is carbon negative.

TK: Thank you.
I'm going to begin today with a story and end with a revolution.
(Laughter) Are you ready?
Audience: Yes!
Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story.
All my life I wanted to be an actress.
From the time I was very small, I could feel the magic of storytelling and I wanted to be a part of it.
So, at the ripe age of 21, I graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and ready to take my rightful place as the next Meryl Streep.
That's my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.
(Laughter) Now, it's important for this story that you understand that I was raised by a raging feminist.
I'm not going to say that you can't sing that song, but if you are going to sing that song, I do need you to understand the extremely problematic gender construct that it reinforces. " (Laughter) So that's where I come from.
So it just honestly never even occurred to me that I would be prevented from doing anything in my life because I'm a woman. OK. So I graduate.
And I start auditioning and I get work, slowly.
But I just start noticing that the parts available for women are terrible.
But, remember -- I came here to play smart, willful, complicated, interesting complex, confident female characters, right?
Like Meryl.
And all of the sudden, I am wrestling with 300 other gorgeous, talented women to play . . . "[Female] No dialogue.
The character only needs to stand on a balcony, look forlorn, and walk back inside the house.
Only partial nudity.
" (Laughter) "[Sarah] Brian's love interest.
Attractive, cute, and flirty, she is the ideal girl and Brian's prize throughout the entire film.
" "[Mom] A proper Southern belle who is making peace with the fact that her only purpose in life is to tend to her husband.
" "[Abby] Must be OK with a tastefully shot gang rape, along with performing 19th-century dance.
" (Laughter) Those are actual casting notices.
And so I just mentioned this to my agent one day, I say, "I feel like I'm not really going in for parts that I'm actually excited about playing.
And he said, "Yeah. I don't really know what to do with you.
And we decide, you know what?
No problem.
And I'll write and then I'll write it about two complex female characters.
So we do.
So, you do understand that at some point you are going to have to hire a male producer onboard, right?
What do we do about this?
And I think this is how sexism continues on in 2016, right?
" The problem is that unless we do something about it, that is the way the world will always be.
I mean, we're facing some rather significant problems in the world just at present, what does it really matter if I can't get a job, or you're stuck watching "Transformer 17," right?
(Laughter) In fact, studies show that the movies you watch don't just affect your hobbies, they affect your career choices, your emotions, your sense of identity, your relationships, your mental health -- even your marital status.
(Laughter) So, now before I get to my four-point plan for the revolution -- yes, I have a four-point plan -- I have two pieces of very good and important news for you.
(Applause) We exist!
So here we have our 50 women.
" So what you're left with is a giant underserved audience and untapped profit potential. So we exist, and we have stories to tell.
We have so many stories to tell.
And despite everything we've heard: you want to see them.
The problem is, we've got this thing -- let's call it "Hollywood" -- (Laughter) no, no, I'm just kidding; I've met some very nice people in Hollywood -- Hollywood, preventing us from getting to you.
So here is my four-point plan for the revolution, and everybody -- man or woman, in this room or anywhere in the world -- is going to get to help.
And this revolution is not just for women.
Anyone who has been disenfranchised, anyone whose story has not been told, the same principles apply, and I really hope we can do the revolution together.
My four-point plan.
Number one: watch movies.
Isn't this a good revolution?
(Laughter) OK, first I want to talk to anyone who watches movies. Who watches movies in here?
Great!
Will you pledge to watch one film by a female filmmaker per month?
That's it, just start there.
Great!
If you need help finding them, you can go to the website, moviesbyher.
com It's an easily searchable database of films by women.
And as you start watching all movies, I just want you to pay attention to the female characters.
How many of them are there?
What are they wearing?
Or not?
Do they get to do cool things, or are they just there to emotionally support the men?
I'm telling you, once you see this, you're not going to be able to unsee it.
And as you start noticing this, it's going to shift your viewing habits.
And this already sizable market is going to continue to grow.
Step two: make movies.
So now I'm talking to all the female filmmakers out there: we need you to be very brave.
It will be harder for you to make movies.
In fact, there will be an entire industry constantly telling you that your stories don't matter.
And we need you to make them, anyway.
That 18 percent in the micro-budget range -- that is on us to fix.
Don't wait for permission.
Don't wait for somebody to pick you, because 95 percent says they are not going to.
Crowd fund.
Write letters to eccentric relatives.
I know how hard it is, but you have to make your movies -- now, today, features, not shorts.
There is an audience for them, and they want and need to see them.
Three: invest in each other.
Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like we need to stop wasting so much energy on a system that does not want us.
We need to find our audience and invest in cultivating them.
If we can figure out how to make our movies and deliver them to the audiences that want them, that's it.
That's the whole game.
And whatever they're doing in the middle is going to cease to be quite so important.
Audiences, invest in us.
Help us make the movies that you want to see.
If you can give a female filmmaker 25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign, great, do that.
If you can invest more seriously and help us over that critical million-dollar hurdle, do that.
But invest in seeing the other half of the story. Four: disrupt through business.
So now I'm talking to all of the businesspeople and entrepreneurs.
This does not happen very often in the world, but right here we have a golden situation in which you can enact significant social change while also making money.
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption. The old models of financing and distribution are crumbling -- please come in and disrupt it.
I'll give you an example.
Right now, with some incredible women, I am launching the "The 51 Fund.
" It's a venture capital fund that will finance films written, directed and produced by women in that critical $1-5 million range.
We will give a significant number of female filmmakers the chance to make their movies and we will deliver them to the audiences who want them.
Good for equality, good for business.
But that's only one example, we need more.
There is room for so many more.
So I say to you: Hollywood is leaving money on the table.
Come pick it up.
(Applause) Now, all of this may seem like a lot, but it is actually so doable.
Entrenched systems don't change because you ask the people in charge, they change because all of the people who don't have what they want rise up and make that change happen.
And don't you want to?
I want to see what the other 51 percent of the population has to say.
I want to watch movies that teach me about people who are different than I am.
I want to see women's bodies on film that aren't perfect. I want to give our little boys the chance to empathize with female characters so that they can become more whole men.
And I definitely want to give a little girl who may not have a real-life role model the chance to watch movies and see women doing everything she dreams of achieving. This is not about making one industry better.
This is about making a better world.
Will you help?
The time for waiting is over.
The time for the revolution is now.
(Cheers and applause)I'm going to begin today with a story and end with a revolution.
(Laughter) Are you ready?
Audience: Yes!
Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story.
All my life I wanted to be an actress.
From the time I was very small, I could feel the magic of storytelling and I wanted to be a part of it.
So, at the ripe age of 21, I graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and ready to take my rightful place as the next Meryl Streep.

" (Laughter) "[Sarah] Brian's love interest.
Attractive, cute, and flirty, she is the ideal girl and Brian's prize throughout the entire film.
" "[Mom] A proper Southern belle who is making peace with the fact that her only purpose in life is to tend to her husband.
" "[Abby] Must be OK with a tastefully shot gang rape, along with performing 19th-century dance.
" (Laughter) Those are actual casting notices.
And so I just mentioned this to my agent one day, I say, "I feel like I'm not really going in for parts that I'm actually excited about playing.
And he said, "Yeah. I don't really know what to do with you.
You're too smart for the parts that are being written for women in their 20s, and you're not quite pretty enough to be the hot one, so I think you'll work when you're 35." (Laughter) And I said, "Oh.
That's funny.
I always thought that when you were 35, you were kind of, like, over the hill as an actress, that you were relegated to playing 20-year-olds' mothers.
" And he said, "Yeah -- (Laughter) It's just the way it is.
" So, maybe a year or so after this, I'm having lunch with an actress friend of mine, and we're talking about how insane this is.
And we decide, you know what?
No problem.
And I'll write and then I'll write it about two complex female characters.
So we do.
We set out to make this movie, and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring an all-female production team: the writer, directors, producers, and it's a film about two women.
And so pretty soon, we're sitting in the office of a successful male producer, and he goes, "OK, girls.
So, you do understand that at some point you are going to have to hire a male producer onboard, right?
Just so that people will trust you with their money.
" Over and over again, people tell us, "Yeah, but people don't really want to see films about women, so maybe you should think about making something else.
It's just the way it is.
" So we make the movie, anyway.
We scrape together 80,000 dollars, and we make it, and it does so well.
It gets into tons of festivals and we win a lot of awards and it's big and exciting.
But these experiences I've had just keep rubbing at me.
And so, I just start talking about them, first, at Q and A's after screenings of the film, and then I get invited to be on panels and talk at conferences.
And the really amazing thing is that, to begin with, when I'm just talking to audiences and other people, you know, coming up in the film industry, the universal reaction is, "Oh my god!
This is terrible.
What do we do about this?
" But the bigger panels I get on, suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me, "Look, I totally agree with everything you're saying.
You just need to be really careful about where you say it. " An Oscar-winning producer tells me that she doesn't think it's a good idea to play the woman card.
It's just the way it is.
And I think this is how sexism continues on in 2016, right?
For the most part, it happens casually -- unconsciously, even.
It happens because people are just trying to get along within an existing system.
It happens, maybe, out of a genuine desire to teach a young woman the way that the world "just is.
" The problem is that unless we do something about it, that is the way the world will always be.
So why should you care about this?
Right?
I mean, we're facing some rather significant problems in the world just at present, what does it really matter if I can't get a job, or you're stuck watching "Transformer 17," right?
(Laughter) Well, let me put it to you this way: the year "Jaws" came out, Americans suddenly started listing "sharks" among their top 10 major fears.
In 1995, BMW paid the James Bond franchise three million dollars to have James Bond switch from driving an Aston Martin to a BMW Z3. That one move caused so many people to go out and buy that car, that BMW made 240 million dollars in pre-sales alone.
The year that "Brave" and "Hunger Games" came out, female participation in archery went up 105 percent.
(Laughter) In fact, studies show that the movies you watch don't just affect your hobbies, they affect your career choices, your emotions, your sense of identity, your relationships, your mental health -- even your marital status.
So now, consider this: if you have watched mostly American movies in your lifetime, 95 percent of all the films you have ever seen were directed by men.
Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of all of the leading characters that you have ever seen were men.
And even if we just talk about the last five years, 55 percent of the time that you have seen a woman in a movie, she was naked or scantily clad.
That affects you.
That affects all of us.
We actually can't even imagine how much it affects us, because this is all we've ever had.
Stories -- and movies are just modern stories -- are not frivolous.
They're actually the mechanism through which we process our experience of being alive.
They're the way that we understand the world and our place in it.
They're the way we develop empathy for people who have experiences different than our own.
And right now, all of that is being funneled at us through the prism of this one perspective.
It's not that it's a bad perspective, but don't we deserve to hear them all?
How would the world be different if all of the stories were told?
So what do we do about this?
I mean, we have really yelled at them.
And yet, Paramount and Fox recently released their slates, and of the 47 films that they will release between now and 2018, not a single one will be directed by a woman.
So it is beginning to occur to me that waiting for Hollywood to grow a conscience may not actually be a winning strategy.
In fact, it seems to me that whenever there is a small, ruling class of people who have all of the money and power and resources, they're not actually that excited about giving it up.
And so you don't get change by asking them or even yelling at them.
You have to make that change happen through a revolution.
Now, please don't worry -- I promise you, here, now, today, our body count will be very low.
(Laughter) So, now before I get to my four-point plan for the revolution -- yes, I have a four-point plan -- I have two pieces of very good and important news for you.
Good news number one: there are female filmmakers.
(Cheers and applause) Yes!
I know!
(Applause) We exist!
We actually graduate from film schools at the same rate that men do -- 50 percent.
So here we have our 50 women.
The problem is that as soon as you get to the micro-budget film, so even the very smallest films, we're already only directing 18 percent.
Then you get to slightly bigger films, indies in the $1-5 million budget range, and we go down to 12 percent.
So by the time you get to the studio system, we're only directing five percent of movies.
Now, I know some of you out there will look at this and secretly think to yourselves, "Well, maybe women just aren't as good at directing movies.
" And that's not a totally insane question.
I mean, we like to believe the film industry is a meritocracy, right?
(Laughs) (Laughter) But look at this trajectory.
Either you have to accept that women are actually five percent as talented as men, which I don't, or you have to accept that there are serious systemic issues preventing us from getting from here to there.
But the good news is, we exist, and there is a vast amount of untapped potential over here.
Good news number two, and this is really good news: films by and about women make more money.
Yes! Yes!
It's true!
(Cheers and applause) It's true. The Washington Post recently released a study showing that films that feature women make 23 cents more on every dollar than films that don't.
And in every single category, the return on investment is higher if it's a woman.
Fact: women buy 51 percent of all movie tickets.
Films by and about women make more money.
And of course, at least some portion of the male population does also like women -- (Laughter) so "women films" are not just for women.
And yet, Hollywood only targets 18 percent of all of their films as "women films.
We have so many stories to tell.
So here is my four-point plan for the revolution, and everybody -- man or woman, in this room or anywhere in the world -- is going to get to help.
And this revolution is not just for women.
Anyone who has been disenfranchised, anyone whose story has not been told, the same principles apply, and I really hope we can do the revolution together.
Number one: watch movies.
Isn't this a good revolution?
(Laughter) OK, first I want to talk to anyone who watches movies. Who watches movies in here?

And whatever they're doing in the middle is going to cease to be quite so important.
Audiences, invest in us.
Help us make the movies that you want to see.
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption. The old models of financing and distribution are crumbling -- please come in and disrupt it.
I'll give you an example.
Good for equality, good for business.
But that's only one example, we need more.
There is room for so many more.
Entrenched systems don't change because you ask the people in charge, they change because all of the people who don't have what they want rise up and make that change happen.
And don't you want to?
I want to watch movies that teach me about people who are different than I am.
And I definitely want to give a little girl who may not have a real-life role model the chance to watch movies and see women doing everything she dreams of achieving. This is not about making one industry better.
Will you help?
The time for waiting is over.
In Ghana's capital, Accra, there are numbers and letters scrawled onto the sides of walls, where they piloted address systems but not finished them.
Here's why the issue of addressing stuck with me.
I worked in the music business for 10 years, and what you may not know about the music world is that every day, people struggle with the problems of addressing.
So for example, right here, I'm standing at mustards. coupons. pinup, (Laughter) but over here . . . I'm standing at pinched.
So far, we've built it into 14 languages, including French, Swahili and Arabic, and we're working on more now, like Xhosa, Zulu and Hindi.
For me, poor addressing was an annoying frustration, but for billions of people, it's a huge business inefficiency, severely hampers their infrastructure growth, and can cost lives.
I kept going back to the same articles, reading them again and again, on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland.
And if so, how deep do they take that water?
I'd like to take you back about seven years in my life.
I was fired, along with several others.
This is called clean technology, and it felt really meaningful to me.
I wanted to connect with them.
(Cheers) (Applause)
I want us to start by thinking about this device, the phone that's very likely in your pockets right now.
Over 40 percent of Americans check their phones within five minutes of waking up every morning.
And then they look at it another 50 times during the day.
Grownups consider this device to be a necessity.
But now I want you to imagine it in the hands of a three-year-old, and as a society, we get anxious.
Parents are very worried that this device is going to stunt their children's social growth; that it's going to keep them from getting up and moving; that somehow, this is going to disrupt childhood.
So, I want to challenge this attitude.
I can envision a future where we would be excited to see a preschooler interacting with a screen.
These screens can get kids up and moving even more.
They have the power to tell us more about what a child is learning than a standardized test can.
And here's the really crazy thought: I believe that these screens have the power to prompt more real-life conversations between kids and their parents.
Now, I was perhaps an unlikely champion for this cause.
I studied children's literature because I was going to work with kids and books.
But about 20 years ago, I had an experience that shifted my focus.
I was helping lead a research study about preschoolers and websites.
And I walked in and was assigned a three-year-old named Maria.
Maria had actually never seen a computer before.
So the first thing I had to do was teach her how to use the mouse, and when I opened up the screen, she moved it across the screen, and she stopped on a character named X the Owl.
And when she did that, the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.
Maria dropped the mouse, pushed back from the table, leaped up and started waving frantically back at him.
Her connection to that character was visceral.
This wasn't a passive screen experience.
This was a human experience.
And it was exactly appropriate for a three-year-old.
I've now worked at PBS Kids for more than 15 years, and my work there is focused on harnessing the power of technology as a positive in children's lives.
I believe that as a society, we're missing a big opportunity.
We're letting our fear and our skepticism about these devices hold us back from realizing their potential in our children's lives.
Fear about kids and technology is nothing new; we've been here before.
Over 50 years ago, the debate was raging about the newly dominant media: the television.
That box in the living room?
It might be separating kids from one another.
It might keep them away from the outside world.
But this is the moment when Fred Rogers, the long-running host of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," challenged society to look at television as a tool, a tool that could promote emotional growth.
Here's what he did: he looked out from the screen, and he held a conversation, as if he were speaking to each child individually about feelings.
And then he would pause and let them think about them.
Today it's not just one box.
Kids are surrounded by devices.
And I'm also a parent -- I understand this feeling of anxiety.
But I want us to look at three common fears that parents have, and see if we can shift our focus to the opportunity that's in each of them. So. Fear number one: "Screens are passive.
This is going to keep our kids from getting up and moving.
" Chris Kratt and Martin Kratt are zoologist brothers who host a show about animals called "Wild Kratts.
" And they approached the PBS team to say, "Can we do something with those cameras that are built into every device now?
Could those cameras capture a very natural kid play pattern -- pretending to be animals?
" So we started with bats.
And when kids came in to play this game, they loved seeing themselves on-screen with wings.
But my favorite part of this, when the game was over and we turned off the screens?
The kids kept being bats.
They kept flying around the room, they kept veering left and right to catch mosquitoes.
And they remembered things.
They remembered that bats fly at night.
And they remembered that when bats sleep, they hang upside down and fold their wings in.
This game definitely got kids up and moving.
But also, now when kids go outside, do they look at a bird and think, "How does a bird fly differently than I flew when I was a bat?
" The digital technology prompted embodied learning that kids can now take out into the world. Fear number two: "Playing games on these screens is just a waste of time.
It's going to distract children from their education.
" Game developers know that you can learn a lot about a player's skill by looking at the back-end data: Where did a player pause?
Where did they make a few mistakes before they found the right answer?
My team wanted to take that tool set and apply it to academic learning.
Our producer in Boston, WGBH, created a series of Curious George games focused on math.
And researchers came in and had 80 preschoolers play these games.
They then gave all 80 of those preschoolers a standardized math test.
We could see early on that these games were actually helping kids understand some key skills.
But our partners at UCLA wanted us to dig deeper.
So they made a neural net -- they essentially trained the computer to use this data, and here are the results.
This is a subset of the children's standardized math scores.
And this is the computer's prediction of each child's score, based on playing some Curious George games.
The prediction is astonishingly accurate, especially considering the fact that these games weren't built for assessment.
The team that did this study believes that games like these can teach us more about a child's cognitive learning than a standardized test can.
What if games could reduce testing time in the classroom?
What if they could reduce testing anxiety?
How could they give teachers snapshots of insight to help them better focus their individualized learning?
So the third fear I want to address is the one that I think is often the biggest.
And that's this: "These screens are isolating me from my child.
" Let's play out a scenario. Let's say that you are a parent, and you need 25 minutes of uninterrupted time to get dinner ready.
And in order to do that, you hand a tablet to your three-year-old.
Now, this is a moment where you probably feel very guilty about what you just did.
But now imagine this: Twenty minutes later, you receive a text message. on that cell phone that's always within arm's reach.
And it says: "Alex just matched five rhyming words.
Ask him to play this game with you.
Can you think of a word that rhymes with 'cat'?
Or how about 'ball'?
" In our studies, when parents receive simple tips like these, they felt empowered.
They were so excited to play these games at the dinner table with their kids.
And the kids loved it, too.
Not only did it feel like magic that their parents knew what they had been playing, kids love to play games with their parents.
Just the act of talking to kids about their media can be incredibly powerful.
Last summer, Texas Tech University published a study that the show "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood" could promote the development of empathy among children. But there was a really important catch to this study: the greatest benefit was only when parents talked to kids about what they watched.
Neither just watching nor just talking about it was enough; it was the combination that was key.
So when I read this study, I started thinking about how rarely parents of preschoolers actually talk to kids about the content of what they're playing and what they're watching.
And so I decided to try it with my four-year-old.
I said, "Were you playing a car game earlier today?
" And Benjamin perked up and said, "Yes!
And did you see that I made my car out of a pickle?
It was really hard to open the trunk.
" (Laughter) This hilarious conversation about what was fun in the game and what could have been better continued all the way to school that morning.
I'm not here to suggest to you that all digital media is great for kids.
There are legitimate reasons for us to be concerned about the current state of children's content on these screens.
And it's right for us to be thinking about balance: Where do screens fit against all the other things that a child needs to do to learn and to grow?
But when we fixate on our fears about it, we forget a really major point, and that is, that kids are living in the same world that we live in, the world where the grownups check their phones more than 50 times a day.
Screens are a part of children's lives.
And if we pretend that they aren't, or if we get overwhelmed by our fear, kids are never going to learn how and why to use them.
What if we start raising our expectations for this media?
What if we start talking to kids regularly about the content on these screens?
What if we start looking for the positive impacts that this technology can have in our children's lives?
That's when the potential of these tools can become a reality. Thank you.
(Applause)
So there's a lot of valid concern these days that our technology is getting so smart that we've put ourselves on the path to a jobless future.
And I think the example of a self-driving car is actually the easiest one to see.
So these are going to be fantastic for all kinds of different reasons.
To put that in perspective, that's three times as many jobs lost in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
And it's not just blue-collar jobs that are at risk.
On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley, we are seeing tremendous gains in the quality of analysis and decision-making because of machine learning.
So even the smartest, highest-paid people will be affected by this change.
What's clear is that no matter what your job is, at least some, if not all of your work, is going to be done by a robot or software in the next few years.
And that's exactly why people like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are talking about the need for government-funded minimum income levels.
But if our politicians can't agree on things like health care or even school lunches, I just don't see a path where they'll find consensus on something as big and as expensive as universal basic life income.
Instead, I think the response needs to be led by us in industry.
We have to recognize the change that's ahead of us and start to design the new kinds of jobs that will still be relevant in the age of robotics.
The good news is that we have faced down and recovered two mass extinctions of jobs before.
From 1870 to 1970, the percent of American workers based on farms fell by 90 percent, and then again from 1950 to 2010, the percent of Americans working in factories fell by 75 percent.
The challenge we face this time, however, is one of time.
We had a hundred years to move from farms to factories, and then 60 years to fully build out a service economy.
But I don't think it has to be this way.
You see, I work in innovation, and part of my job is to shape how large companies apply new technologies. Certainly some of these technologies are even specifically designed to replace human workers.
But I believe that if we start taking steps right now to change the nature of work, we can not only create environments where people love coming to work but also generate the innovation that we need to replace the millions of jobs that will be lost to technology.
I believe that the key to preventing our jobless future is to rediscover what makes us human, and to create a new generation of human-centered jobs that allow us to unlock the hidden talents and passions that we carry with us every day.
But first, I think it's important to recognize that we brought this problem on ourselves.
And it's not just because, you know, we are the one building the robots.
But even though most jobs left the factory decades ago, we still hold on to this factory mindset of standardization and de-skilling.
We still define jobs around procedural tasks and then pay people for the number of hours that they perform these tasks.
We've created narrow job definitions like cashier, loan processor or taxi driver and then asked people to form entire careers around these singular tasks.
These choices have left us with actually two dangerous side effects.
The first is that these narrowly defined jobs will be the first to be displaced by robots, because single-task robots are just the easiest kinds to build.
But second, we have accidentally made it so that millions of workers around the world have unbelievably boring working lives.
(Laughter) Let's take the example of a call center agent. Over the last few decades, we brag about lower operating costs because we've taken most of the need for brainpower out of the person and put it into the system.
For most of their day, they click on screens, they read scripts.
They act more like machines than humans.
And unfortunately, over the next few years, as our technology gets more advanced, they, along with people like clerks and bookkeepers, will see the vast majority of their work disappear.
To counteract this, we have to start creating new jobs that are less centered on the tasks that a person does and more focused on the skills that a person brings to work.
For example, robots are great at repetitive and constrained work, but human beings have an amazing ability to bring together capability with creativity when faced with problems that we've never seen before.
It's when every day brings a little bit of a surprise that we have designed work for humans and not for robots.
Our entrepreneurs and engineers already live in this world, but so do our nurses and our plumbers and our therapists.
You know, it's the nature of too many companies and organizations to just ask people to come to work and do your job.
But if you work is better done by a robot, or your decisions better made by an AI, what are you supposed to be doing?
Well, I think for the manager, we need to realistically think about the tasks that will be disappearing over the next few years and start planning for more meaningful, more valuable work that should replace it.
We need to create environments where both human beings and robots thrive.
I say, let's give more work to the robots, and let's start with the work that we absolutely hate doing.
Here, robot, process this painfully idiotic report.
(Laughter) And move this box.
Thank you.
(Laughter) And for the human beings, we should follow the advice from Harry Davis at the University of Chicago.
He says we have to make it so that people don't leave too much of themselves in the trunk of their car.
I mean, human beings are amazing on weekends.
Think about the people that you know and what they do on Saturdays.
They're artists, carpenters, chefs and athletes.
So my team and I designed a prototyping contest that invited anyone to build anything that they wanted.
We were actually trying to figure out whether or not the primary limiter to innovation was a lack of ideas or a lack of talent, and it turns out it was neither one.
It was an empowerment problem.
And the results of the program were amazing.
We started by inviting people to reenvision what it is they could bring to a team.
This contest was not only a chance to build anything that you wanted but also be anything that you wanted.
And when people were no longer limited by their day-to-day job titles, they felt free to bring all kinds of different skills and talents to the problems that they were trying to solve.
We saw technology people being designers, marketing people being architects, and even finance people showing off their ability to write jokes.
(Laughter) We ran this program twice, and each time more than 400 people brought their unexpected talents to work and solved problems that they had been wanting to solve for years.
" And that's the key. For those few weeks, people got to be creators and innovators.
They had been dreaming of solutions to problems that had been bugging them for years, and this was a chance to turn those dreams into a reality.
And that dreaming is an important part of what separates us from machines.
For now, our machines do not get frustrated, they do not get annoyed, and they certainly don't imagine.
But we, as human beings -- we feel pain, we get frustrated.
And it's when we're most annoyed and most curious that we're motivated to dig into a problem and create change.
Our imaginations are the birthplace of new products, new services, and even new industries.
I believe that the jobs of the future will come from the minds of people who today we call analysts and specialists, but only if we give them the freedom and protection that they need to grow into becoming explorers and inventors.
If we really want to robot-proof our jobs, we, as leaders, need to get out of the mindset of telling people what to do and instead start asking them what problems they're inspired to solve and what talents they want to bring to work.
Because when you can bring your Saturday self to work on Wednesdays, you'll look forward to Mondays more, and those feelings that we have about Mondays are part of what makes us human.
And as we redesign work for an era of intelligent machines, I invite you all to work alongside me to bring more humanity to our working lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
" When we ask that, students will instantly tell you that their cat or dog has a brain, and most will say that a mouse or even a small insect has a brain, but almost nobody says that a plant or a tree or a shrub has a brain.
And that's absolutely correct.
Our nervous system evolved because it is electrical.
It's fast, so we can quickly respond to stimuli in the world and move if we need to. But you can go back and push back on a student, and say, "Well, you know, you say that plants don't have brains, but plants do move.
" Anyone who has grown a plant has noticed that the plant will move and face the sun. But they'll say, "But that's a slow movement.
You know, that doesn't count.
That could be a chemical process.
" But what about fast-moving plants?
He called it the most wonderful plant in the world.
This is a plant that was an evolutionary wonder.
This is a plant that moves quickly, which is rare, and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.
And this is in the same plant.
But I'm here today to tell you that's not even the coolest thing about this plant.
The coolest thing is that the plant can count.
So in order to show that, we have to get some vocabulary out of the way. So I'm going to do what we do in the classroom with students.
We're going to do an experiment on electrophysiology, which is the recording of the body's electrical signal, either coming from neurons or from muscles.
And I'm putting some electrodes here on my wrists. As I hook them up, we're going to be able to see a signal on the screen here.
And this signal may be familiar to you.
It's called the EKG, or the electrocardiogram.
And this is coming from neurons in my heart that are firing what's called action potentials, potential meaning voltage and action meaning it moves quickly up and down, which causes my heart to fire, which then causes the signal that you see here.
And so I want you to remember the shape of what we'll be looking at right here, because this is going to be important.
This is a way that the brain encodes information in the form of an action potential.
So now let's turn to some plants.
So I'm going to first introduce you to the mimosa, not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica, and this is a plant that's found in Central America and South America, and it has behaviors.
And the first behavior I'm going to show you is if I touch the leaves here, you get to see that the leaves tend to curl up. And then the second behavior is, if I tap the leaf, the entire branch seems to fall down.
So why does it do that?
It's not really known to science. One of the reasons why could be that it scares away insects or it looks less appealing to herbivores.
But how does it do that?
Now, that's interesting.
We can do an experiment to find out. So what we're going to do now, just like I recorded the electrical potential from my body, we're going to record the electrical potential from this plant, this mimosa.
And so what we're going to do is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem, and I've got the ground electrode where?
In the ground.
It's an electrical engineering joke. Alright. (Laughter) Alright.
So I'm going to go ahead and tap the leaf here, and I want you to look at the electrical recording that we're going to see inside the plant. Whoa. It is so big, I've got to scale it down.
Alright. So what is that?
Because it wanted to move.
Right?
And so when I hit the touch receptors, it sent a voltage all the way down to the end of the stem, which caused it to move.
Alright?
But can it do more?
So let's go to find out. We're going to go to our good friend, the Venus flytrap here, and we're going to take a look at what happens inside the leaf when a fly lands on here.
So I'm going to pretend to be a fly right now.
And now here's my Venus flytrap, and inside the leaf, you're going to notice that there are three little hairs here, and those are trigger hairs.
And so when a fly lands -- I'm going to touch one of the hairs right now. Ready?
One, two, three.
What do we get?
We get a beautiful action potential.
However, the flytrap doesn't close.
And to understand why that is, we need to know a little bit more about the behavior of the flytrap.
Number one is that it takes a long time to open the traps back up -- you know, about 24 to 48 hours if there's no fly inside of it.
And so it takes a lot of energy.
And two, it doesn't need to eat that many flies throughout the year.
Only a handful. It gets most of its energy from the sun.
It's just trying to replace some nutrients in the ground with flies.
And the third thing is, it only opens then closes the traps a handful of times until that trap dies.
So therefore, it wants to make really darn sure that there's a meal inside of it before the flytrap snaps shut.
So how does it do that?
So we're going to go back now.
I'm going to touch the Venus flytrap again.
I've been talking for more than 20 seconds.
So we can see what happens when I touch the hair a second time.
So what do we get?
We get a second action potential, but again, the leaf doesn't close.
So now if I go back in there and if I'm a fly moving around, I'm going to be touching the leaf a few times.
I'm going to go and brush it a few times.
And immediately, the flytrap closes.
So here we are seeing the flytrap actually doing a computation.
It's determining if there's a fly inside the trap, and then it closes.
So let's go back to our original question.
Do plants have brains?
Well, the answer is no.
There's no brains in here.
There's no axons, no neurons.
It doesn't get depressed.
It doesn't want to know what the Tigers' score is.
It doesn't have self-actualization problems.
But what it does have is something that's very similar to us, which is the ability to communicate using electricity.
It just uses slightly different ions than we do, but it's actually doing the same thing.
So just to show you the ubiquitous nature of these action potentials, we saw it in the Venus flytrap, we've seen an action potential in the mimosa. We've even seen an action potential in a human. Now, this is the euro of the brain.
It's the way that all information is passed. And so what we can do is we can use those action potentials to pass information between species of plants.
And so this is our interspecies plant-to-plant communicator, and what we've done is we've created a brand new experiment where we're going to record the action potential from a Venus flytrap, and we're going to send it into the sensitive mimosa.
So I want you to recall what happens when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.
It has touch receptors that are sending that information back down in the form of an action potential. And so what would happen if we took the action potential from the Venus flytrap and sent it into all the stems of the mimosa?
We should be able to create the behavior of the mimosas without actually touching it ourselves.
And so if you'll allow me, I'm going to go ahead and trigger this mimosa right now by touching on the hairs of the Venus flytrap.
So we're going to send information about touch from one plant to another.
So there you see it.
So -- (Applause) So I hope you learned a little bit, something about plants today, and not only that.
You learned that plants could be used to help teach neuroscience and bring along the neurorevolution.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What are you doing on this stage in front of all these people?
(Laughter) Run! (Laughter) Run now.
That's the voice of my anxiety talking. Even when there's absolutely nothing wrong, I sometimes get this overwhelming sense of doom, like danger is lurking just around the corner.
So, I teach college students about inequality and race in education, and I like to leave my office open to any of my students who might just want to see me to chat.
And so I started to remember that I know that feeling of being an outsider in your own community.
(Laughter) That's because school is in the morning, and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.
(Laughter) Curry is for dinner. (Laughter) So when Mahari was leaving, I asked him how he was coping with feeling isolated.
And he said that despite feeling lonely, he just threw himself at his work, that he built strategies around his grit and his desire to be successful.
But sometimes grit isn't enough, especially in education.
So when Mahari was leaving my office, I worried that he might need something more specific to combat the challenges that he mentioned to me.
Students from low-income, often single-parent households, students who have been homeless, incarcerated or perhaps undocumented, or some who have struggled with substance abuse or lived through violent or sexual trauma.
So let me tell you about two of the grittiest people I've met.
Tyrique was raised by a single mother, and then after high school, he fell in with the wrong crowd.
He got arrested for armed robbery.
But in prison, he started to work hard.
He took college credit courses, so when he got out, he was able to get a master's, and today he's a manager at a nonprofit.
Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid, from the Lower East Side to Staten Island to the Bronx.
She was raised primarily by her extended family, because her own mother had a heroin addiction.
Yet at 15, Vanessa had to drop out of school, and she had a son of her own.
But eventually, she was able to go to community college, get her associate's, then go to an elite college to finish her bachelor's.
So some people might hear these stories and say, "Yes, those two definitely have grit.
They basically pulled themselves up by the bootstraps.
" But that's an incomplete picture, because what's more important is that they had factors in their lives that helped to influence their agency, or their specific capacity to actually overcome the obstacles that they were facing and navigate the system given their circumstances.
So, allow me to elaborate. In prison, Tyrique was actually aimless at first, as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.
This is until an older detainee took him aside and asked him to help with the youth program.
And in mentoring youth, he started to see his own mistakes and possibilities in the teens.
This is what got him interested in taking college-credit courses.
And when he got out, he got a job with Fortune Society, where many executives are people who have been formerly incarcerated.
So then he was able to get a master's in social work, and today, he even lectures at Columbia about prison reform.
And Vanessa . . . well, after the birth of her son, she happened to find a program called Vocational Foundation that gave her 20 dollars biweekly, a MetroCard and her first experiences with a computer.
These simple resources are what helped her get her GED, but then she suffered from a very serious kidney failure, which was particularly problematic because she was only born with one kidney.
She spent 10 years on dialysis waiting for a successful transplant.
After that, her mentors at community college had kept in touch with her, and so she was able to go, and they put her in an honors program.
And that's the pathway that allowed her to become accepted to one of the most elite colleges for women in the country, and she received her bachelor's at 36, setting an incredible example for her young son.
What these stories primarily indicate is that teaching is social and benefits from social scaffolding.
There were factors pushing these two in one direction, but through tailored mentorship and opportunities, they were able to reflect on their circumstances and resist negative influences.
They also learned simple skills like developing a network, or asking for help -- things many of us in this room can forget that we have needed from time to time, or can take for granted.
And when we think of people like this, we should only think of them as exceptional, but not as exceptions.
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us of the collective responsibility to help students in similar situations. When Presidents Bush, Obama and now even Trump, have called education "the civil rights issue of our time," perhaps we should treat it that way.
If schools were able to think about the agency that their students have and bring to the table when they push them, what students learn can become more relevant to their lives, and then they can tap into those internal reservoirs of grit and character.
So this here -- My student Mahari got accepted to law school with scholarships, and not to brag, but I did write one of his letters of recommendation.
(Laughter) And even though I know hard work is what got him this achievement, I've seen him find his voice along the way, which as someone who's grown up a little bit shy and awkward, I know it takes time and support.
Thank you.
(Applause)So, I teach college students about inequality and race in education, and I like to leave my office open to any of my students who might just want to see me to chat.
And so I started to remember that I know that feeling of being an outsider in your own community.

But sometimes grit isn't enough, especially in education.
So when Mahari was leaving my office, I worried that he might need something more specific to combat the challenges that he mentioned to me.
As a sociologist, I also study achievement, but from a slightly different perspective.
I research students who have overcome immense obstacles related to their background.
Students from low-income, often single-parent households, students who have been homeless, incarcerated or perhaps undocumented, or some who have struggled with substance abuse or lived through violent or sexual trauma.
So let me tell you about two of the grittiest people I've met.

He took college credit courses, so when he got out, he was able to get a master's, and today he's a manager at a nonprofit.
Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid, from the Lower East Side to Staten Island to the Bronx.
She was raised primarily by her extended family, because her own mother had a heroin addiction.
Yet at 15, Vanessa had to drop out of school, and she had a son of her own.
But eventually, she was able to go to community college, get her associate's, then go to an elite college to finish her bachelor's.
So some people might hear these stories and say, "Yes, those two definitely have grit.
They basically pulled themselves up by the bootstraps.
" But that's an incomplete picture, because what's more important is that they had factors in their lives that helped to influence their agency, or their specific capacity to actually overcome the obstacles that they were facing and navigate the system given their circumstances.
So, allow me to elaborate. In prison, Tyrique was actually aimless at first, as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.
This is until an older detainee took him aside and asked him to help with the youth program.
And in mentoring youth, he started to see his own mistakes and possibilities in the teens.
This is what got him interested in taking college-credit courses.
And when he got out, he got a job with Fortune Society, where many executives are people who have been formerly incarcerated.
So then he was able to get a master's in social work, and today, he even lectures at Columbia about prison reform.
And Vanessa . . . well, after the birth of her son, she happened to find a program called Vocational Foundation that gave her 20 dollars biweekly, a MetroCard and her first experiences with a computer.
These simple resources are what helped her get her GED, but then she suffered from a very serious kidney failure, which was particularly problematic because she was only born with one kidney.
She spent 10 years on dialysis waiting for a successful transplant.
After that, her mentors at community college had kept in touch with her, and so she was able to go, and they put her in an honors program.
And that's the pathway that allowed her to become accepted to one of the most elite colleges for women in the country, and she received her bachelor's at 36, setting an incredible example for her young son.
What these stories primarily indicate is that teaching is social and benefits from social scaffolding.
There were factors pushing these two in one direction, but through tailored mentorship and opportunities, they were able to reflect on their circumstances and resist negative influences.
They also learned simple skills like developing a network, or asking for help -- things many of us in this room can forget that we have needed from time to time, or can take for granted.
And when we think of people like this, we should only think of them as exceptional, but not as exceptions.
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us of the collective responsibility to help students in similar situations. When Presidents Bush, Obama and now even Trump, have called education "the civil rights issue of our time," perhaps we should treat it that way.
If schools were able to think about the agency that their students have and bring to the table when they push them, what students learn can become more relevant to their lives, and then they can tap into those internal reservoirs of grit and character.
So this here -- My student Mahari got accepted to law school with scholarships, and not to brag, but I did write one of his letters of recommendation.
(Laughter) And even though I know hard work is what got him this achievement, I've seen him find his voice along the way, which as someone who's grown up a little bit shy and awkward, I know it takes time and support.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We humans are becoming an urban species, so cities, they are our natural habitat.
That is where we live.
In 2014, over 54 percent of the world population was living in cities, and I can bet you that so many of these people have thought of how they would do things differently, like if I only had the tools to change things in my city, what would I do?
What would my dream city be like?
And these tools, this is just what we gave them.
Two years ago, my team and I, we released a game, "Cities: Skylines.
" It is a game about building cities.
So I have always been interested in cities as systems.
It's something that I find immensely interesting.
But what I didn't understand was that I am not alone in this.
People love cities.
They are interested.
They have ideas.
The game was an instant hit.
So far, over three and a half million people have played it.
And it's not just about playing. We also have really awesome sharing systems.
So the game is about self-expression, creativity, not just overcoming the challenges posed by the simulation.
It is about showing what your cities look like.
So I have a couple of videos. These are from YouTube.
And these are some of the most interesting city designs I have seen.
So they are all different, and I hope you like all of these.
This one is called The Netherlands. It's by Silvarret.
And when you start the game, you have an empty piece of land.
This is a fantasy city, even though it looks real.
So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city that could be in the Netherlands.
So he kind of investigated what are the characteristics of cities in the Netherlands and combined a couple of those, and this is what he created.
So it is a city, but it is not a real city, but it could be.
It looks just like the Netherlands.
So the places are really densely populated.
So what you need is highways, trains, anything connecting these small town centers together.
Lots of people, lots of moving, so transportation is the key here.
But then let's go even more on the fantasy side.
Let's go into the future.
This is one of my personal favorites.
These city designs are what I love the most.
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd, and the basic idea is that you have concentric circle routes.
So the city is a big circle with tinier circles inside.
And the thing is that you put all of the services in the center, and then people actually live on the outer ring, because there is less traffic, less noise, less pollution, so that is where you want to live.
But the services are still really close by.
They are in the center.
And this is the soul of the game.
The player has to understand what are the wishes, what are the needs of the tiny people living in the cities.
So you need to know where you should put the things.
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.
It needs to be accessible.
Citizens need to reach the hospital. And this is one way to do it.
So maybe this is something that we might be seeing someday.
And then even more into the future.
Astergea by Yuttho.
So Yuttho does YouTube videos and plays the game.
What he did here was actually a 12-point series of creating this city.
So what he does is he plays the game, he records it and he explains as he's going what he's doing and why.
And as a part of this series, he actually did an interview with an actual urban planner called Jeff Speck.
And Speck is an expert on the concept of walkability.
The basic idea is that if you want your citizens to walk, which is kind of beneficial, you actually need to have walking as a reasonable means of transportation.
It should be a good way to reach places.
So what Yuttho did was that he explained this concept, he had Speck explain it, too, and then he applied it to the city that he was building.
So what we are seeing is Yuttho's vision of the future: lots of public transportation, walkways, plazas, connecting high-rise buildings.
Maybe this is what the future might look like.
And the game system works really well for this.
We are seeing some real-world uses to this game.
If we build a new road, would it help?
And this is what you can do with this game.
There was one really interesting contest held by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.
So what they did was that they had a new area that they wanted to develop in the city.
They made a map with the existing city, they left empty the area that they would want to develop and shared this map.
So anyone could download the map, play the game, build the area and submit their creations to the city council.
So they have not yet built anything, but it might just be that they use one of these plans made with the game to actually build the real city.
And these videos that I have shown you, these are the people who are coming up with new kinds of solutions.
We know that cities are growing.
They're getting bigger as we go, and the percentage of population living in cities is projected to rise.
So we need the solutions and these people, playing the game, they are trying out different kinds of solutions.
They might have something that is really important.
So what we are seeing here is dream cities that might be real one day.
So it might be that this is not just a game.
It might be a way to decide our own fate.

This is a picture of a sunset on Mars taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013. Mars is a very cold planet, flooded with high levels of UV radiation and extremely dry.
In fact, Mars is considered to be too dry for life as we know it.
I'm an astrobiologist. I try to understand the origin of life on Earth and the possibilities of finding life elsewhere in the universe.
People sometimes ask me, how can you be an astrobiologist if you don't have your own spaceship?
Well, what I do is that I study life in those environments on Earth that most closely resemble other interesting places in the universe.
All life on Earth requires water, so in my case I focus on the intimate relationship between water and life in order to understand if we could find life in a planet as dry as Mars.
But since I do not have the 2.5 billion dollars to send my own robot to Mars, I study the most Martian place on Earth, the Atacama Desert.
Located in northern Chile, it is the oldest and driest desert on Earth.
To give you an idea of how dry it is, consider here in Vancouver it rains over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.
In the Atacama, there are places with no reported rains in the last 400 years.
How do I know this?
Well, because I was born and raised in the Atacama -- (Laughter) So I had a unique advantage when I started studying this desert.
So let me tell you guys a few fantastic examples he has found on how life has adapted to live with almost no water at all.
One of my first findings was in the entrance of a cave facing the Pacific Ocean.
In this place, we reported a new type of microalgae that grew only on top of the spiderwebs that covered the cave entrance.
Have you ever seen a spiderweb early in the morning?
It's covered with dew, so this microalgae learned that in order to carry photosynthesis in the coast of the driest desert on Earth, they could use the spiderwebs.
So here they may access the water from the fogs that regularly cover these areas in the morning.
In another cave, we found a different type of microalgae.
This one is able to use ocean mist as a source of water, and strikingly lives in the very bottom of a cave, so it has adapted to live with less than 0.1 percent of the amount of light that regular plants need.
These type of findings suggest to me that on Mars, we may find even photosynthetic life inside caves.
And by the way, that's me.
(Laughter) Now, for almost 15 years this region of Yungay, discovered by NASA, was thought to be the driest place of this desert, but I knew that it was not.
How?
You already know the answer.
Because I was born and raised in this desert.
Now, in this search, we were trying to actually find the dry limit for life on Earth, a place so dry that nothing was able to survive in it.
But even here, well hidden underground, we found a number of different microorganisms, which suggested to me that similarly dry places, like Mars, may be inhabited.
We even have some preliminary evidences that these microorganisms may still be active in the desiccated state, like walking mummies all around us, and that they may be using UV radiation as a source of energy.
If confirmed, this would have a huge impact on our definition of life, on how we look for life elsewhere in the universe.
Due to its clear skies, by 2020, 60 percent of the biggest telescopes on Earth will be located in the Atacama, and while everyone else will be looking among the stars to answer the question, "Are we alone?
" I will be looking down to the ground searching for this same answer in my own backyard.
Thank you.
(Applause)This is a picture of a sunset on Mars taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013. Mars is a very cold planet, flooded with high levels of UV radiation and extremely dry.

They rallied behind him.
But what I am saying is that we need to look at the bigger picture.
If you are within the sound of my voice, I want you to close your eyes for a moment and examine your own social circle. Who are your foreign-born?
What would it feel like if the circle were broken?
Share your story.
I'm building a global archive of first-person accounts and linking them with mapping technology, so that we can see exactly where these circles break, because this is not just an American issue.
There are a quarter-billion migrants around the world; people living, loving and learning in countries where they were not born.
Thank you.
(Applause)So, Ma was trying to explain something to me about Grandma and when they grew up, but I couldn't pay attention to her because I was five years old, and I was petrified.
I had just seen The Green Lady.
Now, about a week earlier, I'd watched that movie "Godzilla," the one about that huge lizard-like beast storming a major city, and the thought of a green monster coming for me was stuck in my mind.
And yet there I was, at the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom, just staring at her: her horns, her muscles -- all of it just frightened me.
And I didn't know whether she was a monster or a hero.
So I decided to consult the Google of the day -- "Ma!
Ma!
" (Laughter) My mother explained that The Green Lady is actually the Statue of Liberty and that she was waving immigrants in.
Now, the part of her explanation that really messed with my young head was the fact that, according to Ma, long before us, The Green Lady was actually brown, brown like me, and that she changed colors over the years, much like America.
Now, the part that really is intriguing about this is that when she changed colors, she made me think about myself.
It all made sense to me, because as a first-generation American, I was surrounded by immigrants.
In fact, within my immediate social circle of the people who support me, who enrich my life, at least two are foreign-born.
My life as a US citizen is in many ways shaped by newcomers, and chances are, so is yours.
There are more than 40 million immigrants in the USA.
According to census data, a quarter of the nation's children have at least one foreign-born parent.
I know all these statistics because I study global migration patterns.
I'm a journalist, and for the last few years, I've been documenting the lives of US citizens who've lost people to deportation.
And the numbers are enormous.
From 2008 to 2016, more than three million people were "ordered removed" -- that's the technical term for being deported.
There is an economic, a political, a psychological and an emotional cost to those deportations -- the moments when these circles are broken.
I once asked a US soldier, "Why did you volunteer to fight this war?
" And she told me, "Because I'm proud to defend my country.
" But I pressed to know -- "Really, when you're on base, and you hear bombs exploding in the distance, and you see soldiers coming back who are gravely injured, in that moment, when you know you could be next, what does 'my country' mean?
" She looked at me.
"My country is my wife, my family, my friends, my soldiers.
We're missing a crucial aspect in the debate about immigration policy.
And it's not just the children of the deported who are impacted.
There are 23 million noncitizens in the USA, according to verifiable federal data. And that doesn't include the undocumented, because numbers for that population are at best complex estimates.
I'm building a global archive of first-person accounts and linking them with mapping technology, so that we can see exactly where these circles break, because this is not just an American issue.
(Applause)
I'd like for you to take a moment to imagine this with me. You're a little girl of five years old. Sitting in front of a mirror, you ask yourself, "Do I exist?
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?
Walking down the street, what does the city you live in say to you?
What symbols are present?
Which histories are celebrated?
And on the other hand, which ones are omitted?
About an hour still?
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?
Walking down the street, what does the city you live in say to you?
What symbols are present?
Which histories are celebrated?
And on the other hand, which ones are omitted?
About an hour still?
When someone mentions Cuba, what do you think about?
Classic, classic cars?
Perhaps good cigars?
Maybe you think of a famous baseball player.
What about when somebody mentions North Korea?
You think about those missile tests, maybe their notorious leader or his good friend, Dennis Rodman.
(Laughter) One thing that likely doesn't come to mind is a vision of a country, an open economy, whose citizens have access to a wide range of affordable consumer products. I'm not here to argue how these countries got to where they are today.
I simply want to use them as an example of countries and citizens who have been affected, negatively affected, by a trade policy that restricts imports and protects local industries.
Recently we've heard a number of countries talk about restricting imports and protecting their local, domestic industries.
Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite, but what it really is is protectionism.
We heard a lot about this during the 2016 presidential election.
We heard about it during the Brexit debates and most recently during the French elections.
In fact, it's been a really important topic being talked about around the world, and many aspiring political leaders are running on platforms positioning protectionism as a good thing.
Now, I could see why they think protectionism is good, because sometimes it seems like trade is unfair.
Some have blamed trade for some of the problems we've been having here at home in the US.
For years we've been hearing about the loss of high-paying US manufacturing jobs. Many think that manufacturing is declining in the US because companies are moving their operations offshore to markets with lower-cost labor like China, Mexico and Vietnam.
They also think trade agreements sometimes are unfair, like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because these trade agreements allow companies to reimport those cheaply produced goods back into the US and other countries from where the jobs were taken.
So it kind of feels like the exporters win and the importers lose.
Now, the reality is output in the manufacturing sector in the US is actually growing, but we are losing jobs.
We're losing lots of them. In fact, from 2000 to 2010, 5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.
But they're not being lost for the reasons you might think.
Mike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio didn't lose his jobs at the factory to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico. No. Mike lost his job to a machine.
87 percent of lost manufacturing jobs have been eliminated because we've made improvements in our own productivity through automation.
So that means that one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs was due to offshoring.
Now, this is not just a US phenomenon. No. In fact, automation is spreading to every production line in every country around the world.
But look, I get it: if you just lost your job and then you read in the newspaper that your old company just struck up a deal with China, it's easy to think you were just replaced in a one-for-one deal.
When I hear stories like this, I think that what people picture is that trade happens between only two countries.
Manufacturers in one country produce products and they export them to consumers in other countries, and it feels like the manufacturing countries win and the importing countries lose.
Well, reality's a little bit different. I'm a supply chain professional, and I live and work in Mexico.
And I work in the middle of a highly connected network of manufacturers all collaborating from around the world to produce many of the products we use today.
What I see from my front-row seat in Mexico City actually looks more like this.
And this is a more accurate depiction of what trade really looks like.
I've had the pleasure of being able to see how many different products are manufactured, from golf clubs to laptop computers to internet servers, automobiles and even airplanes.
And believe me, none of it happens in a straight line.
These new airplanes, before they even take their first flight, they have more stamps in their passports than Angelina Jolie.
You might be surprised to find a label that looks like this one: "Manufactured in the USA from US and foreign parts.
So what he's talking about here is shared production, and efficiency is the name of the game.
The general contractor selects experts because it takes years to learn and master how to do each of the tasks it takes to build a house or renovate a kitchen, some of them requiring special training.
Think about it: Would you want your architect to install your toilet?
Of course not.
So let's apply this process to the corporate world.
Companies today focus on manufacturing what they produce best and most efficiently, and they trade for everything else.
So this means they rely on a global, interconnected, interdependent network of manufacturers to produce these products.
Now, don't kid yourself, these costs are going to be passed along to you and to me.
Now, remember, this is only looking at one strand of the production chain between the US and Mexico, so multiply this out across all of the strands.
What about when somebody mentions North Korea?
We heard a lot about this during the 2016 presidential election.
We heard about it during the Brexit debates and most recently during the French elections.
Now, the reality is output in the manufacturing sector in the US is actually growing, but we are losing jobs.
We're losing lots of them. In fact, from 2000 to 2010, 5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.

And believe me, none of it happens in a straight line.
Let me give you an example.
These new airplanes, before they even take their first flight, they have more stamps in their passports than Angelina Jolie.
Now, this approach to processing goes on all around the world to manufacture many of the products we use every day, from skin cream to airplanes.
When you go home tonight, take a look in your house.
You might be surprised to find a label that looks like this one: "Manufactured in the USA from US and foreign parts.
" Economist Michael Porter described what's going on here best.
Many decades ago, he said that it's most beneficial for a country to focus on producing the products it can produce most efficiently and trading for the rest.
So what he's talking about here is shared production, and efficiency is the name of the game.
You've probably seen an example of this at home or at work.
Let's take a look at an example.
Think about how your house was built or your kitchen renovated. Typically, there's a general contractor who is responsible for coordinating the efforts of all the different contractors: an architect to draw the plans, an earth-moving company to dig the foundation, a plumber, a carpenter and so on.
So why doesn't the general contractor pick just one company to do all the work, like, say, the architect?
Because this is silly.
The general contractor selects experts because it takes years to learn and master how to do each of the tasks it takes to build a house or renovate a kitchen, some of them requiring special training.
So let's apply this process to the corporate world.
Companies today focus on manufacturing what they produce best and most efficiently, and they trade for everything else.
So this means they rely on a global, interconnected, interdependent network of manufacturers to produce these products.
In fact, that network is so interconnected it's almost impossible to dismantle and produce products in just one country.
So let's just imagine that the US decides to impose a 20 percent border tax on all imports from Mexico.
OK, fine.
But do you think Mexico is just going to stand by and let that happen? No. No way.
Now, don't kid yourself, these costs are going to be passed along to you and to me.
Now, let's think about what impact that might have on some of the products, or the prices of the products, that we buy every day.
So if a 30 percent increase in duties were actually passed along, we would be looking at some pretty important increases in prices.
A Lincoln MKZ would go from 37,000 dollars to 48,000. And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV would go from 898 dollars to 1,167 dollars.
And the price of a 16-ounce jar of CVS skin moisturizer would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.
Now, remember, this is only looking at one strand of the production chain between the US and Mexico, so multiply this out across all of the strands.
The impact could be considerable.
Now, just think about this: even if we were able to dismantle this network and produce products in just one country, which by the way is easier said than done, we would still only be saving or protecting one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.
That's right, because remember, most of those jobs, 87 percent, were lost due to improvements in our own productivity.
And unfortunately, those jobs, they're gone for good.
So the real question is, does it make sense for us to drive up prices to the point where many of us can't afford the basic goods we use every day for the purpose of saving a job that might be eliminated in a couple of years anyway?
The reality is that shared production allows us to manufacture higher quality products at lower costs.
It's that simple.
It allows us to get more out of the limited resources and expertise we have and at the same time benefit from lower prices. It's really important to remember that for shared production to be effective, it relies on efficient cross-border movement of raw materials, components and finished products.
So remember this: the next time you're hearing somebody try to sell you on the idea that protectionism is a good deal, it's just not. Thank you.
(Applause)
Namaste. I'm from India.
The home of ancient mathematics.
But me, I just hated math.
(Laughter) Until it saved my life. I grew up in Akola, a small town 700 miles away from the capital city.
In my community, we never had a culture of girls attending school beyond the age of 10 or 12 years.
In fact, some women would tell me, "Why do you need education?
Just learn the household work so that you can take care of your family.
" But I never wanted to abide myself by the "normal" rules for girls.
And I would think to myself, instead of just learning the household work, why not learn how to make money so that I can actually take care of my family?
(Laughter) I knew if I had to do something different, I would have to stay in school.
But that was hard.
As it was socially not accepted, everybody was against it.
But I was a stubborn young girl.
I did everything I could to continue studying, even if that meant stitching school uniforms or making festival greeting cards.
I did all that.
Well, I had excellent grades in all subjects.
All except one.
You guessed it: math.
All these calculations, formulas, multiplication; I just couldn't get them right.
After I finished college, I realized I had no future in Akola, so I decided to do something almost nobody in my town had ever done before: to leave my home town, by myself, a single woman.
Nobody wanted me to do that.
I remember when I walked up to my mom and told her, "Mama, I'm leaving.
" She looked at me and said, "Uma, I know how difficult it is for you and even for me, and I cannot even support you openly, but I want you to have this.
" And she hands me a gold bangle.
That was the only jewelry left with her.
She said, "I don't have much but this is for you to buy the bus ticket.
" You can see the bus ticket here.
It's been ten years.
I still have this.
As a promise that I won't let my mom sacrifice anything more for me.
So, on 22nd of July, 2007, I arrived in Pune, a city of four million people.
I had never been out of my village before so being in the city for the first time, I was mesmerized and excited.
And scared as well.
I didn't even know if I could trust the taxi driver while taking the taxi for the first time in an unknown city.
Life in the city was extremely hard at first.
I was away from my family, didn't have any friends.
I had brought very little money with me; around three and a half dollars.
So I used to eat every second day - every other day - so that I can save as much as I can.
Yes, good things take time, but they do happen. And finally, it happened to me.
I was given an opportunity to work in a primary school, as a teacher.
Wow, I was so happy.
Until I got to know the subject they gave me to teach.
(Laughter) Yes, it was math.
(Laughter) And I'm like, "Oh God, how will I teach something I hate so much?
" (Laughter) But I had no choice so I started teaching math.
You know, the basics like multiplication tables.
I remember I struggled every night to figure out lessons for my students.
I was hating it.
And I was afraid if I didn't do well, I might not make it.
But the more I worked on it, trying to make it interesting, trying to make it fun, the more I realized the pattern in these numbers.
(Laughter) Three, we all know it's an odd number.
And if I multiply three with another odd number, it gives me a result which is definitely an odd number.
Like this one here: Three times three gives us nine.
And then I noticed something very interesting about it.
Three times four gives us 12. An even number.
But odd multiplied with something even, no matter how many times you do it, it will definitely give us an even number.
And I'm like, this is quite me.
With all the odds I was up against, if I multiply my odd situation, with my odd behavior . . . (Laughter) (Applause) So what happens?
(Laughter) But the magic is, if I multiply my odd situations with my even behavior, with my positive behavior, it gets me to better results, to even results.
And if one doesn't stop when the situations are odd like this, if one keeps pushing himself, keeps multiplying his blessings, keeps multiplying his skills, even though the beginning is, the end will never be odd.
(Laughter) So, let's look at table of two, for example.
That's possible because the number itself which is getting multiplied, is an even number.
(Laughter) Now this of course doesn't mean I don't come across any odd or bad situations.
But facing them with even attitude makes the whole difference.
Now I have these learnings, these secrets from all different multiplication tables.
And easy, of course.
For me, the question was: How can I have my life this similarly easy and beautiful?
I can live in harmony, I can live in peace only when my outside matches my inner being.
Whoever we are, unless or until our inside personality matches our outside personality, our outside personality matches our inside personality, we cannot live in peace, we cannot live in harmony.
Now, because math became my art, became my reminder, my guide of what I needed to do, and what my goal was, I started loving math.
Just learn the household work so that you can take care of your family.
" But I never wanted to abide myself by the "normal" rules for girls.
(Laughter) I knew if I had to do something different, I would have to stay in school.
" She looked at me and said, "Uma, I know how difficult it is for you and even for me, and I cannot even support you openly, but I want you to have this.
That was the only jewelry left with her.
" You can see the bus ticket here.
As a promise that I won't let my mom sacrifice anything more for me.
So, on 22nd of July, 2007, I arrived in Pune, a city of four million people.
I had never been out of my village before so being in the city for the first time, I was mesmerized and excited.
And scared as well.
I didn't even know if I could trust the taxi driver while taking the taxi for the first time in an unknown city.
Life in the city was extremely hard at first.
I was away from my family, didn't have any friends.
I had brought very little money with me; around three and a half dollars.

I was hating it.
And I was afraid if I didn't do well, I might not make it.
But the more I worked on it, trying to make it interesting, trying to make it fun, the more I realized the pattern in these numbers.
As if these multiplication tables were sending me a message, I sensed as if these numbers were talking to me.
And that's when I figured out the magic these odd and even numbers have; the poetry, the symmetry they have.
Let me show you what I mean: Let's look at table of three for example.
Feels like we are back in school?
(Laughter) Three, we all know it's an odd number.
And if I multiply three with another odd number, it gives me a result which is definitely an odd number.
Like this one here: Three times three gives us nine.
An odd number.
And then I noticed something very interesting about it.
If I multiply an odd number with an even number, it ultimately becomes an even number, like this one here.
Three times four gives us 12. An even number.
So, odd multiplied with odd, the result has to definitely be an odd number.
But odd multiplied with something even, no matter how many times you do it, it will definitely give us an even number.
And I'm like, this is quite me.
With all the odds I was up against, if I multiply my odd situation, with my odd behavior . . . (Laughter) (Applause) So what happens?
I get myself into another odd situation.
(Laughter) But the magic is, if I multiply my odd situations with my even behavior, with my positive behavior, it gets me to better results, to even results.
And if one doesn't stop when the situations are odd like this, if one keeps pushing himself, keeps multiplying his blessings, keeps multiplying his skills, even though the beginning is, the end will never be odd.
Wow, so once I got to know this, I was like, if something odd can teach me such a valuable lesson of life, I'm sure there is something interesting about the even numbers as well.
(Laughter) So, let's look at table of two, for example.
What I notice here is every time, right from the beginning to the end, all multiplication results are even, without any odds.
And how is it possible?
That's possible because the number itself which is getting multiplied, is an even number.
This tells me if I am even to myself, as an individual, nothing odd will come my way.
(Laughter) Now this of course doesn't mean I don't come across any odd or bad situations.
I certainly do.
But facing them with even attitude makes the whole difference.
That's how, even though I have to struggle hard for my basic rights, instead of being upset and angry, I am happy and even to myself, because the struggle made me stronger, made me who I am today.
Now I have these learnings, these secrets from all different multiplication tables.
One of my favorites is table of 11. And I think most of us liked, when we were in school, because that is the easiest one to multiply.
What I love about this is the perfect symmetry in it.
The one and one, the two and two.
Isn't that beautiful?
And easy, of course.
For me, the question was: How can I have my life this similarly easy and beautiful?
For me these two symmetrical numbers reflect the outside me and the inside me.
I can live in harmony, I can live in peace only when my outside matches my inner being.
Isn't this all we're looking for?
We can be anybody; maybe two, maybe three.
Whoever we are, unless or until our inside personality matches our outside personality, our outside personality matches our inside personality, we cannot live in peace, we cannot live in harmony.
Now, because math became my art, became my reminder, my guide of what I needed to do, and what my goal was, I started loving math.
Because of this, I was not only able to keep my job, but also make it interesting for others.
Now ten years down the line, I have a wonderful job in a great company.
I am able to move my entire family to Pune to live with me.
Now nobody says I shouldn't have done this. Rather everyone appreciates for what I stood for.
As kids, we all are asked to solve math problems.
But in reality, math solved many of my problems.
Thank you for having me. Dhanyavaad (Thank you).
(Applause) (Cheers)
How many companies have you interacted with today?
Well, you got up in the morning, took a shower, washed your hair, used a hair dryer, ate breakfast -- ate cereals, fruit, yogurt, whatever -- had coffee -- tea.
You took public transport to come here, or maybe used your private car.
You interacted with the company that you work for or that you own.
You interacted with your clients, your customers, and so on and so forth.
I'm pretty sure there are at least seven companies you've interacted with today.
Let me tell you a stunning statistic.
One out of seven large, public corporations commit fraud every year.
This is a US academic study that looks at US companies -- I have no reason to believe that it's different in Europe.
This is a study that looks at both detected and undetected fraud using statistical methods.
This is not petty fraud.
These frauds cost the shareholders of these companies, and therefore society, on the order of 380 billion dollars per year.
We can all think of some examples, right?
The car industry's secrets aren't quite so secret anymore.
Fraud has become a feature, not a bug, of the financial services industry.
That's not me who's claiming that, that's the president of the American Finance Association who stated that in his presidential address.
That's a huge problem if you think about, especially, an economy like Switzerland, which relies so much on the trust put into its financial industry.
On the other hand, there are six out of seven companies who actually remain honest despite all temptations to start engaging in fraud.
There are whistle-blowers like Michael Woodford, who blew the whistle on Olympus.
These whistle-blowers risk their careers, their friendships, to bring out the truth about their companies.
There are journalists like Anna Politkovskaya who risk even their lives to report human rights violations.
She got killed -- every year, around 100 journalists get killed because of their conviction to bring out the truth.
So in my talk today, I want to share with you some insights I've obtained and learned in the last 10 years of conducting research in this.
I'm a researcher, a scientist working with economists, financial economists, ethicists, neuroscientists, lawyers and others trying to understand what makes humans tick, and how can we address this issue of fraud in corporations and therefore contribute to the improvement of the world.
I want to start by sharing with you two very distinct visions of how people behave.
First, meet Adam Smith, founding father of modern economics.
His basic idea was that if everybody behaves in their own self-interests, that's good for everybody in the end.
Let's think about that.
Think about this dog here.
(Laughter) Now, the straight-up, self-interested move here is to go for that.
So my friend Adam here might jump up, get the sausage and thereby ruin all this beautiful tableware.
But that's not what Adam Smith meant.
He didn't mean disregard all consequences -- to the contrary.
They lose net new money in the future and therefore make lower profits.
That's a very powerful reputational force.
Benefits and costs.
Meet Immanuel Kant, 18th-century German philosopher superstar.
So, meet my friend Immanuel here.
(Laughter) You know what's coming now, right?
But do think about selecting the right people rather than having people and then putting incentives in place.
Selecting the right people with the right values may go a long way to saving a lot of trouble and a lot of money in your organizations.
In other words, it will pay off to put people first.
Thank you.
(Applause)How many companies have you interacted with today?

I want to start by sharing with you two very distinct visions of how people behave.
First, meet Adam Smith, founding father of modern economics.
His basic idea was that if everybody behaves in their own self-interests, that's good for everybody in the end.
Self-interest isn't a narrowly defined concept just for your immediate utility.
It has a long-run implication.
Let's think about that.
Think about this dog here.
That might be us.
There's this temptation -- I apologize to all vegetarians, but -- (Laughter) Dogs do like the bratwurst.
(Laughter) Now, the straight-up, self-interested move here is to go for that.
So my friend Adam here might jump up, get the sausage and thereby ruin all this beautiful tableware.
But that's not what Adam Smith meant.
He didn't mean disregard all consequences -- to the contrary.
He would have thought, well, there may be negative consequences, for example, the owner might be angry with the dog and the dog, anticipating that, might not behave in this way.
That might be us, weighing the benefits and costs of our actions.
How does that play out?
Well, many of you, I'm sure, have in your companies, especially if it's a large company, a code of conduct.
And then if you behave according to that code of conduct, that improves your chances of getting a bonus payment.
And on the other hand, if you disregard it, then there are higher chances of not getting your bonus or its being diminished.
In other words, this is a very economic motivation of trying to get people to be more honest, or more aligned with the corporation's principles.
Similarly, reputation is a very powerful economic force, right?
We try to build a reputation, maybe for being honest, because then people trust us more in the future.
Right?
Adam Smith talked about the baker who's not producing good bread out of his benevolence for those people who consume the bread, but because he wants to sell more future bread.
In my research, we find, for example, at the University of Zurich, that Swiss banks who get caught up in media, and in the context, for example, of tax evasion, of tax fraud, have bad media coverage.
They lose net new money in the future and therefore make lower profits.
That's a very powerful reputational force.
Benefits and costs.
Here's another viewpoint of the world.
Meet Immanuel Kant, 18th-century German philosopher superstar.
He developed this notion that independent of the consequences, some actions are just right and some are just wrong.
It's just wrong to lie, for example.
So, meet my friend Immanuel here.
He knows that the sausage is very tasty, but he's going to turn away because he's a good dog.
He knows it's wrong to jump up and risk ruining all this beautiful tableware.
If you believe that people are motivated like that, then all the stuff about incentives, all the stuff about code of conduct and bonus systems and so on, doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
People are motivated by different values perhaps.
So, what are people actually motivated by?
These two gentlemen here have perfect hairdos, but they give us very different views of the world.
What do we do with this?
Well, I'm an economist and we conduct so-called experiments to address this issue.
We strip away facts which are confusing in reality.
Reality is so rich, there is so much going on, it's almost impossible to know what drives people's behavior really.
So let's do a little experiment together.
Imagine the following situation.
You're in a room alone, not like here.
There's a five-franc coin like the one I'm holding up right now in front of you.
Here are your instructions: toss the coin four times, and then on a computer terminal in front of you, enter the number of times tails came up.
This is the situation.
Here's the rub.
For every time that you announce that you had a tails throw, you get paid five francs. So if you say I had two tails throws, you get paid 10 francs.
If you say you had zero, you get paid zero francs.
If you say, "I had four tails throws," then you get paid 20 francs.
It's anonymous, nobody's watching what you're doing, and you get paid that money anonymously.
I've got two questions for you.
(Laughter) You know what's coming now, right?
First, how would you behave in that situation?
The second, look to your left and look to your right -- (Laughter) and think about how the person sitting next to you might behave in that situation.
We did this experiment for real.
We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition that took place here in Zurich recently, not with students in the lab at the university but with the real population, like you guys.
First, a quick reminder of stats.
If I throw the coin four times and it's a fair coin, then the probability that it comes up four times tails is 6.25 percent.
And I hope you can intuitively see that the probability that all four of them are tails is much lower than if two of them are tails, right?
Here are the specific numbers. Here's what happened.
People did this experiment for real.
Around 30 to 35 percent of people said, "Well, I had four tails throws.
" That's extremely unlikely.
You leave 20 francs on the table by announcing zero.
I don't know whether the other people all were honest or whether they also said a little bit higher or lower than what they did because it's anonymous.
We only observed the distribution.
But what I can tell you -- and here's another coin toss. There you go, it's tails. (Laughter) Don't check, OK?
(Laughter) What I can tell you is that not everybody behaved like Adam Smith would have predicted. So what does that leave us with?
Well, it seems people are motivated by certain intrinsic values and in our research, we look at this.
We look at the idea that people have so-called protected values.
A protected value isn't just any value.
A protected value is a value where you're willing to pay a price to uphold that value.
You're willing to pay a price to withstand the temptation to give in.
And the consequence is you feel better if you earn money in a way that's consistent with your values.
Let me show you this again in the metaphor of our beloved dog here.
If we succeed in getting the sausage without violating our values, then the sausage tastes better.
That's what our research shows.
If, on the other hand, we do so -- if we get the sausage and in doing so we actually violate values, we value the sausage less.
Quantitatively, that's quite powerful.
We can measure these protected values, for example, by a survey measure.
If you think about the average of the population and then there's a distribution around it -- people are different, we all are different.
People who have a set of protected values that's one standard deviation above the average, they discount money they receive by lying by about 25 percent.
That means a dollar received when lying is worth to them only 75 cents without any incentives you put in place for them to behave honestly.
It's their intrinsic motivation.
By the way, I'm not a moral authority. I'm not saying I have all these beautiful values, right?
But I'm interested in how people behave and how we can leverage that richness in human nature to actually improve the workings of our organizations.
So there are two very, very different visions here.
On the one hand, you can appeal to benefits and costs and try to get people to behave according to them.
On the other hand, you can select people who have the values and the desirable characteristics, of course -- competencies that go in line with your organization.
I do not yet know where these protected values really come from.
Is it nurture or is it nature?
What I can tell you is that the distribution looks pretty similar for men and women.
It looks pretty similar for those who had studied economics or those who had studied psychology.
It looks even pretty similar around different age categories among adults.
But I don't know yet how this develops over a lifetime.
That will be the subject of future research.
The idea I want to leave you with is it's all right to appeal to incentives.
I'm an economist; I certainly believe in the fact that incentives work.
But do think about selecting the right people rather than having people and then putting incentives in place.
Selecting the right people with the right values may go a long way to saving a lot of trouble and a lot of money in your organizations.
In other words, it will pay off to put people first.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I used to think the whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness.
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled, I felt anxious and adrift.
And I wasn't alone; my friends -- they struggled with this, too.
Even though life is getting objectively better by nearly every conceivable standard, more people feel hopeless, depressed and alone.
There's an emptiness gnawing away at people, and you don't have to be clinically depressed to feel it.
And according to the research, what predicts this despair is not a lack of happiness.
It's a lack of something else, a lack of having meaning in life.
Is there more to life than being happy?
Many psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease, feeling good in the moment.
Meaning, though, is deeper.
The renowned psychologist Martin Seligman says meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you.
To find out, I spent five years interviewing hundreds of people and reading through thousands of pages of psychology, neuroscience and philosophy. Bringing it all together, I found that there are what I call four pillars of a meaningful life.
Belonging comes from being in relationships where you're valued for who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well.
But some groups and relationships deliver a cheap form of belonging; you're valued for what you believe, for who you hate, not for who you are.
But one time, Jonathan didn't have the right change, and the vendor said, "Don't worry about it.
He was trying to do something kind, but Jonathan had rejected him.
These acts devalue others.
Your life isn't just a list of events. You can edit, interpret and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts.
" People who tell stories like this -- "My life was good.
The psychologist Dan McAdams calls this a "redemptive story," where the bad is redeemed by the good.
But what makes people change their stories?
Some people get help from a therapist, but you can do it on your own, too, just by reflecting on your life thoughtfully, how your defining experiences shaped you, what you lost, what you gained.
That's what Emeka did.
After all, we've all suffered, and we all struggle.
But embracing those painful memories can lead to new insights and wisdom, to finding that good that sustains you.
Belonging, purpose, transcendence, storytelling: those are the four pillars of meaning.
My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse from our home in Montreal.
But it gave them a purpose: to rein in the ego.
And sometimes we can get off track.
Whenever that happens to me, I remember a powerful experience I had with my father.
Several months after I graduated from college, my dad had a massive heart attack that should have killed him.
He wanted our names to be the last words he spoke on earth if he died.
(Applause)I used to think the whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness.
Everyone said the path to happiness was success, so I searched for that ideal job, that perfect boyfriend, that beautiful apartment.
And I wasn't alone; my friends -- they struggled with this, too.
And what really struck me was this: the suicide rate has been rising around the world, and it recently reached a 30-year high in America.
But that raised some questions for me.
Is there more to life than being happy?
And what's the difference between being happy and having meaning in life?
Many psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease, feeling good in the moment.
Meaning, though, is deeper.
The renowned psychologist Martin Seligman says meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you.
Our culture is obsessed with happiness, but I came to see that seeking meaning is the more fulfilling path.
And the studies show that people who have meaning in life, they're more resilient, they do better in school and at work, and they even live longer.
So this all made me wonder: How can we each live more meaningfully?
To find out, I spent five years interviewing hundreds of people and reading through thousands of pages of psychology, neuroscience and philosophy. Bringing it all together, I found that there are what I call four pillars of a meaningful life.
And we can each create lives of meaning by building some or all of these pillars in our lives.
The first pillar is belonging.
Belonging comes from being in relationships where you're valued for who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well.
But some groups and relationships deliver a cheap form of belonging; you're valued for what you believe, for who you hate, not for who you are.
True belonging springs from love.
It lives in moments among individuals, and it's a choice -- you can choose to cultivate belonging with others.
Here's an example. Each morning, my friend Jonathan buys a newspaper from the same street vendor in New York.
They don't just conduct a transaction, though.
They take a moment to slow down, talk, and treat each other like humans.
But one time, Jonathan didn't have the right change, and the vendor said, "Don't worry about it.
" But Jonathan insisted on paying, so he went to the store and bought something he didn't need to make change.
But when he gave the money to the vendor, the vendor drew back.
He was hurt.
He was trying to do something kind, but Jonathan had rejected him.
I think we all reject people in small ways like this without realizing it.
I do.
I'll walk by someone I know and barely acknowledge them.
I'll check my phone when someone's talking to me.
These acts devalue others.
They make them feel invisible and unworthy.
But when you lead with love, you create a bond that lifts each of you up.
For many people, belonging is the most essential source of meaning, those bonds to family and friends.
For others, the key to meaning is the second pillar: purpose. Now, finding your purpose is not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy.
Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give. A hospital custodian told me her purpose is healing sick people.
Many parents tell me, "My purpose is raising my children.
" The key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others.
Of course, for many of us, that happens through work.
That's how we contribute and feel needed.
But that also means that issues like disengagement at work, unemployment, low labor force participation -- these aren't just economic problems, they're existential ones, too.
Without something worthwhile to do, people flounder.
Of course, you don't have to find purpose at work, but purpose gives you something to live for, some "why" that drives you forward. The third pillar of meaning is also about stepping beyond yourself, but in a completely different way: transcendence.
Transcendent states are those rare moments when you're lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life, your sense of self fades away, and you feel connected to a higher reality.
For one person I talked to, transcendence came from seeing art. For another person, it was at church.
For me, I'm a writer, and it happens through writing.
Sometimes I get so in the zone that I lose all sense of time and place.
These transcendent experiences can change you.
One study had students look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees for one minute.
But afterwards they felt less self-centered, and they even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone.
Belonging, purpose, transcendence. Now, the fourth pillar of meaning, I've found, tends to surprise people. The fourth pillar is storytelling, the story you tell yourself about yourself.
Creating a narrative from the events of your life brings clarity.
It helps you understand how you became you.
But we don't always realize that we're the authors of our stories and can change the way we're telling them.
Your life isn't just a list of events. You can edit, interpret and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts.
I met a young man named Emeka, who'd been paralyzed playing football.
After his injury, Emeka told himself, "My life was great playing football, but now look at me.
" People who tell stories like this -- "My life was good.
Now it's bad.
" -- tend to be more anxious and depressed. And that was Emeka for a while.
But with time, he started to weave a different story.
His new story was, "Before my injury, my life was purposeless.
I partied a lot and was a pretty selfish guy.
But my injury made me realize I could be a better man.
" That edit to his story changed Emeka's life.
After telling the new story to himself, Emeka started mentoring kids, and he discovered what his purpose was: serving others.
The psychologist Dan McAdams calls this a "redemptive story," where the bad is redeemed by the good.
People leading meaningful lives, he's found, tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption, growth and love.
But what makes people change their stories?
Some people get help from a therapist, but you can do it on your own, too, just by reflecting on your life thoughtfully, how your defining experiences shaped you, what you lost, what you gained.
That's what Emeka did.
You won't change your story overnight; it could take years and be painful.
After all, we've all suffered, and we all struggle.
But embracing those painful memories can lead to new insights and wisdom, to finding that good that sustains you.
Belonging, purpose, transcendence, storytelling: those are the four pillars of meaning.
When I was younger, I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all of the pillars.
My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse from our home in Montreal.
Sufism is a spiritual practice associated with the whirling dervishes and the poet Rumi.
Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home to meditate, drink Persian tea, and share stories.
Their practice also involved serving all of creation through small acts of love, which meant being kind even when people wronged you.
But it gave them a purpose: to rein in the ego.
Eventually, I left home for college and without the daily grounding of Sufism in my life, I felt unmoored.
And I started searching for those things that make life worth living.
That's what set me on this journey.
Looking back, I now realize that the Sufi house had a real culture of meaning.
The pillars were part of the architecture, and the presence of the pillars helped us all live more deeply.
Of course, the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones.
Gangs, cults: these are cultures of meaning that use the pillars and give people something to live and die for.
But that's exactly why we as a society must offer better alternatives.
We need to build these pillars within our families and our institutions to help people become their best selves.
But living a meaningful life takes work.
It's an ongoing process.
As each day goes by, we're constantly creating our lives, adding to our story.
And sometimes we can get off track.
Whenever that happens to me, I remember a powerful experience I had with my father.
Several months after I graduated from college, my dad had a massive heart attack that should have killed him.
He survived, and when I asked him what was going through his mind as he faced death, he said all he could think about was needing to live so he could be there for my brother and me, and this gave him the will to fight for life.
When he went under anesthesia for emergency surgery, instead of counting backwards from 10, he repeated our names like a mantra.
He wanted our names to be the last words he spoke on earth if he died.
My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi. It's a humble life, but a good life.
Lying there facing death, he had a reason to live: love.
His sense of belonging within his family, his purpose as a dad, his transcendent meditation, repeating our names -- these, he says, are the reasons why he survived.
That's the story he tells himself.
That's the power of meaning. Happiness comes and goes. But when life is really good and when things are really bad, having meaning gives you something to hold on to.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is a talk about sugar and cancer. I became interested in sugar when I was in college.
Not this kind of sugar. It was the sugar that our biology professors taught us about in the context of the coating of your cells.
Maybe you didn't know that your cells are coated with sugar.
And I didn't know that, either, until I took these courses in college, but back then -- and this was in, let's just call it the 1980s -- people didn't know much about why our cells are coated with sugar.
And when I dug through my notes, what I noticed I had written down is that the sugar coating on our cells is like the sugar coating on a peanut M and M.
And people thought the sugar coating on our cells was like a protective coating that somehow made our cells stronger or tougher.
But we now know, many decades later, that it's much more complicated than that, and that the sugars on our cells are actually very complex.
And if you could shrink yourself down to a little miniature airplane and fly right along the surface of your cells, it might look something like this -- with geographical features.
And now, the complex sugars are these trees and bushes -- weeping willows that are swaying in the wind and moving with the waves.
And when I started thinking about all these complex sugars that are like this foliage on our cells, it became one of the most interesting problems that I encountered as a biologist and also as a chemist.
And so now we tend to think about the sugars that are populating the surface of our cells as a language.
But what are they trying to tell us?
I can tell you that we do know some information that comes from these sugars, and it's turned out already to be incredibly important in the world of medicine.
For example, one thing your sugars are telling us is your blood type.
Put your hands up.
(Laughter) But for those of you who share the blood type O with me, what this means is that we have this chemical structure on the surface of our blood cells: three simple sugars linked together to make a more complex sugar.
And that, by definition, is blood type O. Now, how many people are blood type A?
What else are the sugars on the surface of your cells trying to tell us?
So a few decades ago, correlations began to emerge from the analysis of tumor tissue.
And those correlations have come up again and again and again.
Why do cancers have different sugars?
So, one of the changes that we study is an increase in the density of a particular sugar that's called sialic acid.
It's actually quite common on your cells.
And this is something that's, I think, in the news a lot these days.
So we know that.
" But he was treated with one of these new immune-stimulating drugs, and now his melanoma appears to be in remission, which is remarkable, considering the situation only a few years ago.
And there's a protein on immune cells that grabs the sialic acid, and if that protein gets held at that synapse between the immune cell and the cancer cell, it puts that immune cell to sleep.
Look somewhere else.
And what if you could strip off that coat and take that sugar away?
We're developing new medicines that are basically cell-surface lawnmowers -- molecules that go down to the surface of these cancer cells and just cut off those sialic acids, so that the immune system can reach its full potential in eliminating those cancer cells from our body.
The sugars are telling cells around that cell whether the cell is good or bad.
" Thank you.
" Well honestly, I felt a little uncomfortable hearing that from someone I didn't know very well; it felt sort of intimate.
(Laughter) So we headed south, to enjoy the sun and to see what would happen when the sun briefly went away.
Then I looked offshore, and I noticed running lights on boats, so clearly it was getting dark, although I hadn't realized it.
Now, consider that, at this point, I was in my mid-30s.
But here was a sky I had never seen.
First, there were the colors.
Up above, it was a deep purple-grey, like twilight.
But on the horizon it was orange, like sunset, 360 degrees.
And up above, in the twilight, bright stars and planets had come out.
So there was Jupiter and there was Mercury and there was Venus.
They were all in a line.
And there, along this line, was this thing, this glorious, bewildering thing.
It looked like a wreath woven from silvery thread, and it just hung out there in space, shimmering.
That was the sun's outer atmosphere, the solar corona.
And pictures just don't do it justice.
It's not just a ring or halo around the sun; it's finely textured, like it's made out of strands of silk.
And although it looked nothing like our sun, of course, I knew that's what it was.
So there was the sun, and there were the planets, and I could see how the planets revolve around the sun.
It's like I had left our solar system and was standing on some alien world, looking back at creation.
And for the first time in my life, I just felt viscerally connected to the universe in all of its immensity.
Time stopped, or it just kind of felt nonexistent, and what I beheld with my eyes -- I didn't just see it, it felt like a vision.
And I stood there in this nirvana for all of 174 seconds -- less than three minutes -- when all of a sudden, it was over.
The sun burst out, the blue sky returned, the stars and the planets and the corona were gone.
The world returned to normal.
But I had changed.
And that's how I became an umbraphile -- an eclipse chaser.
(Laughter) So, this is how I spend my time and hard-earned money.
Every couple of years, I head off to wherever the moon's shadow will fall to experience another couple minutes of cosmic bliss, and to share the experience with others: with friends in Australia, with an entire city in Germany.
In 1999, in Munich, I joined hundreds of thousands who filled the streets and the rooftops and cheered in unison as the solar corona emerged.
And over time, I've become something else: an eclipse evangelist.
I see it as my job to pay forward the advice that I received all those years ago.
And so let me tell you: before you die, you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse.
It is the ultimate experience of awe.
Now, that word, "awesome," has grown so overused that it's lost its original meaning.
True awe, a sense of wonder and insignificance in the face of something enormous and grand, is rare in our lives.
But when you experience it, it's powerful.
Awe dissolves the ego.
It makes us feel connected.
Indeed, it promotes empathy and generosity.
Well, there is nothing truly more awesome than a total solar eclipse.
Unfortunately, few Americans have seen one, because it's been 38 years since one last touched the continental United States and 99 years since one last crossed the breadth of the nation.
But that is about to change.
Over the next 35 years, five total solar eclipses will visit the continental United States, and three of them will be especially grand.
Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 -- (Applause) the moon's shadow will race from Oregon to South Carolina.
April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow heads north from Texas to Maine.
In 2045, on August 12, the path cuts from California to Florida.
I say: What if we made these holidays?
What if we -- (Laughter) (Applause) What if we all stood together, as many people as possible, in the shadow of the moon? Just maybe, this shared experience of awe would help heal our divisions, get us to treat each other just a bit more humanely.
Now, admittedly, some folks consider my evangelizing a little out there; my obsession, eccentric.
I mean, why focus so much attention on something so brief?
Why cross the globe -- or state lines, for that matter -- for something that lasts three minutes?
As I said: I am not a spiritual person.
I don't believe in God.
I wish I did.
But when I think of my own mortality -- and I do, a lot -- when I think of everyone I have lost, my mother in particular, what soothes me is that moment of awe I had in Aruba.
I picture myself on that beach, looking at that sky, and I remember how I felt.
My existence may be temporary, but that's OK because, my gosh, look at what I'm a part of.
And so this is a lesson I've learned, and it's one that applies to life in general: duration of experience does not equal impact.
One weekend, one conversation -- hell, one glance -- can change everything.
Cherish those moments of deep connection with other people, with the natural world, and make them a priority.
Yes, I chase eclipses.
You might chase something else.
But it's not about the 174 seconds.
It's about how they change the years that come after.
Thank you.
(Applause)Before I get to bulk of what I have to say, I feel compelled just to mention a couple of things about myself.
I am not some mystical, spiritual sort of person.
I'm a science writer.
I studied physics in college.
I used to be a science correspondent for NPR.
OK, that said: in the course of working on a story for NPR, I got some advice from an astronomer that challenged my outlook, and frankly, changed my life.
In a total eclipse, for all of two or three minutes, the moon completely blocks the face of the sun, creating what he described as the most awe-inspiring spectacle in all of nature.
And so the advice he gave me was this: "Before you die," he said, "you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse.
" Well honestly, I felt a little uncomfortable hearing that from someone I didn't know very well; it felt sort of intimate.
But it got my attention, and so I did some research.
Now the thing about total eclipses is, if you wait for one to come to you, you're going to be waiting a long time.
Any given point on earth experiences a total eclipse about once every 400 years.
But if you're willing to travel, you don't have to wait that long.
And so I learned that a few years later, in 1998, a total eclipse was going to cross the Caribbean.
Now, a total eclipse is visible only along a narrow path, about a hundred miles wide, and that's where the moon's shadow falls.
It's called the "path of totality.
" And in February 1998, the path of totality was going to cross Aruba.
So I talked to my husband, and we thought: February?
Aruba?
Sounded like a good idea anyway.
(Laughter) So we headed south, to enjoy the sun and to see what would happen when the sun briefly went away.
Well, the day of the eclipse found us and many other people out behind the Hyatt Regency, on the beach, waiting for the show to begin.
And we wore eclipse glasses with cardboard frames and really dark lenses that enabled us to look at the sun safely.
A total eclipse begins as a partial eclipse, as the moon very slowly makes its way in front of the sun.
So first it looked the sun had a little notch in its edge, and then that notch grew larger and larger, turning the sun into a crescent.
And it was all very interesting, but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.
Well, about 10 minutes before the total solar eclipse was set to begin, weird things started to happen.
A cool wind kicked up.
Daylight looked odd, and shadows became very strange; they looked bizarrely sharp, as if someone had turned up the contrast knob on the TV.
Then I looked offshore, and I noticed running lights on boats, so clearly it was getting dark, although I hadn't realized it.
Well soon, it was obvious it was getting dark.
It felt like my eyesight was failing.
And then all of a sudden, the lights went out.
Well, at that, a cheer erupted from the beach, and I took off my eclipse glasses, because at this point during the total eclipse, it was safe to look at the sun with the naked eye.
And I glanced upward, and I was just dumbstruck.
Now, consider that, at this point, I was in my mid-30s.
I had lived on earth long enough to know what the sky looks like.
I mean -- (Laughter) I'd seen blue skies and grey skies and starry skies and angry skies and pink skies at sunrise.
But here was a sky I had never seen.
First, there were the colors.
Up above, it was a deep purple-grey, like twilight.
But on the horizon it was orange, like sunset, 360 degrees.
And up above, in the twilight, bright stars and planets had come out.
So there was Jupiter and there was Mercury and there was Venus.

(Applause)
What's one thing that every person in this room is going to become? Older. And most of us are scared stiff at the prospect.
How does that word make you feel?
I used to feel the same way.
What was I most worried about?
Ending up drooling in some grim institutional hallway.
And then I learned that only four percent of older Americans are living in nursing homes, and the percentage is dropping.
What else was I worried about? Dementia. Turns out that most of us can think just fine to the end.
Dementia rates are dropping, too.
The real epidemic is anxiety over memory loss. (Laughter) I also figured that old people were depressed because they were old and they were going to die soon.
(Laughter) It turns out that the longer people live, the less they fear dying, and that people are happiest at the beginnings and the end of their lives.
It's called the U-curve of happiness, and it's been borne out by dozens of studies around the world.
You don't have to be a Buddhist or a billionaire.
The curve is a function of the way aging itself affects the brain.
So I started feeling a lot better about getting older, and I started obsessing about why so few people know these things.
The reason is ageism: discrimination and stereotyping on the basis of age.
We experience it anytime someone assumes we're too old for something, instead of finding out who we are and what we're capable of, or too young.
Ageism cuts both ways.
All -isms are socially constructed ideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia -- and that means we make them up, and they can change over time.
All these prejudices pit us against each other to maintain the status quo, like auto workers in the US competing against auto workers in Mexico instead of organizing for better wages.
(Applause) We know it's not OK to allocate resources by race or by sex.
Why should it be OK to weigh the needs of the young against the old?
All prejudice relies on "othering" -- seeing a group of people as other than ourselves: other race, other religion, other nationality.
The strange thing about ageism: that other is us.
Ageism feeds on denial -- our reluctance to acknowledge that we are going to become that older person.
It's denial when we try to pass for younger or when we believe in anti-aging products, or when we feel like our bodies are betraying us, simply because they are changing.
Why on earth do we stop celebrating the ability to adapt and grow as we move through life?
Why should aging well mean struggling to look and move like younger versions of ourselves?
It's embarrassing to be called out as older until we quit being embarrassed about it, and it's not healthy to go through life dreading our futures.
The sooner we get off this hamster wheel of age denial, the better off we are.
Right?
And yet, we tend to think of everyone in a retirement home as the same age: old -- (Laughter) when they can span four decades.
Can you imagine thinking that way about a group of people between the ages of 20 and 60? When you get to a party, do you head for people your own age?
Have you ever grumbled about entitled millennials?
Have you ever rejected a haircut or a relationship or an outing because it's not age-appropriate?
For adults, there's no such thing.
All these behaviors are ageist.
We all do them, and we can't challenge bias unless we're aware of it.
Old people are pathetic.
Look at Hollywood. A survey of recent Best Picture nominations found that only 12 percent of speaking or named characters were age 60 and up, and many of them were portrayed as impaired.
It's homophobia.
Aging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured.
There is no line in the sand between old and young, after which it's all downhill.
When we talk to older people like this (Speaks more loudly) or call them "sweetie" or "young lady" -- it's called elderspeak -- they appear to instantly age, walking and talking less competently.
Almost two-thirds of people over 60 around the world say they have trouble accessing healthcare.
Almost three-quarters say their income doesn't cover basic services like food, water, electricity, and decent housing.
Here's the thing: we don't have to choose.
Longevity is here to stay. A movement to end ageism is underway.
Ending up drooling in some grim institutional hallway.
Why on earth do we stop celebrating the ability to adapt and grow as we move through life?
Why should aging well mean struggling to look and move like younger versions of ourselves?
It's embarrassing to be called out as older until we quit being embarrassed about it, and it's not healthy to go through life dreading our futures.
The sooner we get off this hamster wheel of age denial, the better off we are.
Stereotypes are always a mistake, of course, but especially when it comes to age, because the longer we live, the more different from one another we become.
Right?
Think about it.
And yet, we tend to think of everyone in a retirement home as the same age: old -- (Laughter) when they can span four decades.
Can you imagine thinking that way about a group of people between the ages of 20 and 60? When you get to a party, do you head for people your own age?

For adults, there's no such thing.
All these behaviors are ageist.
We all do them, and we can't challenge bias unless we're aware of it.
Nobody's born ageist, but it starts at early childhood, around the same time attitudes towards race and gender start to form, because negative messages about late life bombard us from the media and popular culture at every turn.
Right?
Wrinkles are ugly.
Old people are pathetic.
It's sad to be old.
Look at Hollywood. A survey of recent Best Picture nominations found that only 12 percent of speaking or named characters were age 60 and up, and many of them were portrayed as impaired.
" (Laughter) I stopped blaming my sore knee on being 64. My other knee doesn't hurt, and it's just as old.
(Laughter) (Applause) We are all worried about some aspect of getting older, whether running out of money, getting sick, ending up alone, and those fears are legitimate and real.
But what never dawns on most of us is that the experience of reaching old age can be better or worse depending on the culture in which it takes place.
It is not having a vagina that makes life harder for women.
It's sexism. (Applause) It's not loving a man that makes life harder for gay guys.
It's homophobia.
And it is not the passage of time that makes getting older so much harder than it has to be.
It is ageism.
When labels are hard to read or there's no handrail or we can't open the damn jar, we blame ourselves, our failure to age successfully, instead of the ageism that makes those natural transitions shameful and the discrimination that makes those barriers acceptable.
You can't make money off satisfaction, but shame and fear create markets, and capitalism always needs new markets.
Who says wrinkles are ugly?
The multi-billion-dollar skin care industry.
Who says perimenopause and low T and mild cognitive impairment are medical conditions?
The trillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry.
(Cheers) The more clearly we see these forces at work, the easier it is to come up with alternative, more positive and more accurate narratives.
Aging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured.
It is a natural, powerful, lifelong process that unites us all.
Changing the culture is a tall order, I know that, but culture is fluid.
Look at how much the position of women has changed in my lifetime or the incredible strides that the gay rights movement has made in just a few decades, right?
(Applause) Look at gender. We used to think of it as a binary, male or female, and now we understand it's a spectrum.
It is high time to ditch the old-young binary, too.
There is no line in the sand between old and young, after which it's all downhill.
And the longer we wait to challenge that idea, the more damage it does to ourselves and our place in the world, like in the workforce, where age discrimination is rampant.
In Silicon Valley, engineers are getting Botoxed and hair-plugged before key interviews -- and these are skilled white men in their 30s, so imagine the effects further down the food chain.
(Laughter) The personal and economic consequences are devastating.
Not one stereotype about older workers holds up under scrutiny.
Companies aren't adaptable and creative because their employees are young; they're adaptable and creative despite it.
Companies -- (Laughter) (Applause) We know that diverse companies aren't just better places to work; they work better.
And just like race and sex, age is a criterion for diversity.
A growing body of fascinating research shows that attitudes towards aging affect how our minds and bodies function at the cellular level.
When we talk to older people like this (Speaks more loudly) or call them "sweetie" or "young lady" -- it's called elderspeak -- they appear to instantly age, walking and talking less competently.
People with more positive feelings towards aging walk faster, they do better on memory tests, they heal quicker, and they live longer.
Even with brains full of plaques and tangles, some people stayed sharp to the end.
What did they have in common?
A sense of purpose.
And what's the biggest obstacle to having a sense of purpose in late life?
A culture that tells us that getting older means shuffling offstage.
That's why the World Health Organization is developing a global anti-ageism initiative to extend not just life span but health span.
Women experience the double whammy of ageism and sexism, so we experience aging differently.
There's a double standard at work here -- shocker -- (Laughter) the notion that aging enhances men and devalues women. Women reinforce this double standard when we compete to stay young, another punishing and losing proposition.
Does any woman in this room really believe that she is a lesser version -- less interesting, less fun in bed, less valuable -- than the woman she once was?
This discrimination affects our health, our well-being and our income, and the effects add up over time.
They are further compounded by race and by class, which is why, everywhere in the world, the poorest of the poor are old women of color.
What's the takeaway from that map?
By 2050, one out of five of us, almost two billion people, will be age 60 and up.
Longevity is a fundamental hallmark of human progress.
All these older people represent a vast unprecedented and untapped market.
And yet, capitalism and urbanization have propelled age bias into every corner of the globe, from Switzerland, where elders fare the best, to Afghanistan, which sits at the bottom of the Global AgeWatch Index.
Half of the world's countries aren't mentioned on that list because we don't bother to collect data on millions of people because they're no longer young.
Almost two-thirds of people over 60 around the world say they have trouble accessing healthcare.
Almost three-quarters say their income doesn't cover basic services like food, water, electricity, and decent housing.
Is this the world we want our children, who may well live to be a hundred, to inherit?
Everyone -- all ages, all genders, all nationalities -- is old or future-old, and unless we put an end to it, ageism will oppress us all.
And that makes it a perfect target for collective advocacy.
Why add another -ism to the list when so many, racism in particular, call out for action?
Here's the thing: we don't have to choose.
Longevity is here to stay. A movement to end ageism is underway.
I'm in it, and I hope you will join me.
(Applause and cheers) Thank you.
Let's do it! Let's do it!
(Applause)
So let's just see what Darknet thinks of this image that we have. When we run our classifier on this image, we see we don't just get a prediction of dog or cat, we actually get specific breed predictions. That's the level of granularity we have now. And it's correct.
We need something more powerful.
I work on a problem called object detection, where we look at an image and try to find all of the objects, put bounding boxes around them and say what those objects are. So here's what happens when we run a detector on this image.
This is our detection system running in real time on my laptop.So it smoothly tracks me as I move around the frame, and it's robust to a wide variety of changes in size, pose, forward, backward.This is great.
This is what we really need if we're going to build systems on top of computer vision. (Applause) So in just a few years, we've gone from 20 seconds per image to 20 milliseconds per image, a thousand times faster.
How did we get there?
Let's just zoom in a little bit. And this is great. And all of the processing is happening in real time on the laptop. And it's important to remember that this is a general purpose object detection system, so we can train this for any image domain.
So let's just see what Darknet thinks of this image that we have. When we run our classifier on this image, we see we don't just get a prediction of dog or cat, we actually get specific breed predictions. That's the level of granularity we have now. And it's correct.
We need something more powerful.
I work on a problem called object detection, where we look at an image and try to find all of the objects, put bounding boxes around them and say what those objects are. So here's what happens when we run a detector on this image.
This is what we really need if we're going to build systems on top of computer vision. (Applause) So in just a few years, we've gone from 20 seconds per image to 20 milliseconds per image, a thousand times faster.
I was studying these corals for my PhD, and after days and days of diving on the same reef, I had gotten to know them as individuals.
I had made friends with coral colonies -- totally a normal thing to do.
Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart and ripped off their skin, leaving little bits of wounded tissue that would have a hard time healing, and big patches of dead skeleton that would get overgrown by algae.
If a coral could die that fast, how could a reef ever survive?
Like its cousins that bleach, it's fighting back the algae. And like its cousins on the north shore, it's aiming to live for 1,000 years.
I was studying these corals for my PhD, and after days and days of diving on the same reef, I had gotten to know them as individuals.
Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart and ripped off their skin, leaving little bits of wounded tissue that would have a hard time healing, and big patches of dead skeleton that would get overgrown by algae.
When I saw this damage for the first time, stretching all the way down the reef, I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear and I cried.
And why was I making it my job to try to fight for them?
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now.
Coming round from anesthesia is very different.
It was total oblivion.
How does consciousness happen?
Do they also have a sense of self?
Consciousness and intelligence are very different things.
You don't have to be smart to suffer, but you probably do have to be alive.
Now, you might have heard that we know nothing about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness.
Let's start with experiences of the world around us, and with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine.
Have a listen to this.
(Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right?
Have a listen again and see if you can get anything.
(Distorted voice) Still strange.
Now listen to this.
(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit is a really terrible idea.
(Laughter) Which I do.
So you heard some words there, right?
Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it.
(Distorted voice) Yeah?
So you can now hear words there.
Once more for luck.
(Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here?
The remarkable thing is the sensory information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all.
All that's changed is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information.
And that changes what you consciously hear.
All this puts the brain basis of perception in a bit of a different light.
Instead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions flowing in the opposite direction.
We don't just passively perceive the world, we actively generate it.
The world we experience comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in.
Let me give you one more example of perception as this active, constructive process.
Here we've combined immersive virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience.
In this panoramic video, we've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground.
We've processed the footage using an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions.
In this case, to see dogs.
And you can see this is a very strange thing.
When perceptual predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis.
Now, think about this for a minute.
It's just that when we agree about our hallucinations, we call that reality.
(Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain.
This seems a very strange idea, right?
Yes, visual illusions might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived about what it means to be me?
For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified and so continuous that it's difficult not to take it for granted.
But we shouldn't take it for granted.
There are in fact many different ways we experience being a self.
There's the experience of having a body and of being a body.
There are experiences of perceiving the world from a first person point of view.
There are experiences of intending to do things and of being the cause of things that happen in the world.
And there are experiences of being a continuous and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set of memories and social interactions.
Many experiments show, and psychiatrists and neurologists know very well, that these different ways in which we experience being a self can all come apart.
What this means is the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain.
Another experience, which just like all others, requires explanation.
So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate the experience of being a body and of having a body?
Well, just the same principles apply.
The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not part of its body.
And there's a beautiful experiment in neuroscience to illustrate this.
And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home.
All you need is one of these.
In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand is placed in front of them.
Then both hands are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand.
Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand is in fact part of their body.
And the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess that the fake hand is in fact part of the body.
(Laughter) So you can measure all kinds of clever things.
You can measure skin conductance and startle responses, but there's no need.
It's clear the guy in blue has assimilated the fake hand.
We don't just experience our bodies as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within.
We all experience the sense of being a body from the inside.
And sensory signals coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing, what the blood pressure is like, lots of things.
This kind of perception, which we call interoception, is rather overlooked.
This is from our lab at Sussex.
And here, people see a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time with their heartbeat.
And when it's flashing in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense that it's in fact part of their body.
So experiences of having a body are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within.
There's one last thing I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us.
When I look around me, the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it as an object from the outside.
But my experiences of the body from within, they're not like that at all.
I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen . . . I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere.
I don't perceive my insides as objects.
In fact, I don't experience them much at all unless they go wrong.
And this is important, I think.
Perception of the internal state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival.
When the brain uses predictions to figure out what's there, we perceive objects as the causes of sensations.
When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things, we experience how well or how badly that control is going.
So our most basic experiences of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
And when we follow this idea all the way through, we can start to see that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic drive to stay alive.
We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of our living bodies.
Let me bring things together step-by-step.
What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess of what's out there.
Our experienced world comes from the inside out, not just the outside in.
The rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body.
And these self-related predictions depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body.
And finally, experiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there.
So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity.
We predict ourselves into existence.
Now, I leave you with three implications of all this.
First, just as we can misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms of prediction go wrong.
Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like depression and schizophrenia.
Second: what it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated.
We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
Just making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient.
Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible way of being conscious.
And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses.
Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures.
Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science, from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day.
With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of and not apart from the rest of nature.
And . . . when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Nothing at all.
Thank you.Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life, I ceased to exist.
I was having a small operation, and my brain was filling with anesthetic.
I remember a sense of detachment and falling apart and a coldness.
And then I was back, drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there.
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now.
Coming round from anesthesia is very different.
I could have been under for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years.
I simply wasn't there.
It was total oblivion.
Anesthesia -- it's a modern kind of magic.
It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people.
And in this process is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy.
How does consciousness happen?
Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience.
And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience right here and right now.
How does this happen?
Answering this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is.
Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all.
And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through mental illness or pain.
And if we can experience joy and suffering, what about other animals?
Might they be conscious, too?
Do they also have a sense of self?
And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point, maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops a sense of its own existence.
I actually think the prospects for a conscious AI are pretty remote.
And I think this because my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms.
Consciousness and intelligence are very different things.
You don't have to be smart to suffer, but you probably do have to be alive.
In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through and because of our living bodies.
Now, you might have heard that we know nothing about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness.
Some people even say it's beyond the reach of science altogether.
But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area.
If you come to my lab at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers.
All of us together trying to understand how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong.
And the strategy is very simple.
I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've come to think about life.
At one time, people thought the property of being alive could not be explained by physics and chemistry -- that life had to be more than just mechanism.
But people no longer think that.
So as with life, so with consciousness.
Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is should start to fade away.
At least that's the plan.
So let's get started.
What are the properties of consciousness?
What should a science of consciousness try to explain?
Well, for today I'd just like to think of consciousness in two different ways.
There are experiences of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic, 3D, fully immersive inner movie.
And then there's conscious self.
The specific experience of being you or being me.
The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness we all cling to most tightly.
Let's start with experiences of the world around us, and with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine.
Imagine being a brain.
You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure what's out there in the world.
There's no lights inside the skull. There's no sound either.
All you've got to go on is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related to things in the world, whatever they may be.
So perception -- figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs about the way the world is to form its best guess of what caused those signals.
The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.
What we perceive is its best guess of what's out there in the world.
Let me give you a couple of examples of all this.
You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think about it in a new way.
If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact exactly the same shade.
And I can illustrate this.
If I put up a second version of the image here and join the two patches with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference.
It's exactly the same shade of gray.
And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across and join them up.
It's a single colored block of gray, there's no difference at all.
This isn't any kind of magic trick.
It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again, and it looks different.
So what's happening here is that the brain is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter than it really is.
Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience.
Have a listen to this.
(Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right?
Have a listen again and see if you can get anything.
(Distorted voice) Still strange.
Now listen to this.
(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit is a really terrible idea.
(Laughter) Which I do.
So you heard some words there, right?
Now listen to the first sound again.

When perceptual predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis.
Now, think about this for a minute.
If hallucination is a kind of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions are being reined in by sensory information from the world.
In fact, we're all hallucinating all the time, including right now.
It's just that when we agree about our hallucinations, we call that reality.
(Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain.

This kind of perception, which we call interoception, is rather overlooked.
But it's critically important because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive.
Here's another version of the rubber hand illusion.

So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity.
First, just as we can misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms of prediction go wrong.
Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like depression and schizophrenia.

Nothing at all.
I remember thinking at that time: What if we could have a computer which could speak for him?Now, after years that I am in this field, I can see that this might be possible.
We are not there yet, but pay close attention. We will be there soon. Thank you.
(Applause)
I was nine years old, I loved kicking around a soccer ball, and I was a total math and science geek.
On Christmas Eve in 1989, civil war erupted in Liberia.
The war started in the rural countryside, and within months, rebel armies had marched towards our hometown.
My school shut down, and when the rebel armies captured the only international airport, people started panicking and fleeing.
I'd visit my father on weekends as a teenager to help him sell sneakers and jeans. And every time business would get bad, he'd remind me of that mantra: no condition is permanent.
The war had left us with just 51 doctors to serve a country of four million people.
So if you got sick in the city where those few doctors remain, you might stand a chance.
And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.
But nurses and doctors are concentrated in cities, so rural communities like Musu's have been left behind.
So we started asking some questions: What if we could reorganize the medical care system?
What if Musu could help us bring health care from clinics in cities to the doorsteps of her neighbors?
Later, after Prince was discharged, A. B. taught mom how to feed baby a food supplement.
I use smartphones, I use apps, I use online courses.
But when A. B. wants to learn, he's got to jump back in that canoe and get to the training center.
And when Musu shows up for training, her instructors are stuck using flip charts and markers.
Tech can truly be a game changer here.
I've been in awe of the digital education revolution that the likes of Khan Academy and edX have been leading.
And I've been thinking that it's time; it's time for a collision between the digital education revolution and the community health revolution.
And so, this brings me to my TED Prize wish.
I wish -- I wish that you would help us recruit the largest army of community health workers the world has ever known by creating the Community Health Academy, a global platform to train, connect and empower.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you.
Here's the idea: we'll create and curate the best in digital education resources.
We will bring those to community health workers around the world, including A. B. and Musu.
They'll get video lessons on giving kids vaccines and have online courses on spotting the next outbreak, so they're not stuck using flip charts.
We'll help these countries accredit these workers, so that they're not stuck remaining an under-recognized, undervalued group, but become a renowned, empowered profession, just like nurses and doctors.
And we'll create a network of companies and entrepreneurs who've created innovations that can save lives and help them connect to workers like Musu, so she can help better serve her community.
And we'll work tirelessly to persuade governments to make community health workers a cornerstone of their health care plans.
We plan to test and prototype the academy in Liberia and a few other partner countries, and then we plan to take it global, including to rural North America.
With the power of this platform, we believe countries can be more persuaded that a health care revolution really is possible.
Now, as I look out into this room, I realize that our journeys are not self-made; they're shaped by others.
And there have been so many here that have been part of this cause.
We're so honored to be part of this community, and a community that's willing to take on a cause as audacious as this one, so I wanted to offer, as I end, a reflection.
I think a lot more about what my father taught me.
These days, I too have become a dad.
I have two sons, and my wife and I just learned that she's pregnant with our third child.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) I was recently caring for a woman in Liberia who, like my wife, was in her third pregnancy.
But unlike my wife, had had no prenatal care with her first two babies.
She lived in an isolated community in the forest that had gone for 100 years without any health care until . . . until last year when a nurse trained her neighbors to become community health workers.
So here I was, seeing this patient who was in her second trimester, and I pulled out the ultrasound to check on the baby, and she started telling us stories about her first two kids, and I had the ultrasound probe on her belly, and she just stopped mid-sentence.
She turned to me and she said, "Doc, what's that sound?
" It was the first time she'd ever heard her baby's heartbeat.
And her eyes lit up in the same way my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up when we heard our baby's heartbeat.
For all of human history, illness has been universal and access to care has not.
But as a wise man once told me: no condition is permanent.
It's time.
It's time for us to go as far as it takes to change this condition together.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Why would this man say such a thing about himself?What does he mean?
How can someone view him as a hero when he sees himself as garbage?
Do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives?
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.
I mean who here likes shellfish?Or salmon?Or many other fish species whose food source in the ocean could be affected?These are cold-water corals. And did you know we actually have cold-water corals in Irish waters, just off our continental shelf?
I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya who is under the mistaken impression that this conference is named in honor of her father.
(Laughter) Who am I to contradict my baby girl?
As many of you know, there's something about becoming a parent that concentrates the mind on long-term problems like climate change.
It was the birth of my daughter that inspired me to launch this climate organization, in order to counteract the excessive polarization of this issue in the United States, and to find a conservative pathway forward.
Yes, folks, a Republican climate solution is possible, and you know what? It may even be better.
(Laughter) Let me try to prove that to you.
What we really need is a killer app to climate policy.
In the technology world, a killer app is an application so transformative that it creates its own market, like Uber.
In the climate world, a killer app is a new solution so promising that it can break through the seemingly insurmountable barriers to progress.
These include the psychological barrier.
Climate advocates have long been encouraging their fellow citizens to make short-term sacrifices now for benefits that accrue to other people in other countries 30 or 40 years in the future.
It just doesn't fly because it runs contrary to basic human nature.
Next is the geopolitical barrier.
Under the current rules of global trade, countries have a strong incentive to free ride off the emissions reductions of other nations, instead of strengthening their own programs.
This has been the curse of every international climate negotiations, including Paris.
Finally, we have the partisan barrier.
Even the most committed countries -- Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada -- are nowhere near reducing emissions at the required scale and speed.
Not even close.
And the partisan climate divide is far more acute here in the United States.
We are fundamentally stuck, and that is why we need a killer app of climate policy to break through each of these barriers.
I'm convinced that the road to climate progress in the United States runs through the Republican Party and the business community.
Together, we co-authored "The Conservative Case For Carbon Dividends.
" This represents the first time that Republican leaders put forth a concrete market-based climate solution.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) We presented our plan at the White House two weeks after President Trump moved in.
Almost every leading editorial board in the country has since endorsed our plan, and Fortune 100 companies from a wide range of industries are now getting behind it.
So by now you're probably wondering, what exactly is this plan?
Well, our carbon dividends solution is based on four pillars.
The first is a gradually rising carbon tax.
Although capitalism is a wonderful system, like many operating systems, it's prone to bugs, which, in this case, are called "market failures.
" By far the largest is that market prices fail to take social and environmental costs into account.
That means every market transaction is based on incorrect information.
This fundamental bug of capitalism, more than any other single factor, is to blame for our climate predicament.
Now in theory, this should be an easy problem to fix.
Economists agree that the best solution is to put a price on the carbon content of fossil fuels, otherwise known as a carbon tax.
This would discourage carbon emissions in every single economic transaction, every day of the year. However, a carbon tax by itself has proven to be unpopular and a political dead end.
The answer is to return all the money raised directly to citizens, in the form of equal monthly dividends.
This would transform an unpopular carbon tax into a popular and populist solution, and it would also solve the underlying psychological barrier that we discussed, by giving everyone a concrete benefit in the here and now.
And these benefits would be significant.
Assuming a carbon tax rate that starts at 40 dollars per ton, a family of four would receive 2,000 dollars per year from the get-go.
According to the US Treasury Department, the bottom 70 percent of Americans would receive more in dividends than they would pay in increased energy prices.
That means 223 million Americans would win economically from solving climate change.
And that -- (Applause) is revolutionary, and could fundamentally alter climate politics.
But there's another revolutionary element here.
The amount of the dividend would grow as the carbon tax rate increases.
The more we protect our climate, the more our citizens benefit.
This creates a positive feedback loop, which is crucial, because the only way we will reach our long-term emission-reduction goals is if the carbon tax rate goes up every year.
The third pillar of our program is eliminating regulations that are no longer needed once a carbon dividends plan is enacted.
This is a key selling point to Republicans and business leaders.
So why should we trade climate regulations for a price on carbon?
Well, let me show you.
Our plan would achieve nearly twice the emissions reductions of all Obama-era climate regulations combined, and nearly three times the new baseline after President Trump repeals all of those regulations.
That assumes a carbon tax starting at 40 dollars per ton, which translates into roughly an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.
Our plan by itself would meet the high end of America's commitment under the Paris Climate Agreement, and as you can see, the emissions reductions would continue over time.
This illustrates the power of a conservative climate solution based on free markets and limited government.
We would end up with less regulation and far less pollution at the same time, while helping working-class Americans get ahead.
Doesn't that sound like something we could all support?
(Applause) The fourth and final pillar of our program is a new climate domino effect, based on border carbon adjustments.
Now that may sound complicated, but it, too, is revolutionary, because it provides us a whole new strategy to reach a global price on carbon, which is ultimately what we need.
Let me show you an example.
Suppose Country A adopts a carbon dividends plan, and Country B does not.
Well, to level the playing field and protect the competitiveness of its industries, Country A would tax imports from Country B based on their carbon content.
Fair enough.
But here's where it gets really interesting, because the money raised at the border would increase the dividends going to the citizens of Country A.
Well, how long do you think it would take the public in Country B to realize that that money should be going to them, and to push for a carbon dividends plan in their own land?
Add a few more countries, and we get a new climate domino effect.
Once one major country or region adopts carbon dividends with border carbon adjustments, other countries are compelled to follow suit.
One by one the dominoes fall.
And this domino effect could start anywhere.
My preference, strongly, is the United States, but it could also start in the United Kingdom, in Germany or another European country, or even in China.
Let's take China as an example.
China is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but what its leaders care even more about is transitioning their economy to consumer-led economic development.
Well, nothing could do more to hasten that transition than giving every Chinese citizen a monthly dividend.
In fact, this is the only policy solution that would enable China to meet its environmental and economic goals at the same time.
That's why this is the killer app of climate policy, because it would enable us to overcome each of the barriers we discussed earlier: the psychological barrier, the partisan barrier, and, as we've just seen, the geopolitical barrier.
All we need is a country to lead the way.
And one method of finding what you're looking for is to take out an ad.
So let's read this one together.
Wanted: country to pioneer carbon dividends plan.
Cost to country: zero.
Starting date: as soon as possible.
Advantages: most effective climate solution, popular and populist, pro-growth and pro-business, shrinks government and helps the working class.
Additional compensation: gratitude of current and future generations, including my daughter.
Thank you.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Just one question for you, Ted.
I'm actually not sure I've seen a conservative get a standing O at TED before that.
That's pretty cool.
The logic seems really powerful, but some people you talk to in politics say it's hard to imagine this still getting through Congress.
How are you feeling about momentum behind this?
Ted Halstead: So I understand that many are very pessimistic about what's happening in the United States with President Trump.
I'm less pessimistic; here's why.
The actions of this White House, the early actions on climate, are just the first move in a complex game of climate chess.
So far it's been a repeal-only strategy; the pressure is going to mount for a replacement program, which is where we come in.
And there are three reasons why, which I'll go through real quickly.
One, the business community is fundamentally parting ways with the White House on climate change.
In fact, we're finding a number of Fortune 100 companies supporting our program.
Within two months, we're going to be announcing some really surprising names coming out in favor of this program.
Two, there is no issue in American politics where there's a more fundamental gap between the Republican base and the Republican leadership than climate change.
And three, thinking of this analogy of chess, the big decision up ahead is: Does the administration stay in Paris?
Well, let's pan it out both ways. If it stays in Paris, as many are pushing for in the administration, well then that begs a question: What's the plan?
We have the plan.
But if they don't stay in Paris, the international pressure will be overwhelming.
Our Secretary of State will be asking other countries for NATO contributions, and they'll be saying, "No, give us our Paris commitment.
Come through on your commitments, we'll come through on ours.
" So, international, business and even the Republican base will all be calling for a Republican replacement plan.
And, hopefully, we've provided one.
CA: Thank you so much, Ted.
TH: Thank you, Chris.
(Applause)
As patients, we usually remember the names of our doctors, but often we forget the names of our nurses.
I remember one.
I had breast cancer a few years ago, and somehow I managed to get through the surgeries and the beginning of the treatment just fine.
I could hide what was going on.
Everybody didn't really have to know.
I could walk my daughter to school, I could go out to dinner with my husband; I could fool people.
I knew what it felt like to have everybody treating me with kid gloves, and I just wanted to feel normal.
I had a port installed in my chest.
I went to my first day of chemotherapy, and I was an emotional wreck.
My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door, and every bone in my body was telling me to get up out of that chair and take for the hills.
But Joanne looked at me and talked to me like we were old friends.
And then she asked me, "Where'd you get your highlights done?
" (Laughter) And I was like, are you kidding me?
You're going to talk to me about my hair when I'm on the verge of losing it?
She really believed that.
And so I believed it, too.
Now, worrying about losing your hair when you're fighting cancer may seem silly at first, but it's not just that you're worried about how you're going to look.
It's that you're worried that everybody's going to treat you so carefully.Joanne made me feel normal for the first time in six months.
We talked about her boyfriends, we talked about looking for apartments in New York City, and we talked about my reaction to the chemotherapy -- all kind of mixed in together.
And I always wondered, how did she so instinctively know just how to talk to me?
Joanne Staha and my admiration for her marked the beginning of my journey into the world of nurses.
A few years later, I was asked to do a project that would celebrate the work that nurses do.
I started with Joanne, and I met over 100 nurses across the country.
Then we asked hospitals and facilities to nominate nurses who would best represent them.
One of the first nurses I met was Bridget Kumbella. Bridget was born in Cameroon, the oldest of four children.
Her father was at work when he had fallen from the fourth floor and really hurt his back.
And he talked a lot about what it was like to be flat on your back and not get the kind of care that you need.
And that propelled Bridget to go into the profession of nursing.
Now, as a nurse in the Bronx, she has a really diverse group of patients that she cares for, from all walks of life, and from all different religions. And she's devoted her career to understanding the impact of our cultural differences when it comes to our health.
She spoke of a patient -- a Native American patient that she had -- that wanted to bring a bunch of feathers into the ICU.
That's how he found spiritual comfort.
And she spoke of advocating for him and said that patients come from all different religions and use all different kinds of objects for comfort; whether it's a holy rosary or a symbolic feather, it all needs to be supported.
This is Jason Short. Jason is a home health nurse in the Appalachian mountains, and his dad had a gas station and a repair shop when he was growing up.
So he worked on cars in the community that he now serves as a nurse.
When he was in college, it was just not macho at all to become a nurse, so he avoided it for years.
He drove trucks for a little while, but his life path was always pulling him back to nursing.
As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains, Jason goes places that an ambulance can't even get to.
In this photograph, he's standing in what used to be a road.
Top of the mountain mining flooded that road, and now the only way for Jason to get to the patient living in that house with black lung disease is to drive his SUV against the current up that creek.
The day I was with him, we ripped the front fender off the car.
The next morning he got up, put the car on the lift, fixed the fender, and then headed out to meet his next patient.
I witnessed Jason caring for this gentleman with such enormous compassion, and I was struck again by how intimate the work of nursing really is.
When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.
He had just come back from a deployment and he hadn't really settled back in to life in San Diego yet.
He talked about his experience of being a nurse in Germany and taking care of the soldiers coming right off the battlefield.
Very often, he would be the first person they would see when they opened their eyes in the hospital.
And they would look at him as they were lying there, missing limbs, and the first thing they would say is, "When can I go back? I left my brothers out there.
" And Brian would have to say, "You're not going anywhere.
You've already given enough, brother.
" Brian is both a nurse and a soldier who's seen combat. So that puts him in a unique position to be able to relate to and help heal the veterans in his care.
This is Sister Stephen, and she runs a nursing home in Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.
And the entire circle of life can be found under her roof.
She grew up wishing they lived on a farm, so given the opportunity to adopt local farm animals, she enthusiastically brings them in.
And in the springtime, those animals have babies. And Sister Stephen uses those baby ducks, goats and lambs as animal therapy for the residents at Villa Loretto who sometimes can't remember their own name, but they do rejoice in the holding of a baby lamb.
The day I was with Sister Stephen, I needed to take her away from Villa Loretto to film part of her story.
And before we left, she went into the room of a dying patient.
And she leaned over and she said, "I have to go away for the day, but if Jesus calls you, you go.
You go straight home to Jesus.
" I was standing there and thinking it was the first time in my life I witnessed that you could show someone you love them completely by letting go. We don't have to hold on so tightly.
I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto than I have ever seen at any other time at any other place in my life.
We live in a complicated time when it comes to our health care.
It's easy to lose sight of the need for quality of life, not just quantity of life.
As new life-saving technologies are created, we're going to have really complicated decisions to make.
These technologies often save lives, but they can also prolong pain and the dying process.
How in the world are we supposed to navigate these waters?
We're going to need all the help we can get.
Nurses have a really unique relationship with us because of the time spent at bedside.
During that time, a kind of emotional intimacy develops.
This past summer, on August 9, my father died of a heart attack.
My mother was devastated, and she couldn't imagine her world without him in it.
Four days later she fell, she broke her hip, she needed surgery and she found herself fighting for her own life.
Once again I found myself on the receiving end of the care of nurses -- this time for my mom.
My brother and my sister and I stayed by her side for the next three days in the ICU.
And as we tried to make the right decisions and follow my mother's wishes, we found that we were depending upon the guidance of nurses.
And once again, they didn't let us down.
They had an amazing insight in terms of how to care for my mom in the last four days of her life.
They brought her comfort and relief from pain.
They knew to encourage my sister and I to put a pretty nightgown on my mom, long after it mattered to her, but it sure meant a lot to us.
And they knew to come and wake me up just in time for my mom's last breath.
And then they knew how long to leave me in the room with my mother after she died.
I have no idea how they know these things, but I do know that I am eternally grateful that they've guided me once again.
Thank you so very much.
(Applause)
Getting a college education is a 20-year investment.
When you're growing up poor, you're not accustomed to thinking that far ahead.
Instead, you're thinking about where you're going to get your next meal and how your family is going to pay rent that month.
Besides, my parents and my friends' parents seemed to be doing just fine driving taxis and working as janitors.
It wasn't until I was a teenager when I realized I didn't want to do those things.
By then, I was two-thirds of the way through my education, and it was almost too late to turn things around.
When you grow up poor, you want to be rich.
I was no different.
I'm the second-oldest of seven, and was raised by a single mother on government aid in Queens, New York.
By virtue of growing up low-income, my siblings and I went to some of New York City's most struggling public schools.
I had over 60 absences when I was in seventh grade, because I didn't feel like going to class.
My high school had a 55 percent graduation rate, and even worse, only 20 percent of the kids graduating were college-ready.
When I actually did make it to college, I told my friend Brennan how our teachers would always ask us to raise our hands if we were going to college.
I was taken aback when Brennan said, "Karim, I've never been asked that question before.
" It was always, "What college are you going to?
" Just the way that question is phrased made it unacceptable for him not to have gone to college.
Nowadays I get asked a different question. "How were you able to make it out?
" For years I said I was lucky, but it's not just luck.
That's when my older brother's trajectory began to make complete sense to me.
I also learned that our most admirable education reformers, people like Arne Duncan, the former US Secretary of Education, or Wendy Kopp, the founder of Teach For America, had never attended an inner city public school like I had.
" Today when I get questions about how I made it out, I share that one of the biggest reasons is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.
In a typical middle class or affluent household, if a kid is struggling, there's a good chance that a parent or a teacher will come to their rescue even if they don't ask for help.
However, if that same kid is growing up poor and doesn't ask for help, there's a good chance that no one will help them.
There are virtually no social safety nets available.
So seven years ago, I started to reform our public education system shaped by my firsthand perspective.
And I started with summer school.
Research tells us that two-thirds of the achievement gap, which is the disparity in educational attainment between rich kids and poor kids or black kids and white kids, could be directly attributed to the summer learning loss.
In low-income neighborhoods, kids forget almost three months of what they learned during the school year over the summer.
They return to school in the fall, and their teachers spend another two months reteaching them old material.
That's five months.
The school year in the United States is only 10 months. If kids lose five months of learning every single year, that's half of their education. Half. If kids were in school over the summer, then they couldn't regress, but traditional summer school is poorly designed.
For kids it feels like punishment, and for teachers it feels like babysitting.
But how can we expect principals to execute an effective summer program when the school year ends the last week of June and then summer school starts just one week later?
There just isn't enough time to find the right people, sort out the logistics, and design an engaging curriculum that excites kids and teachers.
But what if we created a program over the summer that empowered teachers as teaching coaches to develop aspiring educators? What if we empowered college-educated role models as teaching fellows to help kids realize their college ambitions?
What if empowered high-achieving kids as mentors to tutor their younger peers and inspire them to invest in their education?
What if we empowered all kids as scholars, asked them what colleges they were going to, designed a summer school they want to attend to completely eliminate the summer learning loss and close two-thirds of the achievement gap?
By this summer, my team will have served over 4,000 low-income children, trained over 300 aspiring teachers and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs across some of New York City's most disadvantaged neighborhoods.
(Applause) And our kids are succeeding.
Two years of independent evaluations tell us that our kids eliminate the summer learning loss and make growth of one month in math and two months in reading.
" What's even more exciting is that if we can prevent five months of lost time just by redesigning two months, imagine the possibilities that we can unlock by tackling the rest of the calendar year.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Last year . . . was hell.
On some days, I could do no work.
On other days, I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.
My doctor asked if I'd like to speak with a mental health professional about my stress and anxiety.
Mental health?
I clammed up and violently shook my head in protest.
I felt a profound sense of a shame.
I felt the weight of stigma.
I have a loving, supportive family and incredibly loyal friends, yet I could not entertain the idea of speaking to anyone about my feeling of pain. I felt suffocated by the rigid architecture of our African masculinity.
"People have real problems, Sangu.
Get over yourself!
" The first time I heard "mental health," I was a boarding school student fresh off the boat from Ghana, at the Peddie School in New Jersey.
I had just gone through the brutal experience of losing seven loved ones in the same month.
The school nurse, concerned about what I'd gone through -- God bless her soul -- she inquired about my mental health.
"Is she mental?
" I thought.
Does she not know I'm an African man?
(Laughter) Like Okonkwo in "Things Fall Apart," we African men neither process nor express our emotions.
We deal with our problems.
(Applause) We deal with our problems.
I called my brother and laughed about "Oyibo" people -- white people -- and their strange diseases -- depression, ADD and those "weird things.
" Growing up in West Africa, when people used the term "mental," what came to mind was a madman with dirty, dread-locked hair, bumbling around half-naked on the streets.
We all know this man.
Our parents warned us about him.
"Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?
" "Drugs!
If you even look at drugs, you end up like him.
" (Laughter) Come down with pneumonia, and your mother will rush you to the nearest hospital for medical treatment.
But dare to declare depression, and your local pastor will be driving out demons and blaming witches in your village.
According to the World Health Organization, mental health is about being able to cope with the normal stressors of life; to work productively and fruitfully; and to be able to make a contribution to your community.
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being.
Globally, 75 percent of all mental illness cases can be found in low-income countries.
Yet most African governments invest less than one percent of their health care budget in mental health.
Even worse, we have a severe shortage of psychiatrists in Africa.
Nigeria, for example, is estimated to have 200 -- in a country of almost 200 million.
In all of Africa, 90 percent of our people lack access to treatment.
As a result, we suffer in solitude, silenced by stigma.
We as Africans often respond to mental health with distance, ignorance, guilt, fear and anger.
In a study conducted by Arboleda-Flórez, directly asking, "What is the cause of mental illness?
" 34 percent of Nigerian respondents cited drug misuse; 19 percent said divine wrath and the will of God -- (Laughter) 12 percent, witchcraft and spiritual possession.
But few cited other known causes of mental illness, like genetics, socioeconomic status, war, conflict or the loss of a loved one.
The stigmatization against mental illness often results in the ostracizing and demonizing of sufferers.
Photojournalist Robin Hammond has documented some of these abuses . . . in Uganda, in Somalia, and here in Nigeria.
For me, the stigma is personal.
In 2009, I received a frantic call in the middle of the night.
My best friend in the world -- a brilliant, philosophical, charming, hip young man -- was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
I witnessed some of the friends we'd grown up with recoil.
I heard the snickers. I heard the whispers.
"Did you hear he has gone mad?
" (Kru English) "He has gone crazy!
" Derogatory, demeaning commentary about his condition -- words we would never say about someone with cancer or someone with malaria.
Somehow, when it comes to mental illness, our ignorance eviscerates all empathy.
I stood by his side as his community isolated him, but our love never wavered.
Tacitly, I became passionate about mental health.
Inspired by his plight, I helped found the mental health special interest alumni group at my college.
And during my tenure as a resident tutor in graduate school, I supported many undergraduates with their mental health challenges.
I saw African students struggle and unable to speak to anyone.
Even with this knowledge and with their stories in tow, I, in turn, struggled, and could not speak to anyone when I faced my own anxiety, so deep is our fear of being the madman.
All of us -- but we Africans especially -- need to realize that our mental struggles do not detract from our virility, nor does our trauma taint our strength.
We need to see mental health as important as physical health.
We need to stop suffering in silence.
We must stop stigmatizing disease and traumatizing the afflicted.
Talk to your friends.
Talk to your loved ones.
Talk to health professionals.
Be vulnerable.
Do so with the confidence that you are not alone.
Speak up if you're struggling.
Being honest about how we feel does not make us weak; it makes us human.
It is time to end the stigma associated with mental illness.
So the next time your hear "mental," do not just think of the madman.
Think of me.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
Let's say you despise Western democracy.
Democracy, in all its trappings, free elections, town halls, endless debates about the proper role of government.
Too messy, too unpredictable, too constraining for your taste. And the way these democracies band together and lecture everyone else about individual rights and freedoms -- it gets under your skin.
So what to do about it?
You can call out the hypocrisy and failures of Western democracies and explain how your way is better, but that's never really worked for you.
What if you could get the people whose support is the very foundation of these democracies to start questioning the system?
Make the idea occur in their own minds that democracy and its institutions are failing them, their elite are corrupt puppet masters and the country they knew is in free fall.
After that, various online personas, like a supposed Romanian cybercriminal who didn't speak Romanian, aggressively pushed news of these leaks to journalists.
The media took the bait.
They were consumed by how much the DNC hated Bernie. At the time, it was that narrative that far outshined the news that a group of Russian government sponsored hackers who we called "Advanced Persistent Threat 28," or "APT28" for short, was carrying out these operations against the US.
And there was no shortage of evidence.
But what Russia was doing in 2016 went far beyond espionage.
The DNC hack was just one of many where stolen data was posted online accompanied by a sensational narrative, then amplified in social media for lightning-speed adoption by the media.
Why did it take months before Americans understood that they were under a state-sponsored information attack?
The easy answer is politics.
The Obama Administration was caught in a perfect catch-22. By raising the specter that the Russian government was interfering in the US presidential campaign, the Administration risked appearing to meddle in the campaign itself.
Before the first iPhone even hit the shelf, the Russian government understood the risks and the opportunity that technology provided and the inter-communication and instant communication it provided us.
" It's the ability to use information on someone else so that they make a decision on their own accord that's favorable to you.
This is nation-state-grade image control and perception management, and it's conducted by any means, with any tools, network-based or otherwise, that will achieve it.
Take this for another example. In early February 2014, a few weeks before Russia would invade Crimea, a phone call is posted on YouTube.
In it, there's two US diplomats.
They sound like they're playing kingmaker in Ukraine, and worse, they curse the EU for its lack of speed and leadership in resolving the crisis.
The media covers the phone call, and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash leaves Washington and Europe reeling.
And it creates a fissured response and a feckless attitude towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.
Mission accomplished.
So while hacked phone calls and emails and networks keep grabbing the headlines, the real operations are the ones that are influencing the decisions you make and the opinions you hold, all in the service of a nation-state's strategic interest.
This is power in the information age.
And this information is all that much more seductive, all that much easier to take at face value and pass on, when it's authentic.
This is a network composed of minds interacting with computers and devices.
And for this network, there's no encryption, there's no firewall, no two-factor authentication, no password complex enough to protect you.
What you have for defense is far stronger, it's more adaptable, it's always running the latest version. It's the ability to think critically: call out falsehood, press for the facts.
And above all, you must have the courage to unflinchingly pursue the truth. (Applause)
I want to tell you a story about a girl. But I can't tell you her real name. So let's just call her Hadiza. Hadiza is 20. She's shy, but she has a beautiful smile that lights up her face.
In this day and age, we're all publishers, and we have responsibility.In my job as a journalist, I check, I verify.I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.Why is this person telling me this story?What do they have to gain by sharing this information?
Do they have a hidden agenda?
I really believe that we must all start to ask tougher questions of information that we discover online. Research shows that some of us don't even read beyond headlines before we share stories. Who here has done that?
I know I have. But what if we stopped taking information that we discover at face value?
What if we stop to think about the consequence of the information that we pass on and its potential to incite violence or hatred?
What if we stop to think about the real-life consequences of the information that we share?
Thank you very much for listening. (Applause)I want to tell you a story about a girl. But I can't tell you her real name. So let's just call her Hadiza. Hadiza is 20. She's shy, but she has a beautiful smile that lights up her face.

I was 14 years old inside of a bowling alley, burglarizing an arcade game, and upon exiting the building a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.
" (Laughter) I was taken to juvenile hall and when I was released into the custody of my mother, the first words my uncle said was, "How'd you get caught?
" I said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy.
" He said, "Man, you weren't supposed to take all the quarters.
" I said, "Man, they were small.
What am I supposed to do?
" And 10 minutes later, he took me to burglarize another arcade game.
We needed gas money to get home.
That was my life.
I grew up in Oakland, California, with my mother and members of my immediate family addicted to crack cocaine.
My environment consisted of living with family, friends, and homeless shelters.
Oftentimes, dinner was served in breadlines and soup kitchens.
The big homey told me this: money rules the world and everything in it.
And in these streets, money is king.
And if you follow the money, it'll lead you to the bad guy or the good guy.
Soon after, I committed my first crime, and it was the first time that I was told that I had potential and felt like somebody believed in me.
Nobody ever told me that I could be a lawyer, doctor or engineer.
I mean, how was I supposed to do that?
I couldn't read, write or spell.
I was illiterate.
So I always thought crime was my way to go.
And then one day I was talking to somebody and he was telling me about this robbery that we could do.
And we did it.
The reality was that I was growing up in the strongest financial nation in the world, the United States of America, while I watched my mother stand in line at a blood bank to sell her blood for 40 dollars just to try to feed her kids.
She still has the needle marks on her arms to day to show for that.
So I never cared about my community.
They didn't care about my life.
Everybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted, the drug dealers, the robbers, the blood bank. Everybody was taking blood money.
So I got mine by any means necessary.
I got mine.
Financial literacy really did rule the world, and I was a child slave to it following the bad guy.
At 17 years old, I was arrested for robbery and murder and I soon learned that finances in prison rule more than they did on the streets, so I wanted in.
One day, I rushed to grab the sports page of the newspaper so my cellie could read it to me, and I accidentally picked up the business section.
And this old man said, "Hey youngster, you pick stocks?
" And I said, "What's that?
" He said, "That's the place where white folks keep all their money.
" (Laughter) And it was the first time that I saw a glimpse of hope, a future.
He gave me this brief description of what stocks were, but it was just a glimpse.
I mean, how was I supposed to do it?
I couldn't read, write or spell.
The skills that I had developed to hide my illiteracy no longer worked in this environment.
I was trapped in a cage, prey among predators, fighting for freedom I never had.
I was lost, tired, and I was out of options.
So at 20 years old, I did the hardest thing I'd ever done in my life.
I picked up a book, and it was the most agonizing time of my life, trying to learn how to read, the ostracizing from my family, the homeys.
It was rough, man.
It was a struggle.
But little did I know I was receiving the greatest gifts I had ever dreamed of: self-worth, knowledge, discipline.
I was so excited to be reading that I read everything I could get my hands on: candy wrappers, clothing logos, street signs, everything.
I was just reading stuff!
(Applause) Just reading stuff.
I was so excited to know how to read and know how to spell.
The homey came up, said, "Man, what you eating?
" I said, "C-A-N-D-Y, candy.
" (Laughter) He said, "Let me get some.
" I said, "N-O. No. " (Laughter) It was awesome.
I mean, I can actually now for the first time in my life read.
The feeling that I got from it was amazing.
And then at 22, feeling myself, feeling confident, I remembered what the OG told me.
So I picked up the business section of the newspaper.
I wanted to find these rich white folks.
(Laughter) So I looked for that glimpse.
As I furthered my career in teaching others how to financially manage money and invest, I soon learned that I had to take responsibility for my own actions.
True, I grew up in a very complex environment, but I chose to commit crimes, and I had to own up to that.
I had to take responsibility for that, and I did.
I was building a curriculum that could teach incarcerated men how to manage money through prison employments.
Properly managing our lifestyle would provide transferrable tools that we can use to manage money when we reenter society, like the majority of people did who didn't commit crimes.
Then I discovered that according to MarketWatch, over 60 percent of the American population has under 1,000 dollars in savings.
Sports Illustrated said that over 60 percent of NBA players and NFL players go broke.
40 percent of marital problems derive from financial issues.
What the hell?
(Laughter) You mean to tell me that people worked their whole lives, buying cars, clothes, homes and material stuff but were living check to check?
How in the world were members of society going to help incarcerated individuals back into society if they couldn't manage they own stuff?
We screwed.
(Laughter) I needed a better plan.
This is not going to work out too well.
So . . . I thought.
Ask yourselves this: How can 50 percent of the American population be financially illiterate in a nation driven by financial prosperity?
Our access to justice, our social status, living conditions, transportation and food are all dependent on money that most people can't manage.
It's crazy!
It's an epidemic and a bigger danger to public safety than any other issue.
According to the California Department of Corrections, over 70 percent of those incarcerated have committed or have been charged with money-related crimes: robberies, burglaries, fraud, larceny, extortion -- and the list goes on.
Don't come back to prison.
" With no meaningful preparation or long-term financial plan, what does he do . . . ?
At 60? Get a good job, or go back to the very criminal behavior that led him to prison in the first place?
You taxpayers, you choose.
Well, his education already chose for him, probably.
So how do we cure this disease?
You can't have full rehabilitation without these life skills.
This idea that only professionals can invest and manage money is absolutely ridiculous, and whoever told you that is lying.
(Applause) A professional is a person who knows his craft better than most, and nobody knows how much money you need, have or want better than you, which means you are the professional.
Financial literacy is not a skill, ladies and gentlemen. It's a lifestyle.
Financial stability is a byproduct of a proper lifestyle.
A financially sound incarcerated person can become a taxpaying citizen, and a financially sound taxpaying citizen can remain one.
This allows us to create a bridge between those people who we influence: family, friends and those young people who still believe that crime and money are related.
So let's lose the fear and anxiety of all the big financial words and all that other nonsense that you've been out there hearing.
And let's get to the heart of what's been crippling our society from taking care of your responsibility to be better life managers.
And let's provide a simple and easy to use curriculum that gets to the heart, the heart of what financial empowerment and emotional literacy really is.
Now, if you're sitting out here in the audience and you said, "Oh yeah, well, that ain't me and I don't buy it," then come take my class -- (Laughter) so I can show you how much money it costs you every time you get emotional.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
Thank you.(Applause)I was 14 years old inside of a bowling alley, burglarizing an arcade game, and upon exiting the building a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.
I ran down the street, and I jumped on top of a fence. And when I got to the top, the weight of 3,000 quarters in my book bag pulled me back down to the ground.
So when I came to, the security guard was standing on top of me, and he said, "Next time you little punks steal something you can carry.
" (Laughter) I was taken to juvenile hall and when I was released into the custody of my mother, the first words my uncle said was, "How'd you get caught?
" I said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy.
" He said, "Man, you weren't supposed to take all the quarters.
" I said, "Man, they were small.
What am I supposed to do?
" And 10 minutes later, he took me to burglarize another arcade game.
We needed gas money to get home.
That was my life.
I grew up in Oakland, California, with my mother and members of my immediate family addicted to crack cocaine.
My environment consisted of living with family, friends, and homeless shelters.
Oftentimes, dinner was served in breadlines and soup kitchens.
The big homey told me this: money rules the world and everything in it.
And in these streets, money is king.
And if you follow the money, it'll lead you to the bad guy or the good guy.
I mean, how was I supposed to do that?
I couldn't read, write or spell.
I was illiterate.
So I always thought crime was my way to go.
And then one day I was talking to somebody and he was telling me about this robbery that we could do.
And we did it.
The reality was that I was growing up in the strongest financial nation in the world, the United States of America, while I watched my mother stand in line at a blood bank to sell her blood for 40 dollars just to try to feed her kids.
She still has the needle marks on her arms to day to show for that.
So I never cared about my community.
They didn't care about my life.
Everybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted, the drug dealers, the robbers, the blood bank. Everybody was taking blood money.
So I got mine by any means necessary.
I got mine.
Financial literacy really did rule the world, and I was a child slave to it following the bad guy.
At 17 years old, I was arrested for robbery and murder and I soon learned that finances in prison rule more than they did on the streets, so I wanted in.
And this old man said, "Hey youngster, you pick stocks?
" He said, "That's the place where white folks keep all their money.
I mean, how was I supposed to do it?
I couldn't read, write or spell.
The skills that I had developed to hide my illiteracy no longer worked in this environment.
I was trapped in a cage, prey among predators, fighting for freedom I never had.
I was lost, tired, and I was out of options.

(Laughter) I needed a better plan.
This is not going to work out too well.
So . . . I thought.
I now had an obligation to meet those on the path and help, and it was crazy because I now cared about my community. Wow, imagine that. I cared about my community.
Financial illiteracy is a disease that has crippled minorities and the lower class in our society for generations and generations, and we should be furious about that.
Ask yourselves this: How can 50 percent of the American population be financially illiterate in a nation driven by financial prosperity?
Our access to justice, our social status, living conditions, transportation and food are all dependent on money that most people can't manage.

We all have milestones in life that we remember so vividly.
The first one for me was when I was entering kindergarten.
My big brother was in school, and by golly, it was my time.
And I went trottin' down that hallway.
I was so excited, I almost wet myself.
And I go to the door, and there was the teacher with a warm welcome, and she took me into the classroom, showed me my little cubbyhole -- we all remember those little cubbyholes, don't we -- and we put our stuff in there.
And then she said, "Go over to the circle and play with the kids until class starts.
" And I just kept playing.
I didn't think he was talking to me.
(Laughter) And in a louder voice, he said, "Hey, why are you so short?
" So I looked up and I said, "What are you talking about?
Let's just play.
We're happy.
I've been waiting for this.
" And so we played, and about a minute later, the girl next to him, in a white shirt and a pink skirt, stood up, put her hands on her hips, and said, "Yeah, why do you look so different?
" And I went, "What are you talking about?
I don't look different.
I'm not short.
Again, let's just play.
" About this time, I looked all around the circle I was in, and all the kids had stopped playing and they were all looking at me.
And I'm thinking -- in today's language, it would be "OMG" or "WTF. " (Laughter) What just happened?
So all the confidence that I went in with that morning was withering away as the morning went on and the questions kept coming.
And at the end of the morning, before I went home, the teacher had us in a circle, and I actually found myself outside of the circle.
I couldn't look at anybody.
I could not understand what just happened.
And over the next few years, I hated to go out in public. I felt every stare, every giggle, every pointed finger, not the finger, but every pointed finger, and I hated it.
I would hide behind my parents' legs like nobody could see me.
And as a child, you can't understand another child's curiosity, nor an adult's ignorance.
It became very apparent to me that the real world was not built for someone of my size, both literally or figuratively.
And so I have no anonymity, as you can probably tell, and while you can see my size, we all go through many challenges through our lifetime.
And some you can see, like mine. Most you can't.
You can't tell if someone's dealing with a mental illness, or they're struggling with their gender identity, they're caring for an aging parent, they're having financial difficulty.
You can't see that kind of stuff.
So while you can see one of my challenges is my size, seeing does not mean you understand what it's truly to be me on a daily basis, or what I go through.
And so I'm here to debunk a myth.
I do not believe you can walk in someone else's shoes, and because of that, we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves. Simply stated, I will never know what it's like to be you and you will never know what it's like to be me.
I cannot face your fears or chase your dreams, and you can't do that for me, but we can be supportive of each other.
Heh, heh, heh. I was equal.
As a matter of fact, I excelled in the classroom.
This was vitally important, I discovered as I grew older and realized I wasn't going to be able to do a physical job.
I needed an education.
So I went on and got a university degree, but I felt to be one step ahead of everyone for employment, I needed to have an advanced university degree, so I went ahead and got that.
Remember your first interview?
What am I going to wear?
" And she knew I couldn't climb steps.
So I went early and found a loading dock and got in and had a great interview.
(Laughter) And I especially don't run through the TSA because I get to experience the personal patdown.
I can't reach the lock.
" So I'm in there doing my business, and the door flies open. And there's a gentleman there with a look of horror on his face.
I'm sure I had the same look.
A few years ago, I was in Zanzibar, and I come wheeling in, and think about that.
Short, white, blond woman in a chair.
And once I got on the flight, he patted me on the back and wished me well, and I thanked him so much.
And again, I think he's going to remember that experience more than when I first came in, and there was a bit of hesitation.
And as you notice, I get a lot of help.
I would not be where I am today if it was not for my family, my friends, my colleagues and the many strangers that help me every single day of my life.
The realest word we have. That is the closest thing we have to a master key. That's the most commonly understood word in the world, no matter where you are.
The problem with that is, no one seems to know what those two letters stand for. (Laughter) Which is kind of weird, right?
I mean, it could be a misspelling of "all correct," I guess, or "old kinderhook.
They don't have meaning. We do.
" Thank you.
(Applause)
" Honestly, I never heard a male firefighter asked this.
And I became curious. Why wasn't bravery expected of women?
But the little boys? They were encouraged to play on the fire pole despite any trepidations that they might have, and often the parents offered guidance on how to use it on their own. So what message does this send to both boys and girls?
This story starts with these two -- my kids. We were hiking in the Oakland woods when my daughter noticed a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek. She looked at me and said, "Daddy? That doesn't go there.
So I started telling people what I was doing, and they started participating.One day, this photo showed up from China. And that's when I realized that Litterati was more than just pretty pictures; we were becoming a community that was collecting data.
My two kids go to school right in that bullseye. Litter: it's blending into the background of our lives. But what if we brought it to the forefront?
What if we understood exactly what was on our streets, our sidewalks and our school yards?
How might we use that data to make a difference?
Well, let me show you. The first is with cities. San Francisco wanted to understand what percentage of litter was cigarettes.
Why?
To create a tax.
The city called me and asked if our technology could help.
I'm not sure they realized that our technology was my Instagram account -- (Laughter) But I said, "Yes, we can.
If you could generate a revenue stream just by understanding the percentage of cigarettes, well, what about coffee cups or soda cans or plastic bottles?
If you could fingerprint San Francisco, well, how about Oakland or Amsterdam or somewhere much closer to home?
And what about brands?
How might they use this data to align their environmental and economic interests?
There's a block in downtown Oakland that's covered in blight. The Litterati community got together and picked up 1,500 pieces.
" And they stopped. And they learned that individually they could each make a difference, but together they created an impact. It doesn't matter if you're a student or a scientist, whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi, this is a community for everyone.
It started because of two little kids in the Northern California woods, and today it's spread across the world. And you know how we're getting there?
One piece at a time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Mastering any physical skill, be it performing a pirouette, playing an instrument, or throwing a baseball, takes practice.
Practice is the repetition of an action with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease, speed, and confidence.
So what does practice do in our brains to make us better at things?
Our brains have two kinds of neural tissue: grey matter and white matter.
The grey matter processes information in the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli to nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up of fatty tissue and nerve fibers.
In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from the brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers called axons to our muscles.
So how does practice or repetition affect the inner workings of our brains?
The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance called myelin.
And it's this myelin covering, or sheath, that seems to change with practice.
Myelin is similar to insulation on electrical cables.
It prevents energy loss from electrical signals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently along neural pathways.
Some recent studies in mice suggest that the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath that insulates the axons.
And the more layers, the greater the insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway for information connecting your brain to your muscles.
So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes to muscle memory, muscles themselves don't really have memory.
Rather, it may be the myelination of neural pathways that gives these athletes and performers their edge with faster and more efficient neural pathways.
There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours, days, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill.
While we don't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery isn't simply about the amount of hours of practice.
It's also the quality and effectiveness of that practice.
Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge of one's current abilities.
So if effective practice is the key, how can we get the most out of our practice time?
Try these tips.
Focus on the task at hand.
Minimize potential distractions by turning off the computer or TV and putting your cell phone on airplane mode.
In one study, researchers observed 260 students studying.
On average, those students were able to stay on task for only six minutes at a time.
Laptops, smartphones, and particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions.
Start out slowly or in slow-motion.
Coordination is built with repetitions, whether correct or incorrect.
If you gradually increase the speed of the quality repetitons, you have a better chance of doing them correctly.
Next, frequent repetitions with allotted breaks are common practice habits of elite performers.
Studies have shown that many top athletes, musicians, and dancers spend 50-60 hours per week on activities related to their craft.
Many divide their time used for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions of limited duration.
And finally, practice in your brain in vivid detail.
It's a bit surprising, but a number of studies suggest that once a physical motion has been established, it can be reinforced just by imagining it.
In one study, 144 basketball players were divided into two groups.
Group A physically practiced one-handed free throws while Group B only mentally practiced them.
When they were tested at the end of the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced players in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount.
As scientists get closer to unraveling the secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice will only improve.
In the meantime, effective practice is the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential.
That patient was my government. (Laughter) See, many of us will agree that lots of governments are unhealthy today. (Laughter) (Applause) And Kenya was no exception.
When I returned to Kenya in 2014, there was 17 percent youth unemployment. And Nairobi, the major business hub, was rated 177th on the quality of living index. It was bad.
Well, in Kenya it was taking 72 days for a business owner to register their property, compared to just one day in New Zealand, which was ranked second on the World Bank list. It took 158 days to get a new electric connection. In Korea it took 18 days.
If you wanted to get a construction permit so you could put up a building, in Kenya, it was going to take you 125 days. In Singapore, which is ranked first, that would only take you 26 days.
God forbid you had to go to court to get help in being able to settle a dispute to enforce a contract, because that process alone would take you 465 days.
When we started out, I thought I was going to find so much corruption, I was literally going to either die or get killed in the process.
And with them, we made sure that they understood how their day-to-day actions were impacting our ability as a country to create new jobs and to attract investments. No one's role was too small; everyone's role was vital. Now, guess what we started to see?
A coalition of government employees who are excited and ready to drive change, began to grow and form. And together we started to implement changes that impacted the service delivery of our country. The result?
In just two years, Kenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92. (Applause) And in recognition of the significant reforms we've been able to implement in such a short time, Kenya was recognized to be among the top three global reformers in the world two years in a row.
(Applause) Are we fully healthy? No. We have some serious work still to do.
When is the last time you accessed a government service?
Maybe applied for your driver's license, tried to do your taxes on your own.
It's easy in this political and global economy to want to give up when we think about transforming government. We can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking that government is too inefficient, too corrupt, unfixable.
We might even rarely get some key government responsibilities to other sectors, to Band-Aid solutions, or to just give up and feel helpless.
(Applause)
What's your sign?
In Western astrology, it's a constellation determined by when your birthday falls in the calendar.
But according to the Chinese zodiac, or shēngxiào, it's your shǔxiàng, meaning the animal assigned to your birth year.
And of the many myths explaining these animal signs and their arrangement, the most enduring one is that of the Great Race.
As the story goes, Yù Dì, or Jade Emperor, Ruler of the Heavens, wanted to devise a way to measure time, so he organized a race.
The first twelve animals to make it across the river would earn a spot on the zodiac calendar in the order they arrived.
The rat rose with the sun to get an early start, but on the way to the river, he met the horse, the tiger, and the ox.
Because the rat was small and couldn't swim very well, he asked the bigger animals for help.
While the tiger and horse refused, the kind-hearted ox agreed to carry the rat across.
Yet, just as they were about to reach the other side, the rat jumped off the ox's head and secured first place.
The ox came in second, with the powerful tiger right behind him.
The rabbit, too small to battle the current, nimbly hopped across stones and logs to come in fourth.
Next came the dragon, who could have flown directly across, but stopped to help some creatures she had encountered on the way.
The startled horse reared back, letting the snake sneak into sixth place.
The Jade Emperor looked out at the river and spotted the sheep, the monkey, and the rooster all atop a raft, working together to push it through the weeds.
When they made it across, the trio agreed to give eighth place to the sheep, who had been the most comforting and harmonious of them, followed by the monkey and the rooster.
Next came the dog, scrambling onto the shore.
He was a great swimmer, but frolicked in the water for so long that he only managed to come in eleventh.
The final spot was claimed by the pig, who had gotten hungry and stopped to eat and nap before finally waddling across the finish line.
And so, each year is associated with one of the animals in this order, with the cycle starting over every 60 years.
Why 60 and not twelve?
Well, the traditional Chinese calendar is made up of two overlapping systems.
The animals of the zodiac are associated with what's called the Twelve Earthly Branches, or shí'èrzhī.
Another system, the Ten Heavenly Stems, or tiāngān, is linked with the five classical elements of metal, xīn, wood, mù, water, shuǐ, fire, huǒ, and earth, tǔ.
Each element is assigned yīn or yáng, creating a ten-year cycle.
In fact, you can also have an inner animal based on your birth month, a true animal based on your birth date, and a secret animal based on your birth hour.
It was the great race that supposedly determined which animals were enshrined in the Chinese zodiac, but as the system spread through Asia, other cultures made changes to reflect their communities.
So if you consult the Vietnamese zodiac, you may discover that you're a cat, not a rabbit, and if you're in Thailand, a mythical snake called a Naga replaces the dragon.
So whether or not you place stock in what the zodiac says about you as an individual, it certainly reveals much about the culture it comes from.
If I asked you to picture the air, what do you imagine?
Most people think about either empty space or clear blue sky or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.
We notice it mostly when there's some kind of unpleasant sensory intrusion upon it, like a terrible smell or something visible like smoke or mist.
But it's always there.
It's touching all of us right now.
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.
So what is the air?
It's the combination of the invisible gases that envelop the Earth, attracted by the Earth's gravitational pull.
And even though I'm a visual artist, I'm interested in the invisibility of the air.
I'm interested in how we imagine it, how we experience it and how we all have an innate understanding of its materiality through breathing.
All life on Earth changes the air through gas exchange, and we're all doing it right now.
Actually, why don't we all right now together take one big, collective, deep breath in.
Ready? In. (Inhales) And out.
(Exhales) That air that you just exhaled, you enriched a hundred times in carbon dioxide.
So roughly five liters of air per breath, 17 breaths per minute of the 525,600 minutes per year, comes to approximately 45 million liters of air, enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide, just for you.
Now, that's equivalent to about 18 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
For me, air is plural.
It's simultaneously as small as our breathing and as big as the planet.
Through my visual arts practice, I try to make air, not so much picture it, but to make it visceral and tactile and haptic.
I try to expand this notion of the aesthetic, how things look, so that it can include things like how it feels on your skin and in your lungs, and how your voice sounds as it passes through it.
I explore the weight, density and smell, but most importantly, I think a lot about the stories we attach to different kinds of air.
This is a work I made in 2014. It's called "Different Kinds of Air: A Plant's Diary," where I was recreating the air from different eras in Earth's evolution, and inviting the audience to come in and breathe them with me.
And it's really surprising, so drastically different.
Now, I'm not a scientist, but atmospheric scientists will look for traces in the air chemistry in geology, a bit like how rocks can oxidize, and they'll extrapolate that information and aggregate it, such that they can pretty much form a recipe for the air at different times.
Then I come in as the artist and take that recipe and recreate it using the component gases.
I was particularly interested in moments of time that are examples of life changing the air, but also the air that can influence how life will evolve, like Carboniferous air.
It's from about 300 to 350 million years ago.
It's an era known as the time of the giants.
So for the first time in the history of life, lignin evolves.
That's the hard stuff that trees are made of.
So trees effectively invent their own trunks at this time, and they get really big, bigger and bigger, and pepper the Earth, releasing oxygen, releasing oxygen, releasing oxygen, such that the oxygen levels are about twice as high as what they are today.
And this rich air supports massive insects -- huge spiders and dragonflies with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.
To breathe, this air is really clean and really fresh.
It doesn't so much have a flavor, but it does give your body a really subtle kind of boost of energy.
It's really good for hangovers.
(Laughter) Or there's the air of the Great Dying -- that's about 252.5 million years ago, just before the dinosaurs evolve.
It's a really short time period, geologically speaking, from about 20- to 200,000 years.
Really quick.
This is the greatest extinction event in Earth's history, even bigger than when the dinosaurs died out.
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species at this time die out, and simultaneous to that is a huge, dramatic spike in carbon dioxide, that a lot of scientists agree comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes and a runaway greenhouse effect.
Oxygen levels at this time go to below half of what they are today, so about 10 percent.
So this air would definitely not support human life, but it's OK to just have a breath.
And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.
It's really calming, it's quite warm and it has a flavor a little bit like soda water.
And instead of being speculative with air and just making up what I think might be the future air, I discovered this human-synthesized air.
That means that it doesn't occur anywhere in nature, but it's made by humans in a laboratory for application in different industrial settings.
Why is it future air?
Well, this air is a really stable molecule that will literally be part of the air once it's released, for the next 300 to 400 years, before it's broken down.
So that's about 12 to 16 generations.
And this future air has some very sensual qualities.
It's very heavy.
It's about eight times heavier than the air we're used to breathing.
It's so heavy, in fact, that when you breathe it in, whatever words you speak are kind of literally heavy as well, so they dribble down your chin and drop to the floor and soak into the cracks.
It's an air that operates quite a lot like a liquid.
Now, this air comes with an ethical dimension as well. Humans made this air, but it's also the most potent greenhouse gas that has ever been tested.
Its warming potential is 24,000 times that of carbon dioxide, and it has that longevity of 12 to 16 generations.
So this ethical confrontation is really central to my work.
(In a lowered voice) It has another quite surprising quality.
It changes the sound of your voice quite dramatically.
(Laughter) So when we start to think -- ooh!
It's still there a bit.
(Laughter) When we think about climate change, we probably don't think about giant insects and erupting volcanoes or funny voices.
The images that more readily come to mind are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs.
We think about pie charts and column graphs and endless politicians talking to scientists wearing cardigans.
But perhaps it's time we start thinking about climate change on the same visceral level that we experience the air.
Like air, climate change is simultaneously at the scale of the molecule, the breath and the planet.
It's immediate, vital and intimate, as well as being amorphous and cumbersome.
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.
Climate change is the collective self-portrait of humanity.
It reflects our decisions as individuals, as governments and as industries.
And if there's anything I've learned from looking at air, it's that even though it's changing, it persists.
It may not support the kind of life that we'd recognize, but it will support something.
And if we humans are such a vital part of that change, I think it's important that we can feel the discussion.
Because even though it's invisible, humans are leaving a very vibrant trace in the air.
Thank you.
(Applause)If I asked you to picture the air, what do you imagine?
Most people think about either empty space or clear blue sky or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.
We notice it mostly when there's some kind of unpleasant sensory intrusion upon it, like a terrible smell or something visible like smoke or mist.
But it's always there.
It's touching all of us right now.
It's even inside us.
Our air is immediate, vital and intimate.
It's the combination of the invisible gases that envelop the Earth, attracted by the Earth's gravitational pull.
And even though I'm a visual artist, I'm interested in the invisibility of the air.
I'm interested in how we imagine it, how we experience it and how we all have an innate understanding of its materiality through breathing.
All life on Earth changes the air through gas exchange, and we're all doing it right now.
Actually, why don't we all right now together take one big, collective, deep breath in.
Ready? In. (Inhales) And out.
(Exhales) That air that you just exhaled, you enriched a hundred times in carbon dioxide.
So roughly five liters of air per breath, 17 breaths per minute of the 525,600 minutes per year, comes to approximately 45 million liters of air, enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide, just for you.
Now, that's equivalent to about 18 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
For me, air is plural.
It's simultaneously as small as our breathing and as big as the planet.
And it's kind of hard to picture.
Maybe it's impossible, and maybe it doesn't matter.
Through my visual arts practice, I try to make air, not so much picture it, but to make it visceral and tactile and haptic.
I try to expand this notion of the aesthetic, how things look, so that it can include things like how it feels on your skin and in your lungs, and how your voice sounds as it passes through it.
I explore the weight, density and smell, but most importantly, I think a lot about the stories we attach to different kinds of air.
This is a work I made in 2014. It's called "Different Kinds of Air: A Plant's Diary," where I was recreating the air from different eras in Earth's evolution, and inviting the audience to come in and breathe them with me.
And it's really surprising, so drastically different.
Now, I'm not a scientist, but atmospheric scientists will look for traces in the air chemistry in geology, a bit like how rocks can oxidize, and they'll extrapolate that information and aggregate it, such that they can pretty much form a recipe for the air at different times.
Then I come in as the artist and take that recipe and recreate it using the component gases.
I was particularly interested in moments of time that are examples of life changing the air, but also the air that can influence how life will evolve, like Carboniferous air.
It's from about 300 to 350 million years ago.
It's an era known as the time of the giants.
So for the first time in the history of life, lignin evolves.
That's the hard stuff that trees are made of.
So trees effectively invent their own trunks at this time, and they get really big, bigger and bigger, and pepper the Earth, releasing oxygen, releasing oxygen, releasing oxygen, such that the oxygen levels are about twice as high as what they are today.
And this rich air supports massive insects -- huge spiders and dragonflies with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.
(Laughter) Or there's the air of the Great Dying -- that's about 252.5 million years ago, just before the dinosaurs evolve.

So this air would definitely not support human life, but it's OK to just have a breath.
And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.
It's really calming, it's quite warm and it has a flavor a little bit like soda water.
It has that kind of spritz, quite pleasant.
So with all this thinking about air of the past, it's quite natural to start thinking about the air of the future.
And instead of being speculative with air and just making up what I think might be the future air, I discovered this human-synthesized air.
That means that it doesn't occur anywhere in nature, but it's made by humans in a laboratory for application in different industrial settings.
Why is it future air?
Well, this air is a really stable molecule that will literally be part of the air once it's released, for the next 300 to 400 years, before it's broken down.

(Applause)
Humans know the surprising prick of a needle, the searing pain of a stubbed toe and the throbbing of a toothache.
We can identify many types of pain and have multiple ways of treating it.
But what about other species?
How do the animals all around us experience pain?
It’s important that we find out.
We keep animals as pets, they enrich our environment, we farm many species for food, and we use them in experiments to advance science and human health. Animals are clearly important to us, so it’s equally important that we avoid causing them unnecessary pain.
For animals that are similar to us, like mammals, it's often obvious when they're hurting.
But there's a lot that isn't obvious, like whether pain relievers that work on us also help them. And the more different an animal is from us, the harder it is to understand their experience. How do you tell whether a shrimp is in pain?
A snake? A snail? In vertebrates— including humans— pain can be split into two distinct processes.
In the first, nerves in the skin sense something harmful and communicate that information to the spinal cord.
There, motor neurons activate movements that make us rapidly jerk away from the threat.
This is the physical recognition of harm called nociception. And nearly all animals, even those with very simple nervous systems, experience it.
Without this ability, animals would be unable to avoid harm and their survival would be threatened.
The second part is the conscious recognition of harm.
In humans, this occurs when the sensory neurons in our skin make a second round of connections via the spinal cord to the brain.
There, millions of neurons in multiple regions create the sensations of pain.
For us, this is a very complex experience associated with emotions like fear, panic and stress, which we can communicate to others.
But it’s harder to know exactly how animals experience this part the process, because most of them can’t show us what they feel.
However, we get clues from observing how animals behave.
Wild, hurt animals are known to nurse their wounds, make noises to show their distress, and become reclusive.
in the lab, scientists have discovered that animals like chickens and rats will self-administer pain-reducing drugs if they’re hurting.
Animals also avoid situations where they’ve been hurt before, which suggests awareness of threats.
We’ve reached the point that research has made us so sure that vertebrates recognize pain that it’s illegal in many countries to needlessly harm these animals.
But what about other types of animals, like invertebrates?
These animals aren't legally protected, partly because their behaviors are harder to read.
We can make good guesses about some of them, like oysters, worms and jellyfish.
These are examples of animals that either lack a brain or have a very simple one.
So an oyster may recoil when squirted with lemon juice, for instance, because of nociception.
But with such a simple nervous system, it’s unlikely to experience the conscious part of pain.
Other invertebrate animals are more complicated, though. 
Like the octopus, which has a sophisticated brain and is thought to be one of the most intelligent invertebrate animals.
Yet in many countries, people continue the practice of eating live octopus.
We also boil live crayfish, shrimp, and crabs, even though we don't really know how they're affected either.
This poses an ethical problem, because we may be causing these animals unnecessary suffering.
Scientific experimentation, though controversial, gives us some clues.
Tests on hermit crabs show that they’ll leave an undesirable shell if they’re zapped with electricity. 
But stay if it’s a good shell.
And octopi that might originally curl up an injured arm to protect it, will risk using it to catch prey.
That suggests that these animals make value judgments around sensory input, instead of just reacting reflexively to harm.
Meanwhile, crabs have been known to repeatedly rub a spot on their bodies where they’ve received an electric shock.
And even sea slugs flinch when they know they’re about to receive a noxious stimulus.
That means they have some memory of physical sensations.
We still have a lot to learn about animal pain.
As our knowledge grows, it may one day allow us to live in a world where we don’t cause pain needlessly.
Humans know the surprising prick of a needle, the searing pain of a stubbed toe and the throbbing of a toothache.

Imagine you're watching a runaway trolley barreling down the tracks straight towards five workers who can't escape.
You happen to be standing next to a switch that will divert the trolley onto a second track.
Do you sacrifice one person to save five?
This is the trolley problem, a version of an ethical dilemma that philosopher Philippa Foot devised in 1967. 
It's popular because it forces us to think about how to choose when there are no good choices.
But people don't always take the utilitarian view, which we can see by changing the trolley problem a bit.
This time, you're standing on a bridge over the track as the runaway trolley approaches.
Now there's no second track, but there is a very large man on the bridge next to you.
If you push him over, his body will stop the trolley, saving the five workers, but he'll die.
Our instincts tell us that deliberately causing someone's death is different than allowing them to die as collateral damage.
It just feels wrong for reasons that are hard to explain.
So is activity in an area of the brain associated with processing internal conflict.
If we want these actions to be ethical, we have to decide in advance how to value human life and judge the greater good.
I am a chef and a food policy guy, but I come from a whole family of teachers. My sister is a special ed teacher in Chicago. 
My father just retired after 25 years teaching fifth grade. My aunt and uncle were professors.
What did you do for women in the year it was time?
Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma?
Were you fooled by the epithets of "nasty" or "less than"?
Did you teach with an open heart or a clenched fist? Where were you?
What is a parent? What is a parent?
It's not an easy question.
Today we have adoption, stepfamilies, surrogate mothers. Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions.
Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation?
If so, when?
What words to use?
Sperm donors are often referred to as "biological fathers," but should we really be using the word "father?
" As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood.
But today, I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children.
I will show you that they know what matters most in a family, even though their family looks a little different.
I will show you their creative ways of dealing with tough questions.
But I will also show you the parents' uncertainties.
We interviewed couples who received fertility treatment at Ghent University Hospital, using sperm from a donor.
In this treatment timeline, you can see two points at which we conducted interviews.
We included heterosexual couples, where the man for some reason did not have good-quality sperm, and lesbian couples who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere.
We also included children.
I wanted to know how those children define concepts like parenthood and family.
In fact, that is what I asked them, only not in that way.
I drew an apple tree instead.
This way, I could ask abstract, philosophical questions in a way that did not make them run off.
So as you can see, the apple tree is empty.
And that illustrates my research approach.
By designing techniques like this, I can bring as little meaning and content as possible to the interview, because I want to hear that from them.
I asked them: What would your family look like if it were an apple tree?
And they could take a paper apple for everyone who, in their view, was a member of the family, write a name on it and hang it wherever they wanted. And I would ask questions.
Most children started with a parent or a sibling.
One started with "Boxer," the dead dog of his grandparents.
At this point, none of the children started mentioning the donor.
So, I asked them about their birth story.
I said, "Before you were born, it was just your mom and dad, or mom and mommy. Can you tell me how you came into the family?
" And they explained.
One said, "My parents did not have good seeds, but there are friendly men out there who have spare seeds.
They bring them to the hospital, and they put them in a big jar.
My mommy went there, and she took two from the jar, one for me and one for my sister.
She put the seeds in her belly -- somehow -- and her belly grew really big, and there I was.
" Hmm.
So only when they started mentioning the donor, I asked questions about him, using their own words.
I said, "If this would be an apple for the friendly man with the seeds, what would you do with it?
" And one boy was thinking out loud, holding the apple.
That's too cold and too hard.
So it is DIY: finding ways, words and images to tell your family story to your child.
And research so far shows that these children are doing fine.
And that fear is understandable, because we live in a very heteronormative and geneticized society -- a world that still believes that true families consist of one mom, one dad and their genetically related children. Well. 
I want to tell you about a teenage boy.
' we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.
' But we will say nothing more, not unless he asks, because he might not be ready for that.
The counselor said so.
" Well.
I don't know; that's quite different from how we respond to children's questions.
Like, "Milk -- is that made in a factory?
" We will say, "No, it comes from cows," and we will talk about the farmer, and the way the milk ends up in the shop.
We will not say, "No, milk is not made in a factory.
" So something strange happened here, and of course these children noticed that.
One boy said, "I asked my parents loads of questions, but they acted really weird.
So, you know, I have a friend at school, and she's made in the same way.
When I have a question, I just go and ask her.
" Clever guy.
Problem solved.
But his parents did not notice, and it certainly was not what they had in mind, nor what the counselor had in mind when they were saying how important it is to be an open-communication family.
And that's the strange thing about advice.
When we offer people pills, we gather evidence first.
We do tests, we do follow-up studies.
We want to know, and rightly so, what this pill is doing and how it affects people's lives.
And advice?
It is not enough for advice, or for professionals to give advice that is theoretically sound, or well-meant.
It should be advice that there is evidence for -- evidence that it actually improves patients' lives.
So the philosopher in me would now like to offer you a paradox: I advise you to stop following advice.
But, yes.
(Applause) I will not end here with what went wrong; I would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families.
Remember the books and the trip to the farmer?
When parents do things that work for them, they do brilliant things. What I want you to remember as members of families, in no matter what form or shape, is that what families need are warm relationships.
And we do not need to be professionals to create those.
Most of us do just fine, although it may be hard work, and from time to time, we can do with some advice. 
In that case, bear in mind three things.
Work with advice that works for your family.
Remember -- you're the expert, because you live your family life.
And finally, believe in your abilities and your creativity, because you can do it yourself. Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi. 
I want to talk about understanding, and the nature of understanding, and what the essence of understanding is, because understanding is something we aim for, everyone.
We want to understand things.
So that is my claim.
And I want to focus on mathematics.
Many of us think of mathematics as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, percent, geometry, algebra -- all that stuff.
But actually, I want to talk about the essence of mathematics as well.
And my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns.
Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern, and this pattern actually emerges just from drawing circles in a very particular way.
So my day-to-day definition of mathematics that I use every day is the following: First of all, it's about finding patterns.
And by "pattern," I mean a connection, a structure, some regularity, some rules that govern what we see.
Second of all, I think it is about representing these patterns with a language.
We make up language if we don't have it, and in mathematics, this is essential.
It's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens.
We're going to do that very soon.
And finally, it's about doing cool stuff.
Mathematics enables us to do so many things.
So let's have a look at these patterns.
If you want to tie a tie knot, there are patterns.
Tie knots have names.
And you can also do the mathematics of tie knots.
This is a left-out, right-in, center-out and tie.
This is a mathematics book about tying shoelaces at the university level, because there are patterns in shoelaces.
You can do it in so many different ways.
We can analyze it.
We can make up languages for it.
And representations are all over mathematics.
This is Leibniz's notation from 1675. He invented a language for patterns in nature.
When we throw something up in the air, it falls down.
Why?
We're not sure, but we can represent this with mathematics in a pattern.
This is also a pattern.
This is also an invented language.
Can you guess for what?
It is actually a notation system for dancing, for tap dancing.
That enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff, to do new things, because he has represented it.
I want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is.
Here it says the word "mathematics.
" But actually, they're just dots, right?
So how in the world can these dots represent the word?
Well, they do.
(Beeps) Somehow these sounds represent the word and the concept.
How does this happen?
There's something amazing going on about representing stuff.
So I want to talk about that magic that happens when we actually represent something.
Here you see just lines with different widths.
They stand for numbers for a particular book.
And I can actually recommend this book, it's a very nice book.
(Laughter) Just trust me.
OK, so let's just do an experiment, just to play around with some straight lines.
This is a straight line.
Let's make another one.
So every time we move, we move one down and one across, and we draw a new straight line, right?
We do this over and over and over, and we look for patterns.
So this pattern emerges, and it's a rather nice pattern.
It looks like a curve, right?
Just from drawing simple, straight lines.
Now I can change my perspective a little bit. 
I can rotate it. Have a look at the curve.
What does it look like?
Is it a part of a circle?
It's actually not a part of a circle.
So I have to continue my investigation and look for the true pattern.
Perhaps if I copy it and make some art?
Well, no.
Perhaps I should extend the lines like this, and look for the pattern there.
Let's make more lines.
We do this. And then let's zoom out and change our perspective again.
Then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola.
This is represented by a simple equation, and it's a beautiful pattern.
So this is the stuff that we do.
We find patterns, and we represent them.
And I think this is a nice day-to-day definition.
But today I want to go a little bit deeper, and think about what the nature of this is.
What makes it possible?
There's one thing that's a little bit deeper, and that has to do with the ability to change your perspective.
And I claim that when you change your perspective, and if you take another point of view, you learn something new about what you are watching or looking at or hearing.
And I think this is a really important thing that we do all the time.
So let's just look at this simple equation, x + x = 2 • x. This is a very nice pattern, and it's true, because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc.
We've seen this over and over, and we represent it like this.
But think about it: this is an equation.
It says that something is equal to something else, and that's two different perspectives.
One perspective is, it's a sum.
It's something you plus together.
On the other hand, it's a multiplication, and those are two different perspectives.
And I would go as far as to say that every equation is like this, every mathematical equation where you use that equality sign is actually a metaphor.
It's an analogy between two things.
You're just viewing something and taking two different points of view, and you're expressing that in a language.
Have a look at this equation.
This is one of the most beautiful equations.
It simply says that, well, two things, they're both -1. This thing on the left-hand side is -1, and the other one is.
And that, I think, is one of the essential parts of mathematics -- you take different points of view.
So let's just play around.
Let's take a number.
We know four-thirds.
We know what four-thirds is.
It's 1.333, but we have to have those three dots, otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds.
But this is only in base 10. 
You know, the number system, we use 10 digits.
If we change that around and only use two digits, that's called the binary system.
It's written like this.
So we're now talking about the number.
The number is four-thirds.
We can write it like this, and we can change the base, change the number of digits, and we can write it differently.
So these are all representations of the same number.
We can even write it simply, like 1.3 or 1.6. 
It all depends on how many digits you have.
Or perhaps we just simplify and write it like this.
I like this one, because this says four divided by three.
And this number expresses a relation between two numbers.
You have four on the one hand and three on the other.
And you can visualize this in many ways.
What I'm doing now is viewing that number from different perspectives.
I'm playing around.
I'm playing around with how we view something, and I'm doing it very deliberately.
We can take a grid.
If it's four across and three up, this line equals five, always.
It has to be like this.
This is a beautiful pattern.
Four and three and five.
And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3, you've seen a lot of times.
This is your average computer screen.
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200 is a television or a computer screen.
So these are all nice representations, but I want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number.
Here you see two circles.
I'm going to rotate them like this.
Observe the upper-left one.
It goes a little bit faster, right?
You can see this.
It actually goes exactly four-thirds as fast.
That means that when it goes around four times, the other one goes around three times.
Now let's make two lines, and draw this dot where the lines meet.
We get this dot dancing around.
(Laughter) And this dot comes from that number.
Right?
Now we should trace it.
Let's trace it and see what happens.
This is what mathematics is all about.
It's about seeing what happens.
And this emerges from four-thirds.
I like to say that this is the image of four-thirds.
It's much nicer -- (Cheers) Thank you!
(Applause) This is not new.
This has been known for a long time, but -- (Laughter) But this is four-thirds.
Let's do another experiment.
Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep) This is a perfect A, 440Hz.
Let's multiply it by two.
We get this sound.
(Beep) When we play them together, it sounds like this.
This is an octave, right?
We can do this game.
We can play a sound, play the same A.
We can multiply it by three-halves.
(Beep) This is what we call a perfect fifth.
(Beep) They sound really nice together.
Let's multiply this sound by four-thirds.
(Beep) What happens?
They sound like this together.
(Beeps) This is the sound of four-thirds.
What I'm doing now, I'm changing my perspective.
I'm just viewing a number from another perspective.
I can even do this with rhythms, right?
I can take a rhythm and play three beats at one time (Drumbeats) in a period of time, and I can play another sound four times in that same space.
(Clanking sounds) Sounds kind of boring, but listen to them together.
(Drumbeats and clanking sounds) (Laughter) Hey! So. (Laughter) I can even make a little hi-hat.
(Drumbeats and cymbals) Can you hear this?
So, this is the sound of four-thirds.
Again, this is as a rhythm.
(Drumbeats and cowbell) And I can keep doing this and play games with this number.
Four-thirds is a really great number. 
I love four-thirds!
(Laughter) Truly -- it's an undervalued number.
So if you take a sphere and look at the volume of the sphere, it's actually four-thirds of some particular cylinder.
So four-thirds is in the sphere.
It's the volume of the sphere.
OK, so why am I doing all this?
Well, I want to talk about what it means to understand something and what we mean by understanding something.
That's my aim here.
And my claim is that you understand something if you have the ability to view it from different perspectives.
Let's look at this letter.
It's a beautiful R, right?
How do you know that?
Well, as a matter of fact, you've seen a bunch of R's, and you've generalized and abstracted all of these and found a pattern.
So you know that this is an R.
So what I'm aiming for here is saying something about how understanding and changing your perspective are linked.
And I'm a teacher and a lecturer, and I can actually use this to teach something, because when I give someone else another story, a metaphor, an analogy, if I tell a story from a different point of view, I enable understanding.
I make understanding possible, because you have to generalize over everything you see and hear, and if I give you another perspective, that will become easier for you.
Let's do a simple example again.
This is four and three.
This is four triangles.
So this is also four-thirds, in a way.
Let's just join them together.
Now we're going to play a game; we're going to fold it up into a three-dimensional structure.
I love this.
This is a square pyramid.
And let's just take two of them and put them together.
So this is what is called an octahedron.
It's one of the five platonic solids.
Now we can quite literally change our perspective, because we can rotate it around all of the axes and view it from different perspectives.
And I can change the axis, and then I can view it from another point of view, but it's the same thing, but it looks a little different.
I can do it even one more time.
Every time I do this, something else appears, so I'm actually learning more about the object when I change my perspective.
I can use this as a tool for creating understanding.
I can take two of these and put them together like this and see what happens.
And it looks a little bit like the octahedron.
Have a look at it if I spin it around like this. 
What happens?
Well, if you take two of these, join them together and spin it around, there's your octahedron again, a beautiful structure.
If you lay it out flat on the floor, this is the octahedron.
This is the graph structure of an octahedron.
And I can continue doing this.
You can draw three great circles around the octahedron, and you rotate around, so actually three great circles is related to the octahedron.
And if I take a bicycle pump and just pump it up, you can see that this is also a little bit like the octahedron.
Do you see what I'm doing here?
I am changing the perspective every time.
So let's now take a step back -- and that's actually a metaphor, stepping back -- and have a look at what we're doing.
I'm playing around with metaphors.
I'm playing around with perspectives and analogies.
I'm telling one story in different ways.
I'm telling stories.
I'm making a narrative; I'm making several narratives.
And I think all of these things make understanding possible.
I think this actually is the essence of understanding something.
I truly believe this.
So this thing about changing your perspective -- it's absolutely fundamental for humans.
Let's play around with the Earth.
Let's zoom into the ocean, have a look at the ocean.
We can do this with anything.
We can take the ocean and view it up close.
We can look at the waves.
We can go to the beach.
We can view the ocean from another perspective.
Every time we do this, we learn a little bit more about the ocean.
If we go to the shore, we can kind of smell it, right?
We can hear the sound of the waves.
We can feel salt on our tongues.
So all of these are different perspectives.
And this is the best one.
We can go into the water.
We can see the water from the inside.
And you know what?
This is absolutely essential in mathematics and computer science.
If you're able to view a structure from the inside, then you really learn something about it.
That's somehow the essence of something.
So when we do this, and we've taken this journey into the ocean, we use our imagination.
And I think this is one level deeper, and it's actually a requirement for changing your perspective.
We can do a little game.
You can imagine that you're sitting there.
You can imagine that you're up here, and that you're sitting here.
You can view yourselves from the outside.
That's really a strange thing.
You're changing your perspective.
You're using your imagination, and you're viewing yourself from the outside.
That requires imagination.
Mathematics and computer science are the most imaginative art forms ever.
And this thing about changing perspectives should sound a little bit familiar to you, because we do it every day.
And then it's called empathy.
When I view the world from your perspective, I have empathy with you.
If I really, truly understand what the world looks like from your perspective, I am empathetic.
That requires imagination.
And that is how we obtain understanding.
And this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science, and there's a really deep connection between empathy and these sciences.
So my conclusion is the following: understanding something really deeply has to do with the ability to change your perspective.
So my advice to you is: try to change your perspective.
You can study mathematics.
It's a wonderful way to train your brain.
Changing your perspective makes your mind more flexible.
It makes you open to new things, and it makes you able to understand things.
And to use yet another metaphor: have a mind like water.
That's nice.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to start by doing an experiment.
I'm going to play three videos of a rainy day.
But I've replaced the audio of one of the videos, and instead of the sound of rain, I've added the sound of bacon frying.
So I want you think carefully which one the clip with the bacon is.
(Rain falls) (Rain falls) (Rain falls) All right. Actually, I lied.
They're all bacon.
(Bacon sizzles) (Applause) My point here isn't really to make you hungry every time you see a rainy scene, but it's to show that our brains are conditioned to embrace the lies. We're not looking for accuracy.
So on the subject of deception, I wanted to quote one of my favorite authors. 
In "The Decay of Lying," Oscar Wilde establishes the idea that all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic; and all great art comes from lying and deceiving, and telling beautiful, untrue things.
So when you're watching a movie and a phone rings, it's not actually ringing. 
It's been added later in postproduction in a studio.
All of the sounds you hear are fake. Everything, apart from the dialogue, is fake.
When you watch a movie and you see a bird flapping its wings -- (Wings flap) They haven't really recorded the bird.
(Punch) That's often done by sticking a knife in vegetables, usually cabbage.(Cabbage stabbed with a knife) The next one -- it's breaking bones.(Bones break) Well, no one was really harmed.It's actually . . . breaking celery or frozen lettuce.
(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery) (Laughter) Making the right sounds is not always as easy as a trip to the supermarket and going to the vegetable section.
But it's often a lot more complicated than that.
So let's reverse-engineer together the creation of a sound effect.
One of my favorite stories comes from Frank Serafine. 
He's a contributor to our library, and a great sound designer for "Tron" and "Star Trek" and others.
He was part of the Paramount team that won the Oscar for best sound for "The Hunt for Red October. 
" In this Cold War classic, in the '90s, they were asked to produce the sound of the propeller of the submarine.
So they had a small problem: they couldn't really find a submarine in West Hollywood.
So basically, what they did is, they went to a friend's swimming pool, and Frank performed a cannonball, or bomba.
(Water splashes at lower octave) And then they removed a lot of the high frequencies.
(Water splashes) And pitched it down another octave. (Water splashes at lower octave) And then they added a little bit of the splash from the overhead microphone.
(Water splashes) And by looping and repeating that sound, they got this: (Propeller churns) So, creativity and technology put together in order to create the illusion that we're inside the submarine.
But once you've created your sounds and you've synced them to the image, you want those sounds to live in the world of the story.
And one the best ways to do that is to add reverb. So this is the first audio tool I want to talk about.
Reverberation, or reverb, is the persistence of the sound after the original sound has ended.
So it's sort of like the -- all the reflections from the materials, the objects and the walls around the sound.
Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.
The original sound is less than half a second long.
(Gunshot) By adding reverb, we can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom.
(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom) Or like it was recorded inside a chapel or a church.
(Gunshot reverbs church) Or in a canyon.
(Gunshot reverbs in canyon) So reverb gives us a lot of information about the space between the listener and the original sound source.
If the sound is the taste, then reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound.
But reverb can do a lot more.
Listening to a sound with a lot less reverberation than the on-screen action is going to immediately signify to us that we're listening to a commentator, to an objective narrator that's not participating in the on-screen action.
Also, emotionally intimate moments in cinema are often heard with zero reverb, because that's how it would sound if someone was speaking inside our ear.
On the completely other side, adding a lot of reverb to a voice is going to make us think that we're listening to a flashback, or perhaps that we're inside the head of a character or that we're listening to the voice of God.
Or, even more powerful in film, Morgan Freeman. (Laughter) So -- (Applause) But what are some other tools or hacks that sound designers use? Well, here's a really big one.
It's silence.
A few moments of silence is going to make us pay attention.
And in the Western world, we're not really used to verbal silences.
They're considered awkward or rude.
So silence preceding verbal communication can create a lot of tension.
But imagine a really big Hollywood movie, where it's full of explosions and automatic guns.
Loud stops being loud anymore, after a while.
So in a yin-yang way, silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence for either of them to have any effect.
But what does silence mean?
Well, it depends how it's used in each film.
Silence can place us inside the head of a character or provoke thought.
We often relate silences with . . . contemplation, meditation, being deep in thought.
But apart from having one meaning, silence becomes a blank canvas upon which the viewer is invited to the paint their own thoughts.
But I want to make it clear: there is no such thing as silence.
And I know this sounds like the most pretentious TED Talk statement ever.
But even if you were to enter a room with zero reverberation and zero external sounds, you would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood.
And in cinema, traditionally, there was never a silent moment because of the sound of the projector.
And even in today's Dolby world, there's not really any moment of silence if you listen around you.
There's always some sort of noise.
Now, since there's no such thing as silence, what do filmmakers and sound designers use?
Well, as a synonym, they often use ambiences.
Ambiences are the unique background sounds that are specific to each location.
Each location has a unique sound, and each room has a unique sound, which is called room tone.
(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler, the fridge and street traffic) Ambiences work in a most primal way.
They can speak directly to our brain subconsciously.
So, birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality, perhaps because, as a species, we've been used to that sound every morning for millions of years. (Birds chirp) On the other hand, industrial sounds have been introduced to us a little more recently.
Even though I really like them personally -- they've been used by one of my heroes, David Lynch, and his sound designer, Alan Splet -- industrial sounds often carry negative connotations.
(Machine noises) Now, sound effects can tap into our emotional memory.
Occasionally, they can be so significant that they become a character in a movie. The sound of thunder may indicate divine intervention or anger.
(Thunder) Church bells can remind us of the passing of time, or perhaps our own mortality.
(Bells ring) And breaking of glass can indicate the end of a relationship or a friendship.
(Glass breaks) Scientists believe that dissonant sounds, for example, brass or wind instruments played very loud, may remind us of animal howls in nature and therefore create a sense of irritation or fear.
(Brass and wind instruments play) So now we've spoken about on-screen sounds.
But occasionally, the source of a sound cannot be seen.
That's what we call offscreen sounds, or "acousmatic.
" Acousmatic sounds -- well, the term "acousmatic" comes from Pythagoras in ancient Greece, who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years, not revealing himself to his disciples.
There's a strong tradition of acousmatic sound.
Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice used to sing in rooms up in galleries close to the ceiling, creating the illusion that we're listening to angels up in the sky.
Richard Wagner famously created the hidden orchestra that was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience.
And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin, famously hid in dark corners of clubs.
I think what all these masters knew is that by hiding the source, you create a sense of mystery.
This has been seen in cinema over and over, with Hitchcock, and Ridley Scott in "Alien.
" Hearing a sound without knowing its source is going to create some sort of tension.
Also, it can minimize certain visual restrictions that directors have and can show something that wasn't there during filming.
And if all this sounds a little theoretical, I wanted to play a little video.
(Toy squeaks) (Typewriter) (Drums) (Ping-pong) (Knives being sharpened) (Record scratches) (Saw cuts) (Woman screams) What I'm sort of trying to demonstrate with these tools is that sound is a language.
It can trick us by transporting us geographically; it can change the mood; it can set the pace; it can make us laugh or it can make us scared.
On a personal level, I fell in love with that language a few years ago, and somehow managed to make it into some sort of profession. And I think with our work through the sound library, we're trying to kind of expand the vocabulary of that language.
And in that way, we want to offer the right tools to sound designers, filmmakers, and video game and app designers, to keep telling even better stories and creating even more beautiful lies.
So thanks for listening.
(Applause)I want to start by doing an experiment.
I'm going to play three videos of a rainy day.
But I've replaced the audio of one of the videos, and instead of the sound of rain, I've added the sound of bacon frying.

So thanks for listening.
(Applause)
I'm a painter.
I make large-scale figurative paintings, which means I paint people like this.
But I'm here tonight to tell you about something personal that changed my work and my perspective.
It's something we all go through, and my hope is that my experience may be helpful to somebody.
To give you some background on me, I grew up the youngest of eight.
Yes, eight kids in my family.
I have six older brothers and a sister.
To give you a sense of what that's like, when my family went on vacation, we had a bus.
(Laughter) My supermom would drive us all over town to our various after-school activities -- not in the bus.
We had a regular car, too.
She would take me to art classes, and not just one or two.
She took me to every available art class from when I was eight to 16, because that's all I wanted to do.
She even took a class with me in New York City.
Now, being the youngest of eight, I learned a few survival skills.
Rule number one: don't let your big brother see you do anything stupid.
So I learned to be quiet and neat and careful to follow the rules and stay in line.
But painting was where I made the rules.
That was my private world.
By 14, I knew I really wanted to be an artist.
My big plan was to be a waitress to support my painting. So I continued honing my skills.
I went to graduate school and I got an MFA, and at my first solo show, my brother asked me, "What do all these red dots mean next to the paintings?
" Nobody was more surprised than me.
The red dots meant that the paintings were sold and that I'd be able to pay my rent with painting.
Now, my apartment had four electrical outlets, and I couldn't use a microwave and a toaster at the same time, but still, I could pay my rent.
So I was very happy.
Here's a painting from back around that time.
I needed it to be as realistic as possible.
It had to be specific and believable.
This was the place where I was isolated and in total control.
Since then, I've made a career of painting people in water.
Bathtubs and showers were the perfect enclosed environment.
It was intimate and private, and water was this complicated challenge that kept me busy for a decade.
I made about 200 of these paintings, some of them six to eight feet, like this one.
For this painting, I mixed flour in with the bathwater to make it cloudy and I floated cooking oil on the surface and stuck a girl in it, and when I lit it up, it was so beautiful I couldn't wait to paint it.
I was driven by this kind of impulsive curiosity, always looking for something new to add: vinyl, steam, glass.
I once put all this Vaseline in my head and hair just to see what that would look like.
Don't do that.
(Laughter) So it was going well.
I was finding my way.
I was eager and motivated and surrounded by artists, always going to openings and events.
I was having some success and recognition and I moved into an apartment with more than four outlets.
My mom and I would stay up very late talking about our latest ideas and inspiring each other.
She made beautiful pottery.
I have a friend named Bo who made this painting of his wife and I dancing by the ocean, and he called it "The Light Years.
" I asked him what that meant, and he said, "Well, that's when you've stepped into adulthood, you're no longer a child, but you're not yet weighed down by the responsibilities of life.
" That was it. It was the light years.
On October 8, 2011, the light years came to an end.
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.
It had spread to her bones, and it was in her brain.
When she told me this, I fell to my knees.
I totally lost it.
And when I got myself together and I looked at her, I realized, this isn't about me.
This is about figuring out how to help her.
My father is a doctor, and so we had a great advantage having him in charge, and he did a beautiful job taking care of her.
But I, too, wanted to do everything I could to help, so I wanted to try everything.
We all did.
I researched alternative medicines, diets, juicing, acupuncture.
Finally, I asked her, "Is this what you want me to do?
" And she said, "No.
" She said, "Pace yourself.
I'm going to need you later.
" She knew what was happening, and she knew what the doctors and the experts and the internet didn't know: how she wanted to go through this.
I just needed to ask her. I realized that if I tried to fix it, I would miss it.
So I just started to be with her, whatever that meant and whatever situation came up, just really listen to her.
If before I was resisting, then now I was surrendering, giving up trying to control the uncontrollable and just being there in it with her.
Time slowed down, and the date was irrelevant.
We developed a routine.
Early each morning I would crawl into bed with her and sleep with her.
My brother would come for breakfast and we'd be so glad to hear his car coming up the driveway.
So I'd help her up and take both her hands and help her walk to the kitchen.
She had this huge mug she made she loved to drink her coffee out of, and she loved Irish soda bread for breakfast.
We had warm towels and slippers ready immediately so she never got cold for a second.
I'd blow-dry her hair.
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair, and she didn't want to eat so much, and she used the tiniest little teacup we could find to drink her coffee.
I couldn't support her myself anymore, so we hired an aide to help me with the showers.
We called this time "the beautiful awful.
" She died on October 26, 2012. 
It was a year and three weeks after her diagnosis.
She was gone.
This was the most important thing.
So I packed up my car and I drove back to Brooklyn, and painting is what I've always done, so that's what I did.
It's like a release of everything that was unraveling in me.
It didn't matter. 
It didn't matter.
So here's what I learned. We're all going to have big losses in our lives, maybe a job or a career, relationships, love, our youth.
These kinds of losses are out of our control.
She took me to every available art class from when I was eight to 16, because that's all I wanted to do.
She even took a class with me in New York City.
Now, being the youngest of eight, I learned a few survival skills.
I went to graduate school and I got an MFA, and at my first solo show, my brother asked me, "What do all these red dots mean next to the paintings?
I needed it to be as realistic as possible.
It was intimate and private, and water was this complicated challenge that kept me busy for a decade.
I made about 200 of these paintings, some of them six to eight feet, like this one.
For this painting, I mixed flour in with the bathwater to make it cloudy and I floated cooking oil on the surface and stuck a girl in it, and when I lit it up, it was so beautiful I couldn't wait to paint it.
I was driven by this kind of impulsive curiosity, always looking for something new to add: vinyl, steam, glass.
I once put all this Vaseline in my head and hair just to see what that would look like.
Don't do that.
(Laughter) So it was going well.
I was finding my way.
I was eager and motivated and surrounded by artists, always going to openings and events.
I was having some success and recognition and I moved into an apartment with more than four outlets.
My mom and I would stay up very late talking about our latest ideas and inspiring each other.
She made beautiful pottery.
I have a friend named Bo who made this painting of his wife and I dancing by the ocean, and he called it "The Light Years.
" I asked him what that meant, and he said, "Well, that's when you've stepped into adulthood, you're no longer a child, but you're not yet weighed down by the responsibilities of life.
" That was it. 
It was the light years.
On October 8, 2011, the light years came to an end.
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.
It had spread to her bones, and it was in her brain.
When she told me this, I fell to my knees.
I totally lost it.
And when I got myself together and I looked at her, I realized, this isn't about me.
This is about figuring out how to help her.
My father is a doctor, and so we had a great advantage having him in charge, and he did a beautiful job taking care of her.
But I, too, wanted to do everything I could to help, so I wanted to try everything.
We all did.
I researched alternative medicines, diets, juicing, acupuncture.
Finally, I asked her, "Is this what you want me to do?
" And she said, "No.
" She said, "Pace yourself.
I'm going to need you later.
" She knew what was happening, and she knew what the doctors and the experts and the internet didn't know: how she wanted to go through this.
I just needed to ask her. 
I realized that if I tried to fix it, I would miss it.
So I just started to be with her, whatever that meant and whatever situation came up, just really listen to her.
If before I was resisting, then now I was surrendering, giving up trying to control the uncontrollable and just being there in it with her.
Time slowed down, and the date was irrelevant.
We developed a routine.
Early each morning I would crawl into bed with her and sleep with her.
My brother would come for breakfast and we'd be so glad to hear his car coming up the driveway.
So I'd help her up and take both her hands and help her walk to the kitchen.
She had this huge mug she made she loved to drink her coffee out of, and she loved Irish soda bread for breakfast.
Afterwards was the shower, and she loved this part.
She loved the warm water, so I made this as indulgent as I could, like a spa.
My sister would help sometimes.
We had warm towels and slippers ready immediately so she never got cold for a second.
I'd blow-dry her hair.
My brothers would come in the evenings and bring their kids, and that was the highlight of her day.
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair, and she didn't want to eat so much, and she used the tiniest little teacup we could find to drink her coffee.
I couldn't support her myself anymore, so we hired an aide to help me with the showers.
These simple daily activities became our sacred ritual, and we repeated them day after day as the cancer grew.
It was humbling and painful and exactly where I wanted to be.
We called this time "the beautiful awful.
" She died on October 26, 2012. It was a year and three weeks after her diagnosis.
She was gone.
My brothers, sister, and father and I all came together in this supportive and attentive way.
It was as though our whole family dynamic and all our established roles vanished and we were just all together in this unknown, feeling the same thing and taking care of each other.
I'm so grateful for them.
As someone who spends most of my time alone in a studio working, I had no idea that this kind of connection could be so important, so healing.
This was the most important thing.
It was what I always wanted.
So after the funeral, it was time for me to go back to my studio.
So I packed up my car and I drove back to Brooklyn, and painting is what I've always done, so that's what I did.
And here's what happened.
It's like a release of everything that was unraveling in me.
That safe, very, very carefully rendered safe place that I created in all my other paintings, it was a myth. It didn't work.
And I was afraid, because I didn't want to paint anymore.
So I went into the woods.
I thought, I'll try that, going outside. I got my paints, and I wasn't a landscape painter, but I wasn't really much of any kind of painter at all, so I had no attachment, no expectation, which allowed me to be reckless and free.
I actually left one of these wet paintings outside overnight next to a light in the woods.
By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.
But I didn't care.
It didn't matter. It didn't matter.
I took all these paintings back to my studio, and scraped them, and carved into them, and poured paint thinner on them, put more paint on top, drew on them. 
I had no plan, but I was watching what was happening.
This is the one with all the bugs in it.
I wasn't trying to represent a real space.
It was the chaos and the imperfections that were fascinating me, and something started to happen.
I got curious again.
This is another one from the woods.
There was a caveat now, though. 
I couldn't be controlling the paint like I used to.
It had to be about implying and suggesting, not explaining or describing.
And that imperfect, chaotic, turbulent surface is what told the story.
I started to be as curious as I was when I was a student.
So the next thing was I wanted to put figures in these paintings, people, and I loved this new environment, so I wanted to have both people and this atmosphere.
When the idea hit me of how to do this, I got kind of nauseous and dizzy, which is really just adrenaline, probably, but for me it's a really good sign.
And so now I want to show you what I've been working on.
It's something I haven't shown yet, and it's like a preview, I guess, of my upcoming show, what I have so far.
Expansive space instead of the isolated bathtub.
I'm going outside instead of inside.
Loosening control, savoring the imperfections, allowing the -- allowing the imperfections.
And in that imperfection, you can find a vulnerability.
I could feel my deepest intention, what matters most to me, that human connection that can happen in a space where there's no resisting or controlling.
I want to make paintings about that.
So here's what I learned. We're all going to have big losses in our lives, maybe a job or a career, relationships, love, our youth.
We're going to lose our health, people we love.
These kinds of losses are out of our control.
They're unpredictable, and they bring us to our knees.
And so I say, let them.
Fall to your knees. Be humbled.
Let go of trying to change it or even wanting it to be different.
It just is.
And then there's space, and in that space feel your vulnerability, what matters most to you, your deepest intention.
And be curious to connect to what and who is really here, awake and alive.
It's what we all want.
Let's take the opportunity to find something beautiful in the unknown, in the unpredictable, and even in the awful.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When you come to TEDx, you always think about technology, the world changing, becoming more innovative.
You think about the driverless. Everyone's talking about driverless cars these days, and I love the concept of a driverless car, but when I go in one, you know, I want it really slow, I want access to the steering wheel and the brake, just in case.
I don't know about you, but I am not ready for a driverless bus.
I am not ready for a driverless airplane.
How about a driverless world?
And I ask you that because we are increasingly in one.
It's not supposed to be that way.
We're number one, the United States is large and in charge.
Americanization and globalization for the last several generations have basically been the same thing.
Right?
Whether it's the World Trade Organization or it's the IMF, the World Bank, the Bretton Woods Accord on currency, these were American institutions, our values, our friends, our allies, our money, our standards.
That was the way the world worked.
So it's sort of interesting, if you want to look at how the US looks, here it is.
This is our view of how the world is run.
President Obama has got the red carpet, he goes down Air Force One, and it feels pretty good, it feels pretty comfortable.
Well, I don't know how many of you saw the China trip last week and the G20. Oh my God.
Right?
This is how we landed for the most important meeting of the world's leaders in China.
The National Security Advisor was actually spewing expletives on the tarmac -- no red carpet, kind of left out the bottom of the plane along with all the media and everybody else.
Later on in the G20, well, there's Obama.
(Laughter) Hi, George. Hi, Norman.
They look like they're about to get into a cage match, right?
And they did.
It was 90 minutes long, and they talked about Syria.
That's what Putin wanted to talk about.
He's increasingly calling the shots.
He's the one willing to do stuff there.
There's not a lot of mutual like or trust, but it's not as if the Americans are telling him what to do.
How about when the whole 20 are getting together?
Angela Merkel has -- she always does -- that look, she always does that.
But Putin is telling Turkish president Erdogan what to do, and Obama is like, what's going on over there?
You see.
And the problem is it's not a G20, the problem is it's a G-Zero world that we live in, a world order where there is no single country or alliance that can meet the challenges of global leadership.
So globalization is continuing.
Goods and services and people and capital are moving across borders faster and faster than ever before, but Americanization is not.
I want to talk about the implications of that for the whole world.
And then I want to talk about what we think right here in the United States and in New York.
Why are we here?
We don't want to do that anymore.
The Americans don't want to even be the cheerleader of global values.
Well, then you look to Europe, and the most important alliance in the world has been the transatlantic relationship.
But it is now weaker than it has been at any point since World War II, all of the crises, the Brexit conversations, the hedging going on between the French and the Russians, or the Germans and the Turks, or the Brits and the Chinese.
They want their own preferences and order.
(Laughter) You know, I left a little out, but you get the general idea.
There's no question he's hitting above his weight.
But long term -- I didn't mean that.
Those are the three most important economies in Asia.
We see that Kim Jong Un, just in the last couple of days, tested yet another nuclear weapon.
But the leaders in Asia do not feel the need to wave the flag, to go xenophobic, to actually allow escalation of the geopolitical and cross-border tensions.
So much of what is happening in the Middle East is washing up quite literally onto European shores.
There you could actually see a slip away from the United States over the coming years.
Are we prepared to truly lead by example?
A depression would do that.
Through our cell phones, individually, we have those voices to compel them to change.
(Applause)When you come to TEDx, you always think about technology, the world changing, becoming more innovative.
You think about the driverless. Everyone's talking about driverless cars these days, and I love the concept of a driverless car, but when I go in one, you know, I want it really slow, I want access to the steering wheel and the brake, just in case.
I don't know about you, but I am not ready for a driverless bus.
I am not ready for a driverless airplane.
How about a driverless world?
And I ask you that because we are increasingly in one.
It's not supposed to be that way.
We're number one, the United States is large and in charge.
Americanization and globalization for the last several generations have basically been the same thing.
Right?
Whether it's the World Trade Organization or it's the IMF, the World Bank, the Bretton Woods Accord on currency, these were American institutions, our values, our friends, our allies, our money, our standards.

So it's sort of interesting, if you want to look at how the US looks, here it is.

That's what Putin wanted to talk about.
He's increasingly calling the shots.
He's the one willing to do stuff there.
There's not a lot of mutual like or trust, but it's not as if the Americans are telling him what to do.
How about when the whole 20 are getting together?
Surely, when the leaders are all onstage, then the Americans are pulling their weight. Uh-oh. (Laughter) Xi Jinping seems fine.
Angela Merkel has -- she always does -- that look, she always does that.
But Putin is telling Turkish president Erdogan what to do, and Obama is like, what's going on over there?
You see.
And the problem is it's not a G20, the problem is it's a G-Zero world that we live in, a world order where there is no single country or alliance that can meet the challenges of global leadership.
The G20 doesn't work, the G7, all of our friends, that's history.
So globalization is continuing.
Goods and services and people and capital are moving across borders faster and faster than ever before, but Americanization is not.
So if I've convinced you of that, I want to do two things with the rest of this talk.
I want to talk about the implications of that for the whole world.
I'll go around it.
And then I want to talk about what we think right here in the United States and in New York.
So why? What are the implications.
Why are we here?
Well, we're here because the United States, we spent two trillion dollars on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that were failed.
We don't want to do that anymore.
We have large numbers of middle and working classes that feel like they've not benefited from promises of globalization, so they don't want to see it particularly.
And we have an energy revolution where we don't need OPEC or the Middle East the way we used to.
We produce all that right here in the United States.
So the Americans don't want to be the global sheriff for security or the architect of global trade.
The Americans don't want to even be the cheerleader of global values.
Well, then you look to Europe, and the most important alliance in the world has been the transatlantic relationship.
But it is now weaker than it has been at any point since World War II, all of the crises, the Brexit conversations, the hedging going on between the French and the Russians, or the Germans and the Turks, or the Brits and the Chinese.
China does want to do more leadership.
They do, but only in the economic sphere, and they want their own values, standards, currency, in competition with that of the US.
The Russians want to do more leadership.
You see that in Ukraine, in the Baltic states, in the Middle East, but not with the Americans.
They want their own preferences and order.
That's why we are where we are.
So what happens going forward?
Let's start easy, with the Middle East.
(Laughter) You know, I left a little out, but you get the general idea.
Look, there are three reasons why the Middle East has had stability such as it is.
Right?
One is because there was a willingness to provide some level of military security by the US and allies.
Number two, it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground because oil was expensive.
And number three was no matter how bad the leaders were, the populations were relatively quiescent.
They didn't have the ability, and many didn't have the will to really rise up against.
Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world, all three of those things are increasingly not true, and so failed states, terrorism, refugees and the rest.
Does the entire Middle East fall apart?
No, the Kurds will do better, and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.
But generally speaking, it's not a good look.
OK, how about this guy?
He's playing a poor hand very well.
There's no question he's hitting above his weight.
But long term -- I didn't mean that.
The Chinese are going to dominate it.
The Russians are picking up the crumbs.
In a G-Zero world, this is going to be a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin. It's not all bad.
Right?
Asia actually looks a lot better.
There are real leaders across Asia, they have a lot of political stability.
They're there for a while. Mr. Modi in India, Mr.
Abe, who is probably about to get a third term written in in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, of course Xi Jinping who is consolidating enormous power, the most powerful leader in China since Mao.
Those are the three most important economies in Asia.
Now look, there are problems in Asia.
We see the sparring over the South China Sea.
We see that Kim Jong Un, just in the last couple of days, tested yet another nuclear weapon.
But the leaders in Asia do not feel the need to wave the flag, to go xenophobic, to actually allow escalation of the geopolitical and cross-border tensions.
They want to focus on long-term economic stability and growth.
And that's what they're actually doing.
Let's turn to Europe.
Europe does look a little scared in this environment.
So much of what is happening in the Middle East is washing up quite literally onto European shores.
You see Brexit and you see the concerns of populism across all of the European states.
Let me tell you that over the long term, in a G-Zero world, European expansion will be seen to have gone too far.
So Europe was able to truly expand under the G7, but under the G-Zero, Europe will get smaller.
Core Europe around Germany and France and others will still work, be functional, stable, wealthy, integrated.
But the periphery, countries like Greece and Turkey and others, will not look that good at all.
Latin America, a lot of populism, made the economies not go so well.
They had been more opposed to the United States for decades.
Increasingly, they're coming back.
We see that in Argentina.
We see it with the openness in Cuba.
We will see it in Venezuela when Maduro falls.
We will see it in Brazil after the impeachment and when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there.
The only place you see that is moving in another direction is the unpopularity of Mexican president Peña Nieto.
There you could actually see a slip away from the United States over the coming years.
The US election matters a lot on that one, too.
(Laughter) Africa, right?
A lot of people have said it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.
In a G-Zero world, it is absolutely an amazing time for a few African countries, those governed well with a lot of urbanization, a lot of smart people, women really getting into the workforce, entrepreneurship taking off.
But for most of the countries in Africa, it's going to be a lot more dicey: extreme climate conditions, radicalism both from Islam and also Christianity, very poor governance, borders you can't defend, lots of forced migration.
Those countries can fall off the map.
So you're really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the winners and the losers across Africa.
Finally, back to the United States.
What do I think about us?
Because there are a lot of upset people, not here at TEDx, I know, but in the United States, my God, after 15 months of campaigning, we should be upset.
I understand that.
But a lot of people are upset because they say, "Washington's broken, we don't trust the establishment, we hate the media.
" Heck, even globalists like me are taking it on the chin.
Look, I do think we have to recognize, my fellow campers, that when you are being chased by the bear, in the global context, you need not outrun the bear, you need to only outrun your fellow campers.
(Laughter) Now, I just told you about our fellow campers.
Right?
And from that perspective, we look OK.
A lot of people in that context say, "Let's go dollar. Let's go New York real estate.
Let's send our kids to American universities.
" You know, our neighbors are awesome: Canada, Mexico and two big bodies of water.
You know how much Turkey would love to have neighbors like that?
Those are awesome neighbors.
Terrorism is a problem in the United States.
God knows we know it here in New York.
But it's a much bigger problem in Europe than the US.
It's a much bigger problem in the Middle East than it is in Europe.
These are factors of large magnitude.
We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees, and we're complaining bitterly about it.
You know why?
Because they can't swim here.
Right?
I mean, the Turks would love to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.
The Jordanians, the Germans, the Brits. Right?
That's not the situation.
That's the reality of the United States.
Now, that sounds pretty good.
Here's the challenge. In a G-Zero world, the way you lead is by example.
Even when the bear is not chasing us, this is a good place to be.
We want to emulate them. The election process this year is not proving a good option for leading by example.
Hillary Clinton says it's going to be like the '90s.
We can still be that cheerleader on values.
We can still be the architect of global trade.
We can still be the global sheriff.
And Donald Trump wants to bring us back to the '30s.
He's saying, "Our way or the highway. You don't like it, lump it.
" Right?
Neither are recognizing a fundamental truth of the G-Zero, which is that even though the US is not in decline, it is getting objectively harder for the Americans to impose their will, even have great influence, on the global order.
Are we prepared to truly lead by example?
What would we have to do to fix this after November, after the next president comes in?
Well, either we have to have another crisis that forces us to respond.
A depression would do that.
Another global financial crisis could do this.
God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.
Or, absent crisis, we need to see that the hollowing out, the inequality, the challenges that are growing and growing in the United States, are themselves urgent enough to force our leaders to change, and that we have those voices.
Through our cell phones, individually, we have those voices to compel them to change.
There is, of course, a third choice, perhaps the most likely one, which is that we do neither of those things, and in four years time you invite me back, and I will give this speech yet again.
Thank you very, very much.
(Applause)
Struggling to see through the dust and the smoke, you do your best to assist the wounded and then crawl to a nearby bunker.
You give the vision a name, Bloody Face in Bunker, and call it BFIB for short.
You keep BFIB locked away in your mind, secretly haunting you, for the next seven years.
Can you see BFIB?
When I was a little girl, I would visit my grandparents every summer.
But at night I would hear him shouting obscenities from his room down the hall.
And during the day I would announce myself as I entered the room, careful not to startle or agitate him.
Seeking a graduate degree in art therapy, I naturally gravitated towards the study of trauma.
Generation after generation of veterans have chosen not to talk about their experiences, and suffer in solitude.
Art-making accesses the same sensory areas of the brain that encode trauma.
Service members can use the art-making to work through their experiences in a nonthreatening way.
And when service members create these masks, it allows them to come to grips, literally, with their trauma.
And it's amazing how often that enables them to break through the trauma and start to heal.
Every time he paints these disturbing images, he sees them less or not at all.
Now science is showing us that the part of the brain that registers a traumatic wound can be the part of the brain where healing happens too.
It was April, last year.
Now, there are few words to describe the all-consuming feelings of vulnerability, shame, upset and injustice that I was ridden with in that moment and for the weeks to come.
I wrote a letter to my assaulter, humanizing him as "you," to identify him as part of the very community that he had so violently abused that night.
And this is a fight you will not win.
One of the first contributions we had was from a woman called Nikki, who described growing up, being molested my her own father.
And the more we started to receive these messages, the more we also started to receive messages of hope -- people feeling empowered by this community of voices standing up to sexual assault and victim-blaming.
And that's why the story was news.
Worrying, too, is the tendency for some reactions to injustice to build even more walls, being quick to point fingers with the hope of providing easy solutions to complex problems.
You can not speak over those directly affected by an injustice.
Because we might be angry, upset and energized by injustice, but let's consider our responses.
Let us hold people to account, without descending into a culture that thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves.
Let us remember that distinction, so often forgotten by internet users, between criticism and insult.
Let us not forget to think before we speak, just because we might have a screen in front of us.
And when we create noise on social media, let it not drown out the needs of those affected, but instead let it amplify their voices, so the internet becomes a place where you're not the exception if you speak out about something that has actually happened to you.
All these considered approaches to injustice evoke the very keystones on which the internet was built: to network, to have signal, to connect -- all these terms that imply bringing people together, not pushing people apart.
Because if you look up the word "justice" in the dictionary, before punishment, before administration of law or judicial authority, you get: "The maintenance of what is right.
" And I think there are few things more "right" in this world than bringing people together, than unions.
And if we allow social media to deliver that, then it can deliver a very powerful form of justice, indeed.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)It was April, last year.
I was on an evening out with friends to celebrate one of their birthdays.
We hadn't been all together for a couple of weeks; it was a perfect evening, as we were all reunited.
At the end of the evening, I caught the last underground train back to the other side of London.
The journey was smooth.
I got back to my local station and I began the 10-minute walk home.
As I turned the corner onto my street, my house in sight up ahead, I heard footsteps behind me that seemed to have approached out of nowhere and were picking up pace.
With each smack of my head to the concrete ground, a question echoed through my mind that still haunts me today: "Is this going to be how it all ends?
" Little could I have realized, I'd been followed the whole way from the moment I left the station.
And hours later, I was standing topless and barelegged in front of the police, having the cuts and bruises on my naked body photographed for forensic evidence.
Now, there are few words to describe the all-consuming feelings of vulnerability, shame, upset and injustice that I was ridden with in that moment and for the weeks to come.
But wanting to find a way to condense these feelings into something ordered that I could work through, I decided to do what felt most natural to me: I wrote about it.
It started out as a cathartic exercise.
I wrote a letter to my assaulter, humanizing him as "you," to identify him as part of the very community that he had so violently abused that night.
Stressing the tidal-wave effect of his actions, I wrote: "Did you ever think of the people in your life?
I don't know who the people in your life are.
I don't know anything about you.
But I do know this: you did not just attack me that night.
I'm a daughter, I'm a friend, I'm a sister, I'm a pupil, I'm a cousin, I'm a niece, I'm a neighbor; I'm the employee who served everyone coffee in the café under the railway.
And all the people who form these relations to me make up my community.
And you assaulted every single one of them.
You violated the truth that I will never cease to fight for, and which all of these people represent: that there are infinitely more good people in the world than bad.
I told my attacker, "You've carried out your attack, but now I'm getting back on my tube.
My community will not feel we are unsafe walking home after dark.
We will get on the last tubes home, and we will walk up our streets alone, because we will not ingrain or submit to the idea that we are putting ourselves in danger in doing so.
We will continue to come together, like an army, when any member of our community is threatened.
And this is a fight you will not win.
" At the time of writing this letter -- (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) At the time of writing this letter, I was studying for my exams in Oxford, and I was working on the local student paper there.
Despite being lucky enough to have friends and family supporting me, it was an isolating time.
I didn't know anyone who'd been through this before; at least I didn't think I did.
I'd read news reports, statistics, and knew how common sexual assault was, yet I couldn't actually name a single person that I'd heard speak out about an experience of this kind before.
So in a somewhat spontaneous decision, I decided that I would publish my letter in the student paper, hoping to reach out to others in Oxford that might have had a similar experience and be feeling the same way.
Soon, we were receiving hundreds of stories from men and women across the world, which we began to publish on a website I set up.
And the hashtag became a campaign.
There was an Australian mother in her 40s who described how on an evening out, she was followed to the bathroom by a man who went to repeatedly grab her crotch.
There was a man in the Netherlands who described how he was date-raped on a visit to London and wasn't taken seriously by anyone he reported his case to.
I had personal Facebook messages from people in India and South America, saying, how can we bring the message of the campaign there?
One of the first contributions we had was from a woman called Nikki, who described growing up, being molested my her own father.
And I had friends open up to me about experiences ranging from those that happened last week to those that happened years ago, that I'd had no idea about.
And the more we started to receive these messages, the more we also started to receive messages of hope -- people feeling empowered by this community of voices standing up to sexual assault and victim-blaming.
One woman called Olivia, after describing how she was attacked by someone she had trusted and cared about for a long time, said, "I've read many of the stories posted here, and I feel hopeful that if so many women can move forward, then I can, too.
I've been inspired by many, and I hope I can be as strong as them someday.
I'm sure I will.
" People around the world began tweeting under this hashtag, and the letter was republished and covered by the national press, as well as being translated into several other languages worldwide.
But something struck me about the media attention that this letter was attracting.
For something to be front-page news, given the word "news" itself, we can assume it must be something new or something surprising.
And yet sexual assault is not something new.
Sexual assault, along with other kinds of injustices, is reported in the media all the time.
The voices of those directly affected were at the forefront of the story -- not the voices of journalists or commentators on social media.
But it's also made us increasingly reactive, from the smallest annoyances of, "Oh, my train's been delayed," to the greatest injustices of war, genocides, terrorist attacks.
Our default response has become to leap to react to any kind of grievance by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging -- anything to show others that we, too, have reacted.
The problem with reacting in this manner en masse is it can sometimes mean that we don't actually react at all, not in the sense of actually doing anything, anyway.
It might make ourselves feel better, like we've contributed to a group mourning or outrage, but it doesn't actually change anything.
And what's more, it can sometimes drown out the voices of those directly affected by the injustice, whose needs must be heard.
Worrying, too, is the tendency for some reactions to injustice to build even more walls, being quick to point fingers with the hope of providing easy solutions to complex problems.
One British tabloid, on the publication of my letter, branded a headline stating, "Oxford Student Launches Online Campaign to Shame Attacker.
" But the campaign never meant to shame anyone. 
It meant to let people speak and to make others listen.
Divisive Twitter trolls were quick to create even more injustice, commenting on my attacker's ethnicity or class to push their own prejudiced agendas.
And some even accused me of feigning the whole thing to push, and I quote, my "feminist agenda of man-hating.
" (Laughter) I know, right?
As if I'm going to be like, "Hey guys! Sorry I can't make it, I'm busy trying to hate the entire male population by the time I'm 30." (Laughter) Now, I'm almost sure that these people wouldn't say the things they say in person.
But it's as if because they might be behind a screen, in the comfort in their own home when on social media, people forget that what they're doing is a public act -- that other people will be reading it and be affected by it.
A couple of months before the campaign started or any of this happened to me, I went to a TEDx event in Oxford, and I saw Zelda la Grange speak, the former private secretary to Nelson Mandela.
One of the stories she told really struck me.
She spoke of when Mandela was taken to court by the South African Rugby Union after he commissioned an inquiry into sports affairs.
In the courtroom, he went up to the South African Rugby Union's lawyers, shook them by the hand and conversed with them, each in their own language.
And Zelda wanted to protest, saying they had no right to his respect after this injustice they had caused him.
He turned to her and said, "You must never allow the enemy to determine the grounds for battle.
" At the time of hearing these words, I didn't really know why they were so important, but I felt they were, and I wrote them down in a notebook I had on me.
But I've thought about this line a lot ever since.
Revenge, or the expression of hatred towards those who have done us injustice may feel like a human instinct in the face of wrong, but we need to break out of these cycles if we are to hope to transform negative events of injustice into positive social change.
To do otherwise continues to let the enemy determine the grounds for battle, creates a binary, where we who have suffered become the affected, pitted against them, the perpetrators.
And just like we got back on our tubes, we can't let our platforms for interconnectivity and community be the places that we settle for defeat.
But I don't want to discourage a social media response, because I owe the development of the #NotGuilty campaign almost entirely to social media.
But I do want to encourage a more considered approach to the way we use it to respond to injustice.
The start, I think, is to ask ourselves two things.
Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice?
In my case, there were several answers to this.
Someone had hurt me and those who I loved, under the assumption they wouldn't have to be held to account or recognize the damage they had caused.
Not only that, but thousands of men and women suffer every day from sexual abuse, often in silence, yet it's still a problem we don't give the same airtime to as other issues.
It's still an issue many people blame victims for.
Next, ask yourself: How, in recognizing these reasons, could I go about reversing them?
With us, this was holding my attacker to account -- and many others.
It was calling them out on the effect they had caused.
It was giving airtime to the issue of sexual assault, opening up discussions amongst friends, amongst families, in the media that had been closed for too long, and stressing that victims shouldn't feel to blame for what happened to them.
We might still have a long way to go in solving this problem entirely.
But in this way, we can begin to use social media as an active tool for social justice, as a tool to educate, to stimulate dialogues, to make those in positions of authority aware of an issue by listening to those directly affected by it.
Because sometimes these questions don't have easy answers.
In fact, they rarely do.
But this doesn't mean we still can't give them a considered response.
In situations where you can't go about thinking how you'd reverse this feeling of injustice, you can still think, maybe not what you can do, but what you can not do.
You can not build further walls by fighting injustice with more prejudice, more hatred.
You can not speak over those directly affected by an injustice.
And you can not react to injustice, only to forget about it the next day, just because the rest of Twitter has moved on.
Sometimes not reacting instantly is, ironically, the best immediate course of action we can take.
Because we might be angry, upset and energized by injustice, but let's consider our responses.
Let us hold people to account, without descending into a culture that thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves.
Let us remember that distinction, so often forgotten by internet users, between criticism and insult.
Let us not forget to think before we speak, just because we might have a screen in front of us.
And when we create noise on social media, let it not drown out the needs of those affected, but instead let it amplify their voices, so the internet becomes a place where you're not the exception if you speak out about something that has actually happened to you.
All these considered approaches to injustice evoke the very keystones on which the internet was built: to network, to have signal, to connect -- all these terms that imply bringing people together, not pushing people apart.
Because if you look up the word "justice" in the dictionary, before punishment, before administration of law or judicial authority, you get: "The maintenance of what is right.
" And I think there are few things more "right" in this world than bringing people together, than unions.
And if we allow social media to deliver that, then it can deliver a very powerful form of justice, indeed.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The language I'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming the world's universal language, for better or for worse.
Let's face it, it's the language of the internet, it's the language of finance, it's the language of air traffic control, of popular music, diplomacy -- English is everywhere.
Now, Mandarin Chinese is spoken by more people, but more Chinese people are learning English than English speakers are learning Chinese.
Last I heard, there are two dozen universities in China right now teaching all in English.
English is taking over.
And in addition to that, it's been predicted that at the end of the century almost all of the languages that exist now -- there are about 6,000 -- will no longer be spoken.
There will only be some hundreds left.
And on top of that, it's at the point where instant translation of live speech is not only possible, but it gets better every year.
The reason I'm reciting those things to you is because I can tell that we're getting to the point where a question is going to start being asked, which is: Why should we learn foreign languages -- other than if English happens to be foreign to one?
Why bother to learn another one when it's getting to the point where almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate in one?
I think there are a lot of reasons, but I first want to address the one that you're probably most likely to have heard of, because actually it's more dangerous than you might think.
And that is the idea that a language channels your thoughts, that the vocabulary and the grammar of different languages gives everybody a different kind of acid trip, so to speak.
That is a marvelously enticing idea, but it's kind of fraught.
So it's not that it's untrue completely.
So for example, in French and Spanish the word for table is, for some reason, marked as feminine.
So, "la table," "la mesa," you just have to deal with it.
So if you're French or Spanish, to you, a table is kind of a girl, as opposed to if you are an English speaker.
It's hard not to love data like that, and many people will tell you that that means that there's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages.
But you have to watch out, because imagine if somebody put us under the microscope, the us being those of us who speak English natively. What is the worldview from English?
So for example, let's take an English speaker.
Up on the screen, that is Bono.
He speaks English.
I presume he has a worldview.
Now, that is Donald Trump.
In his way, he speaks English as well.
(Laughter) And here is Ms. Kardashian, and she is an English speaker, too.
So here are three speakers of the English language.
What worldview do those three people have in common?
What worldview is shaped through the English language that unites them?
It's a highly fraught concept.
And so gradual consensus is becoming that language can shape thought, but it tends to be in rather darling, obscure psychological flutters.
It's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world.
Now, if that's the case, then why learn languages?
If it isn't going to change the way you think, what would the other reasons be?
There are some.
There's no other way.
There's an interesting illustration of this.
I have to go slightly obscure, but really you should seek it out.
There's a movie by the Canadian film director Denys Arcand -- read out in English on the page, "Dennis Ar-cand," if you want to look him up.
He did a film called "Jesus of Montreal.
" And many of the characters are vibrant, funny, passionate, interesting French-Canadian, French-speaking women.
There's one scene closest to the end, where they have to take a friend to an Anglophone hospital.
In the hospital, they have to speak English.
Now, they speak English but it's not their native language, they'd rather not speak English.
And they speak it more slowly, they have accents, they're not idiomatic.
Suddenly these characters that you've fallen in love with become husks of themselves, they're shadows of themselves.
To go into a culture and to only ever process people through that kind of skrim curtain is to never truly get the culture.
And so to the extent that hundreds of languages will be left, one reason to learn them is because they are tickets to being able to participate in the culture of the people who speak them, just by virtue of the fact that it is their code.
So that's one reason.
Second reason: it's been shown that if you speak two languages, dementia is less likely to set in, and that you are probably a better multitasker.
And these are factors that set in early, and so that ought to give you some sense of when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language.
Bilingualism is healthy.
Much more fun than we're often told.
All those things have in common the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars.
They stay still, and the vowels dance around the consonants.
Who wouldn't want to roll that around in their mouths?
You can get that from Hebrew, you can get that from Ethiopia's main language, Amharic.
That's fun.
Learning how to speak with different word order is like driving on the different side of a street if you go to certain country, or the feeling that you get when you put Witch Hazel around your eyes and you feel the tingle.
A language can do that to you.
So for example, "The Cat in the Hat Comes Back," a book that I'm sure we all often return to, like "Moby Dick.
" One phrase in it is, "Do you know where I found him?
Do you know where he was?
" Fine.
Now, if you learn that in Mandarin Chinese, then you have to master, "You can know, I did where him find?
He was tub inside gorging cake, No mistake gorging chewing!
That is what a language can get you.
And more to the point, we live in an era when it's never been easier to teach yourself another language.
It used to be that you had to go to a classroom, and there would be some diligent teacher -- some genius teacher in there -- but that person was only in there at certain times and you had to go then, and then was not most times.
Other than that you had books that didn't work, that's just the way it was.
Today you can lay down -- lie on your living room floor, sipping bourbon, and teach yourself any language that you want to with wonderful sets such as Rosetta Stone.
You can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages.
(Applause)The language I'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming the world's universal language, for better or for worse.
And on top of that, it's at the point where instant translation of live speech is not only possible, but it gets better every year.
I presume he has a worldview.
(Laughter) And here is Ms. Kardashian, and she is an English speaker, too.
It's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world.
And then, third -- languages are just an awful lot of fun.
Who wouldn't want to roll that around in their mouths?
Now, if you learn that in Mandarin Chinese, then you have to master, "You can know, I did where him find?
That is what a language can get you.
And more to the point, we live in an era when it's never been easier to teach yourself another language.
It used to be that you had to go to a classroom, and there would be some diligent teacher -- some genius teacher in there -- but that person was only in there at certain times and you had to go then, and then was not most times.
You had to go to class.
If you didn't have that, you had something called a record.
I cut my teeth on those.
There was only so much data on a record, or a cassette, or even that antique object known as a CD.
Other than that you had books that didn't work, that's just the way it was.
Today you can lay down -- lie on your living room floor, sipping bourbon, and teach yourself any language that you want to with wonderful sets such as Rosetta Stone.
I highly recommend the lesser known Glossika as well.
You can do it any time, therefore you can do it more and better.
You can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages.
I take some "Dilbert" in various languages every single morning; it can increase your skills.
Couldn't have done it 20 years ago when the idea of having any language you wanted in your pocket, coming from your phone, would have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people.
So I highly recommend that you teach yourself languages other than the one that I'm speaking, because there's never been a better time to do it.
It's an awful lot of fun.
It won't change your mind, but it will most certainly blow your mind.
Thank you very much.

This is the Bop.The Bop is a type of social dance. Dance is a language, and social dance is an expression that emerges from a community. A social dance isn't choreographed by any one person. It can't be traced to any one moment.
Why do we dance together?
To heal, to remember, to say: "We speak a common language. We exist and we are free. "
Here's what has to happen for pregnancy to occur after sexual intercourse.
Sperm must swim up the vagina, through the cervical opening, upwards through the uterus, and into one of the two fallopian tubes.
They block the sperm, disable sperm before they reach the uterus, or suppress ovulation.
Hormonal contraceptives, including the pill, the patch, the Depo shot, and the vaginal ring all release synthetic versions of various combinations of progesterone and estrogen.
Block, disable, or suppress: is one strategy better than the other?
There are differences, but a lot of it has to do with how convenient and easy it is to use each contraceptive correctly.
That 98% means if 100 couples correctly used condoms for a year, two women would get pregnant.
But in practice, that's 91%.
Scientists also continue to research new methods, such as a male pill that would prevent sperm production.
Now, I want to tell you about the Yap because their form of money is really interesting.
In 1932, the Bank of France asked the United States to convert their holdings from dollars into gold.
So instead, someone went to where that gold was being stored and they just labeled it as belonging to France now.
The point I want to make with these two examples is that there's nothing inherently valuable about a dollar or a stone or a coin.
The only reason these things have any value is because we've all decided they should.
And because we've decided that, they do.
Money is about the exchanges and the transactions that we have with each other.
Money isn't anything objective.
It's about a collective story that we tell each other about value.
A collective fiction.
And that's a really powerful concept.
In the past two decades, we've begun to use digital money.
So I get paid via direct deposit, I pay my rent via bank transfer, I pay my taxes online.
And every month, a small amount of money is deducted from my paycheck and invested in mutual funds in my retirement account.
All of these interactions are literally just changing 1's and 0's on computers.
There's not even anything physical, like a stone or a coin.
Digital money makes it so that I can pay someone around the world in seconds.
Now when this works, it's because there are large institutions underwriting every 1 or 0 that changes on a computer.
And when it doesn't, it's often the fault of those large institutions.
Or at least, it's up to them to fix the problem.
And a lot of times, they don't.
There's a lot of friction in the system.
How long did it take the US credit card companies to implement chip and pin? Half my credit cards still don't work in Europe.
That's friction.
Transferring money across borders and across currencies is really expensive: friction.
An entrepreneur in India can set up an online business in minutes, but it's hard for her to get loans and to get paid: friction.
Our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact is being held captive by these gatekeepers.
And there's a lot of impediments in the system slowing things down.
That's because digital money isn't really mine, it's entries in databases that belong to my bank, my credit card company or my investment firm.
And these companies have the right to say "no.
" If I'm a PayPal merchant and PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud, that's it.
My account gets frozen, and I can't get paid.
These institutions are standing in the way of innovation.
How many of you use Facebook photos, Google Photos, Instagram?
My photos are everywhere.
They are on my phone, they're on my laptop, they're on my old phone, they're in Dropbox.
They're on all these different websites and services.
And most of these services don't work together.
They don't inter-operate.
And as a result, my photo library is a mess. The same thing happens when institutions control the money supply.
A lot of these services don't inter-operate, and as a result, this blocks what we can do with payment.
And it makes transaction costs go up.
So far, we've been through two phases of money.
In an analog world, we had to deal with these physical objects, and money moved at a certain speed -- the speed of humans.
In a digital world, money can reach much farther and is much faster, but we're at the mercy of these gatekeeper institutions.
Money only moves at the speed of banks.
We're about to enter a new phase of money.
When we combine software and currency, money becomes more than just a static unit of value, and we don't have to rely on institutions for security.
In a programmable world, we remove humans and institutions from the loop.
And when this happens, we won't even feel like we're transacting anymore.
Money will be directed by software, and it will just safely and securely flow.
It's money designed to work in a world without intermediaries.
There's Ethereum, Litecoin, Stellar, Dogecoin, and those are just a few of the more popular ones.
The sushi restaurant down my street takes Bitcoin.
I have an app on my phone that I can use to buy sashimi.
In March, there was a transaction that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.
That's the equivalent of 40 million US dollars.
Cryptography is the study of how to secure communication, and it's about two really important things: masking information so it can be hidden in plain sight, and verifying a piece of information's source.
Today, anyone with a modern web browser is running a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.
And this means that we don't have to rely on the banks anymore to secure our transactions.
We can do it ourselves.
Bitcoin is based on the very same idea that the Yap used, this collective global knowledge of transfers.
In Bitcoin, I spend by transferring Bitcoin, and I get paid when someone transfers Bitcoin to me. Imagine that we had this magic paper.
Whenever the dice come up all sixes, we say that we win.
Cryptocurrencies are the first step to a world with a global programmable money.
This is a really amazing thing.
And just like the Internet changed the way we communicate, programmable money is going to change the way we pay, allocate and decide on value.
So what kind of world does programmable money create?
Imagine a world where I can rent out my healthcare data to a pharmaceutical company.
They can run large-scale data analysis and provide me with a cryptographic proof that shows they're only using my data in a way that we agreed.
And they can pay me for what they find out. 
Instead of signing up for streaming services and getting a cable bill, what if my television analyzed my watching habits and recommended well-priced content that fit within my budget that I would enjoy?
If it cost a fraction of a cent to send an email, would we still have spam?
We're not at this world yet, but it's coming.
Right now, it's like we're in a world that is seeing the first automobile.
The first cryptocurrency, like the first car, is slow and hard to understand and hard to use.
Digital money, like the horse and carriage, works pretty well, and the whole world economy is built on it.
" But we all know how that story turns out.
We're entering a new era of programmable money. And it's very exciting, but it's also a little bit scary.
Who's advantaged in this new world and who isn't?
Will I have to start to pay for things that I didn't have to pay for before?
Will we all become slaves to algorithms and utility functions?
All new technology comes with trade-offs. The Internet brought us a lot of ways to waste time.
But it also greatly increased productivity.
Mobile phones are annoying because they make me feel like I have to stay connected to work all the time.
But they also help me stay connected to friends and family.
The new sharing economy is going to eliminate some jobs.
But it's also going to create new, flexible forms of employment.
With programmable money, we decouple the need for large, trusted institutions from the architecture of the network.
And this pushes innovation in money out to the edges, where it belongs.
Programmable money democratizes money.
And because of this, things are going to change and unfold in ways that we can't even predict.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I spend most of my time thinking about little girls, which is kind of a weird thing for a grown man in our society to say.
But I do. 
I spend most of my time thinking about little girls, and I think it's primarily because I have one.
This one's mine, and I think you would really like her.
She is smart and funny and kind to people and a good friend.
But when I talk about my daughter, the word I find myself saying most is "athlete. " My kid's athletic.
She is strong and fast and has great balance and good body control.
She is a three-time, back-to-back-to-back state champion in Shaolin Kempo.
At nine years old, she is already halfway to a black belt.
My daughter is athletic.
Now, when a man who is six feet two and 265 pounds stands in front of you and says his daughter is athletic, you might think that's a reflection of him.
It is not.
(Laughter) My wife in high school was a two-time all-state soccer player and a two-time all-state volleyball player, and I played "Dungeons and Dragons.
" And that is why, although my daughter is an athlete, she's also a huge nerd, which I love.
She walks around our house in a cloak of flames that she made herself.
She sits on the Iron Throne -- (Laughter) even though she has never seen "Game of Thrones," primarily because we are not the worst parents who ever lived.
But she knows there's someone called the Mother of Dragons, and she calls herself that and she loves it.
She's a huge comic book fan. Right now, her favorite character is Groot.
She loves Groot. She adores The Incredible Hulk.
But my daughter really at heart, her thing is Star Wars.
(Laughter) But here's the question that I have to ask.
Why is it that when my daughter dresses up, whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk, whether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul, why is every character she dresses up as a boy?
And where are all the female superheroes?
And that is not actually the question, because there's plenty of female superheroes.
My question really is, where is all the female superhero stuff?Where are the costumes?
Where are the toys?
Because every day when my daughter plays when she dresses up, she's learning stuff through a process that, in my own line of work, as a professor of media studies, we refer to as public pedagogy.
That is, it is how societies are taught ideologies.
It's how you learned what it meant to be a man or a woman, what it meant to behave yourself in public, what it meant to be a patriot and have good manners.
It's all the constituent social relations that make us up as a people.
It's, in short, how we learn what we know about other people and about the world.
But we live in a 100-percent media-saturated society.
What that means is that every single aspect of your human existence outside of your basic bodily functions is in some way touched by media.
From the car that you drive to the food that you eat to the clothes that you wear to the way you construct your relationships to the very language you use to formulate thought -- all of that is in some way mediated.
So the answer in our society to how do we learn what we know about other people and about the world is largely through media.
Well, there's a wrinkle in that, in that our society, media don't simply exist as information distribution technologies and devices.
They also exist as corporate entities.
And when the distribution of information is tied to financial gain, there's a problem.
How big of a problem?
Well think about this: in 1983, 90 percent of American media were owned by 50 companies.
In any market, 50 companies doing something is a lot of companies.
It's a lot of different worldviews.
In 2015, that number has shrunk to six, six companies.
They are NBCUniversal Comcast, AOL Time Warner, the Walt Disney Company, News Corp, Viacom and the CBS Corporation.
These six companies produce nine out of every 10 movies you watch, nine out of every 10 television shows, nine out of every 10 songs, nine out of every 10 books.
So my question to you is, if six companies control 90 percent of American media, how much influence do you think they have over what you're allowed to see every day?
Because in media studies, we spend a lot of time saying that media can't tell us what to think, and they can't; they're terrible at that.
But that's not their job.
Media don't tell us what to think.
Media tell us what to think about.
They control the conversation, and in controlling the conversation, they don't have to get you to think what they want you to think.
They'll just get you thinking about the things they want you to think about, and more importantly, not thinking about things they don't want you to think about.
They control the conversation.
How does this work in practice?
Let's just take one of those companies.
We'll do an easy one.
Let's talk about the Walt Disney Company for a second.
The reason why I always pick the Walt Disney Company is this.
Is there a single person in this room who has never seen a Disney movie?
Look around. Exactly. 
I picked Disney because they have what we call 100 percent penetration in our society.
Every single person has been exposed to Disney, so it's an easy one for me to use.
Since 1937, Disney has made most of its money selling princesses to girls.
It's made a huge chunk of its money.
Unless, of course, the princess your daughter is interested in, as my daughter is, is this one.
See, in 2012, Disney purchased LucasFilm for the sum of four billion dollars, and immediately they flooded the Disney stores with Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker and Yoda and not Princess Leia.
Why?
Because this princess messes up the public pedagogy for these princesses.
And Disney said, "Wait, that's not what we meant.
What we meant was, we don't have any Princess Leia merchandise yet, but we will.
" And that was in 2012, and it is 2015, and if you go to the Disney Store, as I recently have, and look for Princess Leia merchandise, do you know how many Princess Leia items there are in the Disney Store?
Zero, because Disney has no intention of putting Princess Leia in the store.
And we shouldn't be surprised because we found out that was their policy when they bought Marvel in 2009 for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.
Because when you make a lot of money selling princesses to girls, you also kind of want to make money from boys.
And so what better to sell boys than superheroes?
So now Disney had access to Captain America and to Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and they had access even to a group of superheroes no one had ever even heard of. That's how good Marvel was at selling superheroes.
Last year, they released a film called "Guardians of the Galaxy. " It's a film that absolutely should not work.
Nobody knew who they were except for comic book nerds like me. One of the characters is a talking tree.
One of the characters is an anthropomorphic raccoon.
It should not work.
And they made a killing off of "Guardians of the Galaxy. " This character here in the middle, her name is Gamora.
She's played by Zoe Saldana, and she is strong and smart and fast and fights like a ninja, and she is played by a beautiful black woman, and my daughter fell in love with her.
So like any good nerd dad, I went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff, and when I got to the store, I learned a very interesting thing.
If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack, well, Gamora's not on it.
They probably should have marketed this as "some" of the Guardians of the Galaxy. (Laughter) And if I wanted to buy her a lunchbox, she wasn't on it, and if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt, she wasn't on it.
And as a matter of fact, if I went to the store, as I did, and looked at the display, you would find a small picture of Gamora right here, but if you look at any of the actual merchandise on that shelf, Gamora is not on any of it.
Now, I could have taken to Twitter with the hashtag #WheresGamora, like millions of fans did across the world, but the truth was I wasn't even really that surprised, because I was there when Disney had released "The Avengers.
" And just this year, we got a new Avengers movie, the "Age of Ultron," and we were very excited, because there was not one but two female superheroes, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow.
And we were very excited.
And if you go to the Disney store and look for a Black Widow costume, what you will find, is you will find Captain America and The Incredible Hulk.
You will find Iron Man and Thor.
You will even find War Machine, who isn't even really in the movie that long.
Who you will not find is Black Widow.
And I could have gone to Twitter with the hashtag, as many people did, # WheresNatasha. But I'm tired of doing that.
I'm tired of having to do that. All over the country right now, there are kids playing with the Cycle Blast Quinjet play set, where Captain America rides a motorcycle out of a moving jet and it's really awesome.
You know how awesome it is?
So awesome that when it happened in the movie, it was Black Widow that did it.
Not only has she been erased, but she has been replaced with a male figure.
And so what is this teaching us?
They will not be the main character.
She will either be ignored like Gamora or erased and replaced with a boy like Black Widow. And it's not fair.
It's not fair to her and it's not fair to your sons and daughters either.
But here's the thing: I'm raising a little girl, and she has a little tomboy in her, which by the way is a terrible thing to call a girl.
What that basically is saying is, those traits that define you, they're not really yours, they're just on loan to you for a little while from boys.
But do you know how much grief she's going to take in her life for having a little tomboy in her? Zero. None. 
People will think it's cute.
They'll call her feisty, because in our society, adding so-called male traits to girls is seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.
I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike.
Mike is a little boy in Florida.
He's 11 years old, and the thing that he loves most in the world is a show called "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic," like millions of other children across America.
Now, the show is marketed to girls ages five to nine, but there are millions of boys and grown men who enjoy "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.
" They have a club.
They call themselves Bronies, pony bros, guys who like ponies.
I happen to be one of them.
And what are Mike and myself and millions of other boys and men learning in this feminine, sissified world of "My Little Pony?
" Well, they're learning to study hard and to work hard and to party hard and to look good and to feel good and to do good, and heaven preserve us from teaching these wussified concepts to boys.
So the other kids in his neighborhood pick on Mike and they beat him up and they make fun of him, and at 11 years old, Mike goes home, finds a belt, wraps it around his neck, and hangs himself from the top bunk of his bed.
Because we have developed a society in which you would rather be dead as a boy than thought of as liking stuff for girls.
And that is not Mike's fault.
That is our fault.
We have failed him.
We have failed our children.
And we have to do better for them.
We have to stop making it so that the only female superheroes appear on shirts that are pink and cut for girls.
We have to stop.
And when I was putting this together, people said to me, "Well, that's never going to happen. " And I said, "Oh really?
" Because just this year, Target announced that they were going to stop gendering their toy aisles.
They were going to mix it up.
So let's don't pat ourselves on the back too much.
Just this week also, Disney announced it was no longer going to gender its Halloween costumes, which I say, "Thank you, Disney, except the only costumes you make are of male superheroes, so does it matter who you have wearing them?
" Just this week, Mattel, who makes Barbie, announced they're going to release a line of DC superhero girls.
And the funny thing is, they met with girls and asked them what they wanted to see in dolls, and you can see, they have calves and elbows that bend so they can do superhero stuff.
And please buy them.
And don't just buy them for your daughters, buy them for your sons.
Because it's important that boys play with and as female superheroes just as my daughter plays with and as male superheroes.
It says, "Is this toy operated with your genitals?
" (Laughter) If the answer is yes, then that is not a toy for children.
(Laughter) And if the answer is no, then it's for boys and girls.
It's really simple.
But I do. 
I spend most of my time thinking about little girls, and I think it's primarily because I have one.
This one's mine, and I think you would really like her.
She is smart and funny and kind to people and a good friend.
But when I talk about my daughter, the word I find myself saying most is "athlete. " My kid's athletic.
She is strong and fast and has great balance and good body control.
She is a three-time, back-to-back-to-back state champion in Shaolin Kempo.
At nine years old, she is already halfway to a black belt.
My daughter is athletic.
Now, when a man who is six feet two and 265 pounds stands in front of you and says his daughter is athletic, you might think that's a reflection of him.
It is not.
(Laughter) My wife in high school was a two-time all-state soccer player and a two-time all-state volleyball player, and I played "Dungeons and Dragons.

She's a huge comic book fan. 
Right now, her favorite character is Groot.
She loves Groot. She adores The Incredible Hulk.
But my daughter really at heart, her thing is Star Wars.
My kid is a Jedi.
Although some days she's also a Sith, which is a choice that I can respect.
(Laughter) But here's the question that I have to ask.
Why is it that when my daughter dresses up, whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk, whether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul, why is every character she dresses up as a boy?

Imagine that you are a product designer. And you've designed a product, a new type of product, called the human immune system.
You're pitching this product to a skeptical, strictly no-nonsense manager.
Let's call him Bob.
I think we all know at least one Bob, right?
How would that go?
Bob, I've got this incredible idea for a completely new type of personal health product.
It's called the human immune system.
I can see from your face that you're having some problems with this.
Don't worry.
I know it's very complicated.
And it cleverly leverages diversity by having not just leukocytes but B cells, T cells, natural killer cells, antibodies. The components don't really matter.
The point is that together, this diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything that evolution has been able to throw up.
And the design is completely modular.
You have the surface barrier of the human skin, you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system.
The point is, that if one system fails, another can take over, creating a virtually foolproof system.
I can see I'm losing you, Bob, but stay with me, because here is the really killer feature. The product is completely adaptive.
It's able to actually develop targeted antibodies to threats that it's never even met before. 
It actually also does this with incredible prudence, detecting and reacting to every tiny threat, and furthermore, remembering every previous threat, in case they are ever encountered again.
What I'm pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product.
The product is embedded in the larger system of the human body, and it works in complete harmony with that system, to create this unprecedented level of biological protection.
So Bob, just tell me honestly, what do you think of my product?
And Bob may say something like, I sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone into your presentation, blah blah blah -- (Laughter) But honestly, it's total nonsense.
You seem to be saying that the key selling points of your product are that it is inefficient and complex.
Didn't they teach you 80-20? And furthermore, you're saying that this product is siloed.
It overreacts, makes things up as it goes along and is actually designed for somebody else's benefit.
I'm sorry to break it to you, but I don't think this one is a winner.
If we went with Bob's philosophy, I think we'd actually end up with a more efficient immune system.
And efficiency is always important in the short term.
Who could say no to that?
Unfortunately, there's one very tiny problem, and that is that the user of this product, you or I, would probably die within one week of the next winter, when we encountered a new strain of the influenza virus.
I first became interested in biology and business, and longevity and resilience, when I was asked a very unusual question by the CEO of a global tech company.
And the question was: What do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts 100 years?
A seemingly innocent question, but actually, it's a little trickier than you might think, considering that the average US public company now can expect a life span of only 30 years.
That is less than half of the life span that its employees can expect to enjoy.
Now, if you were the CEO of such a company, badgered by investors and buffeted by change, we might forgive you for not even worrying too much about what happens 30 years out.
But here's something that should keep you awake at night: the probability that your company will not be around in five year's time, on average, is now a staggering 32 percent.
That's a one in three chance that your company will be taken over or will fail within just five years.
Let's come back to our tech CEO's question.
Where better to turn for advice than nature, that's been in the business of life and death for longer than any company?
As a lapsed biologist, I decided to immediately call a real biologist, my friend Simon Levin, Professor of Biology and Mathematics at Princeton University.
Together, we looked at a variety of biological systems, ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries.
And what we found was that the same six principles that we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system actually cropped up again and again, from redundancy through to embeddedness.
In fact, we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems, we also found them being very characteristic of long-lived social systems, like the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church, believe it or not.
We also went on to look at business, and found that these very same properties also characterized businesses that were resilient and long-lived, and we noted their absence from ones which were short-lived.
Let's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system collapses.
In fact, it's one of the oldest temples in Japan.
It was built by a Korean artisan, because at the time, Japan was not yet building temples.
Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi, was still around 1,428 years later.
In fact, it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world.
So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?
Not too well, I'm afraid.
It borrowed very heavily during the bubble period of the Japanese economy, to invest in real estate. And when the bubble burst, it couldn't refinance its loans.
He meant, of course, that they were able to create more options than the rivals.
The ultimate test of resilience.
Just five days.
Toyota managed its network of suppliers in such a collaborative manner that it could work very quickly and smoothly with suppliers to repurpose production, fill the missing braking valve capacity and have car production come online again.
Toyota applied the principles of modularity of its supply network, embeddedness in an integrated system and the functional redundancy to be able to repurpose, smoothly, existing capacity.
And yes, technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics.
Now typically, when we think about business, we use what I call "mechanical thinking.
" We set goals, we analyze problems, we construct and we adhere to plans, and more than anything else, we stress efficiency and short-term performance.
Now, don't get me wrong -- this is a splendidly practical and effective way of addressing relatively simple challenges in relatively stable environments.
The ball would head in a straight line, probably towards the intended target, and the bird certainly would not.
Not at all. Every small entrepreneurial company naturally thinks and acts biologically.
They need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically in order to survive and thrive in today's environment. So let's not just think about short-term performance.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)Imagine that you are a product designer. And you've designed a product, a new type of product, called the human immune system.
I think we all know at least one Bob, right?
How would that go?
Bob, I've got this incredible idea for a completely new type of personal health product.
It's called the human immune system.
I can see from your face that you're having some problems with this.
Who could say no to that?
And the question was: What do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts 100 years?
A seemingly innocent question, but actually, it's a little trickier than you might think, considering that the average US public company now can expect a life span of only 30 years.
That's a one in three chance that your company will be taken over or will fail within just five years.
And we asked ourselves the question: What makes these systems resilient and enduring?
And what we found was that the same six principles that we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system actually cropped up again and again, from redundancy through to embeddedness.
This beautiful building is part of the Shitennoji Temple Complex in Osaka, Japan.
In fact, it's one of the oldest temples in Japan.
And this Korean artisan went on to found a temple-building company.
Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi, was still around 1,428 years later.
So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?
Not too well, I'm afraid.
Fujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry, material science and optics to diversify into a number of areas, ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals, to medical systems to biomaterials.
Some of these diversification attempts failed.
He meant, of course, that they were able to create more options than the rivals.
The ultimate test of resilience.
Car production ground to a screeching halt.
How was it, then, that Toyota was able to recover car production?
From having no braking valves to complete recovery in five days. How was this possible?
Toyota managed its network of suppliers in such a collaborative manner that it could work very quickly and smoothly with suppliers to repurpose production, fill the missing braking valve capacity and have car production come online again.
Toyota applied the principles of modularity of its supply network, embeddedness in an integrated system and the functional redundancy to be able to repurpose, smoothly, existing capacity.
Now fortunately, few companies succumb to catastrophic fires.
But we do read in the newspaper every day about companies succumbing to the disruption of technology.
How is it, then, that the consumer optics giant Essilor is able to avoid technology disruption, and even profit from it?
And yes, technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics.
Essilor carefully scans the competitive environment for potentially disruptive technologies.
It acquires those technologies very early, before they've become expensive or competitors have mobilized around them, and it then develops those technologies itself, even at the risk of failure or the risk of self-disruption.
Essilor stays ahead of its game, and has delivered spectacular performance for over 40 years, by using the principles of prudence and adaptation.
OK, if these principles are so powerful, you might be thinking, why are they not commonplace in business?
Why do we not use these words every day?
Well, change has to first start in the mind.
If we think back to our pitch to Bob, in order to apply the principles that underpin the miracle of the human immune system, we first need to think differently about business.
Now typically, when we think about business, we use what I call "mechanical thinking.
" We set goals, we analyze problems, we construct and we adhere to plans, and more than anything else, we stress efficiency and short-term performance.
Now, don't get me wrong -- this is a splendidly practical and effective way of addressing relatively simple challenges in relatively stable environments.
It's the way that Bob -- and probably many of us, myself included -- process most business problems we're faced with every day.
In fact, it was a pretty good mental model for business -- overall -- until about the mid-1980s, when the conjunction of globalization and a revolution in technology and telecommunications made business far more dynamic and unpredictable.
But what about those more dynamic and unpredictable situations that we now increasingly face?
I think in addition to the mechanical thinking, we now need to master the art of biological thinking, as embodied by our six principles.
In other words, we need to think more modestly and subtly about when and how we can shape, rather than control, unpredictable and complex situations.
It's a little like the difference between throwing a ball and releasing a bird.
The ball would head in a straight line, probably towards the intended target, and the bird certainly would not.
So what do you think?
Sounds a little impractical, a little theoretical, perhaps?
Not at all. Every small entrepreneurial company naturally thinks and acts biologically.
Why?
Because it lacks the resources to shape its environment through brute force.
It lacks the scale to buffer change, and it's constantly thinking about the tough odds for a start-up to survive.
Now, the irony is, of course, that every large company started off as a small, entrepreneurial company.
But along the way somewhere, many have lost this ability to think and act biologically.
They need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically in order to survive and thrive in today's environment. So let's not just think about short-term performance.
Every company I know spends plenty of time thinking about the central question of strategy: How good is our competitive game?
In addition, let's also consider the second, more biological and equally important question: How long will that game last?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
People lived and worked with each other in a place that gave them a sense of belonging and made them feel at home.
They shared a remarkably unified existence. But over the last century, gradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with; first, by the urban planners of the colonial period, when the French went enthusiastically about, transforming what they saw as the un-modern Syrian cities.
From my point of view, losing the sense of belonging to a place and a sense of sharing it with someone else has made it a lot easier to destroy.

At Free America, we've done a listening and learning tour.
We visited not only with prosecutors but with legislators, with inmates in our state and local prisons.
We've gone to immigration detention centers.
We've met a lot of people.
And we've seen that redemption and transformation can happen in our prisons, our jails and our immigration detention centers, giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time.
Imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline.
What would it look like if we intervened, with rehabilitation as a core value -- with love and compassion as core values?
We would have a society that is safer, healthier and worthy of raising our children in.
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.
James served 12 years in the San Quentin State Prison and is being released in 18 months.
Now James, like you and me, is more than the worst thing he's done.
He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.
He committed a crime; he's paying his debt, and working hard to build the skills to make the transition back to a productive life when he enters the civilian population again.
Now James, like millions of people behind bars, is an example of what happens if we believe that our failings don't define who we are, that we are all worthy of redemption and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration, we can all heal together.
I'd like to introduce you to James right now, and he's going to share his journey of redemption through spoken word.
James Cavitt: Thanks, John.
TED, welcome to San Quentin.
The talent is abundant behind prison walls.
Future software engineers, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, musicians and artists.
This piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and futures for themselves after they serve their time.
This piece is entitled, "Where I Live.
" I live in a world where most people are too afraid to go.
Surrounded by tall, concrete walls, steel bars, where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow.
I live in a world that kill people who kill people in order to teach people that killing people is wrong.
Imagine that.
Better yet, imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal and become strong.
Maybe then we would all be singin' "Redemption Song.
" I live in a world that has been called "hell on Earth" by those trapped inside.
But I've come to the stark realization that prison -- it really is what you make it.
You see, in spite of the harshness of my reality, there is a silver lining.
I knew that my freedom was gonna come, it was just a matter of time.
And so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile, and I realized that you don't have to be free in order to experience freedom.
And just because you're free, doesn't mean that you have freedom.
Many of us, for years, have been battling our inner demons.
We walk around smiling when inside we're really screamin': freedom!
Don't you get it?
As for me, I choose to be free from the prisons I've created.
The key: forgiveness.
It's a mind setting.
(Applause) (Piano) John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I.
Sold I to the merchant ships.
Minutes after they took I from the bottomless pit.
My hands were made strong by the hand of the almighty.
Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom?
Redemption songs.
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Have no fear for atomic energy 'cause none of them can stop the time.
Some say it's just a part of it, we've got to fulfill the book.
Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever had -- redemption songs.
Redemption songs.
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Have no fear for atomic energy 'cause none of them can stop the time.
Some say it's just a part of it, we've got to fulfill the book.
'Cause all I ever had -- redemption songs.
'Cause all I ever had -- redemption songs.

The scout's job is not to attack or defend. The scout's job is to understand. The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles.
And the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge in a convenient location across a river. But above all, the scout wants to know what's really there, as accurately as possible.
To illustrate these mindsets in action, I'm going to take you back to 19th-century France, where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history.
I mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up, that they were intentionally framing him.But historians don't think that's what happened.
And the answer is emotional.
So, just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like defensiveness or tribalism, scout mindset is, too.
It's just rooted in different emotions.
For example, scouts are curious.
They're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle.
They're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations.
They're more likely to say they think it's virtuous to test your own beliefs, and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak.
They're about how you feel.There's a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.
Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.
" In other words, I claim, if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies, what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics, even though those things are quite valuable.
But what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset.
We need to change the way we feel.
We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something.
We need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs.
So the question I want to leave you with is: What do you most yearn for?
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs?
Or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can?
Thank you.
So now, I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role, that of the scout.
The scout's job is not to attack or defend. The scout's job is to understand. The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles.
And the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge in a convenient location across a river. But above all, the scout wants to know what's really there, as accurately as possible.

They're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations.
Scouts also have different values.
They're more likely to say they think it's virtuous to test your own beliefs, and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak.
They're about how you feel.There's a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.
He's the author of "The Little Prince.
" He said, "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work.
Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.
" In other words, I claim, if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies, what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics, even though those things are quite valuable.

Thank you.

I could never have imagined that a 19-year-old suicide bomber would actually teach me a valuable lesson.
But he did.
He taught me to never presume anything about anyone you don't know.
On a Thursday morning in July 2005, the bomber and I, unknowingly, boarded the same train carriage at the same time, standing, apparently, just feet apart.
I didn't see him.
Actually, I didn't see anyone.
You know not to look at anyone on the Tube, but I guess he saw me.
I guess he looked at all of us, as his hand hovered over the detonation switch.
Especially in those final seconds.
I know it wasn't personal.
He didn't set out to kill or maim me, Gill Hicks.
I mean -- he didn't know me. No. Instead, he gave me an unwarranted and an unwanted label.
I had become the enemy.
To him, I was the "other," the "them," as opposed to "us.
" The label "enemy" allowed him to dehumanize us.
Twenty-six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone, and I was almost one of them.
We were helping each other.
I'm alive. OK. " "I'm Gill.
Here. Alive. OK. " I didn't know Alison.
But I listened for her check-ins every few minutes.
I didn't know Richard.
And here is my beloved briefcase, also rescued from that morning.
They didn't know that I published architecture and design journals, that I was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, that I wore black -- still do -- that I smoked cigarillos.
I held on for almost an hour, an hour to contemplate the whole of my life up until this point.
Who I was on my business card mattered to me.
What they told me very clearly was that my life was saved, purely because I was a human being.
We were calling out our names, a little bit like a roll call, waiting for responses.
"I'm Gill.
I'm here.
But I listened for her check-ins every few minutes.
I didn't know Richard.
But it mattered to me that he survived.
All I shared with them was my first name.
They didn't know that I was a head of a department at the Design Council.
And here is my beloved briefcase, also rescued from that morning.
They didn't know that I published architecture and design journals, that I was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, that I wore black -- still do -- that I smoked cigarillos.
I don't smoke cigarillos anymore.
I drank gin and I watched TED Talks, of course, never dreaming that one day I would be standing, balancing on prosthetic legs, giving a talk.
I was a young Australian woman doing extraordinary things in London.
And I wasn't ready for that all to end.
I was so determined to survive that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs, and I just shut everything and everyone out, to focus, to listen to myself, to be guided by instinct alone.
I lowered my breathing rate.
I elevated my thighs. I held myself upright and I fought the urge to close my eyes.
I held on for almost an hour, an hour to contemplate the whole of my life up until this point.
Perhaps I should have done more.
Perhaps I could have lived more, seen more.
Maybe I should have gone running, dancing, taken up yoga.
But my priority and my focus was always my work.
I lived to work.
Who I was on my business card mattered to me.
But it didn't matter down in that tunnel.
By the time I felt that first touch from one of my rescuers, I was unable to speak, unable to say even a small word, like "Gill.
" I surrendered my body to them.
I had done all I possibly could, and now I was in their hands.
I understood just who and what humanity really is, when I first saw the ID tag that was given to me when I was admitted to hospital.
And it read: "One unknown estimated female. " One unknown estimated female. Those four words were my gift.
What they told me very clearly was that my life was saved, purely because I was a human being.
Difference of any kind made no difference to the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go to save my life, to save as many unknowns as they could, and putting their own lives at risk.
To them, it didn't matter if I was rich or poor, the color of my skin, whether I was male or female, my sexual orientation, who I voted for, whether I was educated, if I had a faith or no faith at all.
Nothing mattered other than I was a precious human life.
I see myself as a living fact. 
I am proof that unconditional love and respect can not only save, but it can transform lives.
Here is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I taken just last year.
Ten years after the event, and here we are, arm in arm.
Throughout all the chaos, my hand was held tightly.
My face was stroked gently.
What did I feel?
I felt loved.
What's shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution, what's given me the courage to say: this ends with me is love.
I was loved.
I believe the potential for widespread positive change is absolutely enormous because I know what we're capable of.
I know the brilliance of humanity.
So this leaves me with some pretty big things to ponder and some questions for us all to consider: Is what unites us not far greater than what can ever divide?
Does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species, as human beings?
And when will we embrace the wisdom of our era to rise above mere tolerance and move to an acceptance for all who are only a label until we know them?
Thank you. (Applause)
What is it that French people do better than all the others?
If you would take polls, the top three answers might be: love, wine and whining.
(Laughter) Maybe.
But let me suggest a fourth one: mathematics.
Did you know that Paris has more mathematicians than any other city in the world?
And more streets with mathematicians' names, too.
And if you look at the statistics of the Fields Medal, often called the Nobel Prize for mathematics, and always awarded to mathematicians below the age of 40, you will find that France has more Fields medalists per inhabitant than any other country.
What is it that we find so sexy in math?
The reward may be big.
Hidden mathematical truths permeate our whole physical world. They are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses.
And open your eyes now to the statistics of the velocities of these particles.
This curve tells about the statistics of velocities of particles in the same way as a demographic curve would tell about the statistics of ages of individuals.
It keeps on occurring again and again, from many theories and many experiments, as a great example of the universality which is so dear to us mathematicians.
Of this curve, the famous scientist Francis Galton said, "It would have been deified by the Greeks if they had known it.
It is the supreme law of unreason.
All in complete randomness and chaos.
(Board shaking) This is a bit of a sport, because we need to resolve some traffic jams in there. Aha. We think that randomness is going to play me a trick on stage.
the Gauss Curve, trapped here inside this transparent box as Dream in "The Sandman" comics.
For you I have shown it, but to my students I explain why it could not be any other curve.
And this is touching the mystery of that goddess, replacing a beautiful coincidence by a beautiful explanation.
All of science is like this.
And beautiful mathematical explanations are not only for our pleasure.
They also change our vision of the world.
For instance, Einstein, Perrin, Smoluchowski, they used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories and the Gauss Curve to explain and prove that our world is made of atoms.
It was not the first time that mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world.
More than 2,000 years ago, at the time of the ancient Greeks, it already occurred.
In those days, only a small fraction of the world had been explored, and the Earth might have seemed infinite.
But clever Eratosthenes, using mathematics, was able to measure the Earth with an amazing accuracy of two percent.
Here's another example.
In 1673, Jean Richer noticed that a pendulum swings slightly slower in Cayenne than in Paris.
From this observation alone, and clever mathematics, Newton rightly deduced that the Earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles, like 0.3 percent -- so tiny that you wouldn't even notice it on the real view of the Earth.
These stories show that mathematics is able to make us go out of our intuition measure the Earth which seems infinite, see atoms which are invisible or detect an imperceptible variation of shape.
And if there is just one thing that you should take home from this talk, it is this: mathematics allows us to go beyond the intuition and explore territories which do not fit within our grasp.
Here's a modern example you will all relate to: searching the Internet.
The World Wide Web, more than one billion web pages -- do you want to go through them all?
Computing power helps, but it would be useless without the mathematical modeling to find the information hidden in the data.
Let's work out a baby problem.
Imagine that you're a detective working on a crime case, and there are many people who have their version of the facts.
Who do you want to interview first?
Sensible answer: prime witnesses.
You see, suppose that there is person number seven, tells you a story, but when you ask where he got if from, he points to person number three as a source.
And maybe person number three, in turn, points at person number one as the primary source.
Now number one is a prime witness, so I definitely want to interview him -- priority.
And from the graph we also see that person number four is a prime witness.
And maybe I even want to interview him first, because there are more people who refer to him.
OK, that was easy, but now what about if you have a big bunch of people who will testify?
And this graph, I may think of it as all people who testify in a complicated crime case, but it may just as well be web pages pointing to each other, referring to each other for contents.
Which ones are the most authoritative?
Not so clear.
Enter PageRank, one of the early cornerstones of Google.
This algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness to determine automatically the most relevant web pages, in the same way as we used randomness in the Galton Board experiment.
So let's send into this graph a bunch of tiny, digital marbles and let them go randomly through the graph.
Each time they arrive at some site, they will go out through some link chosen at random to the next one.
And again, and again, and again.
And with small, growing piles, we'll keep the record of how many times each site has been visited by these digital marbles.
Here we go.
Randomness, randomness.
And from time to time, also let's make jumps completely randomly to increase the fun.
And look at this: from the chaos will emerge the solution.
The highest piles correspond to those sites which somehow are better connected than the others, more pointed at than the others.
And here we see clearly which are the web pages we want to first try.
Once again, the solution emerges from the randomness.
Of course, since that time, Google has come up with much more sophisticated algorithms, but already this was beautiful.
That's because of the applications: communication theory, information theory, game theory, compressed sensing, machine learning, graph analysis, harmonic analysis.
And why not stochastic processes, linear programming, or fluid simulation?
Each of these fields have monster industrial applications.
And through them, there is big money in mathematics.
And let me concede that when it comes to making money from the math, the Americans are by a long shot the world champions, with clever, emblematic billionaires and amazing, giant companies, all resting, ultimately, on good algorithm.
Now with all this beauty, usefulness and wealth, mathematics does look more sexy.
But don't you think that the life a mathematical researcher is an easy one.
It is filled with perplexity, frustration, a desperate fight for understanding.
Let me evoke for you one of the most striking days in my mathematician's life.
Or should I say, one of the most striking nights.
At that time, I was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton -- for many years, the home of Albert Einstein and arguably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world.
And that night I was working and working on an elusive proof, which was incomplete.
It was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas, which are a crowd of electrons.
In the perfect world of plasma, there are no collisions and no friction to provide the stability like we are used to.
But still, if you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium, you will find that the resulting electric field spontaneously vanishes, or damps out, as if by some mysterious friction force.
This paradoxical effect, called the Landau damping, is one of the most important in plasma physics, and it was discovered through mathematical ideas.
But still, a full mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was missing.
And together with my former student and main collaborator Clément Mouhot, in Paris at the time, we had been working for months and months on such a proof.
Actually, I had already announced by mistake that we could solve it.
But the truth is, the proof was just not working.
In spite of more than 100 pages of complicated, mathematical arguments, and a bunch discoveries, and huge calculation, it was not working.
And that night in Princeton, a certain gap in the chain of arguments was driving me crazy.
I was putting in there all my energy and experience and tricks, and still nothing was working.
1 a. m. , 2 a. m. , 3 a. m. , not working.
Around 4 a. m. , I go to bed in low spirits.
Then a few hours later, waking up and go, "Ah, it's time to get the kids to school --" What is this?
There was this voice in my head, I swear.
"Take the second term to the other side, Fourier transform and invert in L2." (Laughter) Damn it, that was the start of the solution!
That being said, it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work.
And gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible.
And because it was a collective adventure, you need to share it, not just with your collaborators.
So in a few years, when you come to Paris, after tasting the great, crispy baguette and macaroon, please come and visit us at Institut Henri Poincaré, and share the mathematical dream with us.
If you would take polls, the top three answers might be: love, wine and whining.
But let me suggest a fourth one: mathematics.
And if you look at the statistics of the Fields Medal, often called the Nobel Prize for mathematics, and always awarded to mathematicians below the age of 40, you will find that France has more Fields medalists per inhabitant than any other country.
What is it that we find so sexy in math?
It is about imagination, the talent which we most praise.
But noted that this feeling can last for hours, or even days.
The reward may be big.
For instance, Einstein, Perrin, Smoluchowski, they used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories and the Gauss Curve to explain and prove that our world is made of atoms.
In those days, only a small fraction of the world had been explored, and the Earth might have seemed infinite.

Now with all this beauty, usefulness and wealth, mathematics does look more sexy.
But don't you think that the life a mathematical researcher is an easy one.
It is filled with perplexity, frustration, a desperate fight for understanding.
Let me evoke for you one of the most striking days in my mathematician's life.
Or should I say, one of the most striking nights.
At that time, I was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton -- for many years, the home of Albert Einstein and arguably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world.
And that night I was working and working on an elusive proof, which was incomplete.
It was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas, which are a crowd of electrons.
In the perfect world of plasma, there are no collisions and no friction to provide the stability like we are used to.
But still, if you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium, you will find that the resulting electric field spontaneously vanishes, or damps out, as if by some mysterious friction force.
This paradoxical effect, called the Landau damping, is one of the most important in plasma physics, and it was discovered through mathematical ideas.
But still, a full mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was missing.
And together with my former student and main collaborator Clément Mouhot, in Paris at the time, we had been working for months and months on such a proof.
Actually, I had already announced by mistake that we could solve it.
But the truth is, the proof was just not working.
In spite of more than 100 pages of complicated, mathematical arguments, and a bunch discoveries, and huge calculation, it was not working.
And that night in Princeton, a certain gap in the chain of arguments was driving me crazy.
I was putting in there all my energy and experience and tricks, and still nothing was working.
1 a. m. , 2 a. m. , 3 a. m. , not working.
Around 4 a. m. , I go to bed in low spirits.
Then a few hours later, waking up and go, "Ah, it's time to get the kids to school --" What is this?
There was this voice in my head, I swear.
"Take the second term to the other side, Fourier transform and invert in L2." (Laughter) Damn it, that was the start of the solution!
You see, I thought I had taken some rest, but really my brain had continued to work on it.
In those moments, you don't think of your career or your colleagues, it's just a complete battle between the problem and you.
That being said, it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work.
What do you think, on such an occasion?
Pride, yes?
And gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible.
And because it was a collective adventure, you need to share it, not just with your collaborators.
I believe that everybody can appreciate the thrill of mathematical research, and share the passionate stories of humans and ideas behind it.
And I've been working with my staff at Institut Henri Poincaré, together with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide, so that we can found our own, very special museum of mathematics there.
So in a few years, when you come to Paris, after tasting the great, crispy baguette and macaroon, please come and visit us at Institut Henri Poincaré, and share the mathematical dream with us.
Thank you.
I'm driven by pure passion to create photographs that tell stories. Photography can be described as the recording of a single moment frozen within a fraction of time.
Each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes.
But what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph?
What if a photograph could actually collapse time, compressing the best moments of the day and the night seamlessly into one single image?
I've created a concept called "Day to Night" and I believe it's going to change the way you look at the world.
I know it has for me. My process begins by photographing iconic locations, places that are part of what I call our collective memory.
I photograph from a fixed vantage point, and I never move.
I capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes. Photographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours and shooting over 1,500 images, I then choose the best moments of the day and night.
Using time as a guide, I seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph, visualizing our conscious journey with time.
I can take you to Paris for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.
And I can show you the early morning rowers along the River Seine.
And simultaneously, I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.
And in between, I can show you the romance of the City of Light.
And I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata, an event that's actually been taking place since 1498. The boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then.
And an important element that I really want you guys to understand is: this is not a timelapse, this is me photographing throughout the day and the night.
I am a relentless collector of magical moments.
And the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them.
The entire concept came about in 1996. LIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet.
I got to the set and realized: it's a square.
So the only way I could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage of 250 single images.
So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes embracing. And as I pan my camera to the right, I noticed there was a mirror on the wall and I saw they were actually reflecting in it.
And for that one moment, that one image I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss for this one picture?
" And then I came back to my studio in New York, and I hand-glued these 250 images together and stood back and went, "Wow, this is so cool!
I'm changing time in a photograph.
" And that concept actually stayed with me for 13 years until technology finally has caught up to my dreams.
This is an image I created of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.
And I'm going to show you a little video that gives you an idea of what it's like being with me when I do these pictures.
To start with, you have to understand that to get views like this, most of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker or a crane.
So this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, non-stop capturing the entire day unfold.
One of the things that's great is I love to people-watch.
And trust me when I tell you, this is the greatest seat in the house to have.
But this is really how I go about creating these photographs.
So once I decide on my view and the location, I have to decide where day begins and night ends.
And that's what I call the time vector.
Einstein described time as a fabric.
Think of the surface of a trampoline: it warps and stretches with gravity.
I see time as a fabric as well, except I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into single plane.
One of the unique aspects of this work is also, if you look at all my pictures, the time vector changes: sometimes I'll go left to right, sometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally.
I am exploring the space-time continuum within a two-dimensional still photograph.
Now when I do these pictures, it's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind.
I build a photograph based on time, and this is what I call the master plate.
This can take us several months to complete.
The fun thing about this work is I have absolutely zero control when I get up there on any given day and capture photographs.
So I never know who's going to be in the picture, if it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset -- no control.
It's at the end of the process, if I've had a really great day and everything remained the same, that I then decide who's in and who's out, and it's all based on time.
I'll take those best moments that I pick over a month of editing and they get seamlessly blended into the master plate. I'm compressing the day and night as I saw it, creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds.
Painting has always been a really important influence in all my work and I've always been a huge fan of Albert Bierstadt, the great Hudson River School painter.
He inspired a recent series that I did on the National Parks.
This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.
So this is the photograph I created of Yosemite.
This is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic.
I photographed for over 30 hours in this picture.
I was literally on the side of a cliff, capturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions, the moonlight lighting El Capitan.
And I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape.
The best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed -- from day into night.
And on a personal note, I actually had a photocopy of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.
And when that sun started to rise in the valley, I started to literally shake with excitement because I looked at the painting and I go, "Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting 100 years earlier.
" Day to Night is about all the things, it's like a compilation of all the things I love about the medium of photography.
They feel like a giant school of fish, it was a form of emergent behavior.
And when people describe the energy of New York, I think this photograph begins to really capture that.
When you look closer in my work, you can see there's stories going on.
So I decided, in this photograph, I would checkerboard time. So wherever the shadows are, it's night and wherever the sun is, it's actually day.
Time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around.
This was a perfect example. 
I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie.
They would walk up, take a picture, and then walk away.
Unfortunately, when we got there, there was a drought going on during the peak migration, a five-week drought.
When I created this picture, I realized that Day to Night is really a new way of seeing, compressing time, exploring the space-time continuum within a photograph.
(Applause)
Most recently, I visited the icy coast of Greenland and the low-lying islands of the Maldives, connecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered parts of our planet.
Behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else.
The melting glaciers in Greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels, which have already begun to drown some of our world's lowest-lying islands.
When I was in Greenland, I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice.
And it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months.
His corneas would go to Schepens Eye Research Institute, which is part of Harvard Medical School, and his retinas would go to the University of Pennsylvania.
But I did find myself wondering, what's happening now?
She thanked me for the donation, and she explained that she is studying retinoblastoma, which is a deadly cancer of the retina that affects children under the age of five, and she said that yes, we were invited to visit her lab.
So next we talked on the phone, and one of the first things she said to me was that she couldn't possibly imagine how we felt, and that Thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice, and that she seemed to feel indebted to us.
So I said, "Nothing against your study, but we didn't actually pick it.
We donated to the system, and the system chose your study.
I said, "And second of all, bad things happen to children every day, and if you didn't want these retinas, they would probably be buried in the ground right now.
So to be able to participate in your study gives Thomas's life a new layer of meaning.
So, never feel guilty about using this tissue.
" Next, she explained to me how rare it was.
She had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier with the National Disease Research Interchange.
She got only one sample of tissue that fit her criteria, and it was Thomas's.
Next, we arranged a date for me to come visit the lab, and we chose March 23, 2015, which was the twins' fifth birthday.
After we hung up, I emailed her some pictures of Thomas and Callum, and a few weeks later, we received this T-shirt in the mail.
A few months later, Ross, Callum and I piled in the car and we went for a road trip.
We met Arupa and her staff, and Arupa said that when I told her not to feel guilty, that it was a relief, and that she hadn't seen it from our perspective.
She also explained that Thomas had a secret code name.
The same way Henrietta Lacks is called HeLa, Thomas was called RES 360. RES means research, and 360 means he was the 360th specimen over the course of about 10 years.
She also shared with us a unique document, and it was the shipping label that sent his retinas from DC to Philadelphia.
This shipping label is like an heirloom to us now.
It's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate might be.
She said she saved it because she doesn't know when she might get more.
After this, we went to the conference room and we relaxed and we had lunch together, and the lab staff presented Callum with a birthday gift.
It was a child's lab kit.
And they also offered him an internship.
(Laughter) So in closing, I have two simple messages today. One is that most of us probably don't think about donating to research.
I know I didn't.
I think I'm a normal person.
But I did it.
It was a good experience, and I recommend it, and it brought my family a lot of peace.
And second is if you work with human tissue and you wonder about the donor and about the family, write them a letter.
Tell them you received it, tell them what you're working on, and invite them to visit your lab, because that visit may be even more gratifying for you than it is for them.
And I'd also like to ask you a favor. 
If you're ever successful in arranging one of these visits, please tell me about it.
The other part of my family's story is that we ended up visiting all four facilities that received Thomas's donations.
And we met amazing people doing inspiring work.
The way I see it now is that Thomas got into Harvard, Duke and Penn -- (Laughter) And he has a job at Cytonet, and he has colleagues and he has coworkers who are in the top of their fields.
And they need him in order to do their job.
And a life that once seemed brief and insignificant revealed itself to be vital, everlasting and relevant.
And I only hope that my life can be as relevant.
Thank you.
(Applause)I was three months pregnant with twins when my husband Ross and I went to my second sonogram.
I was 35 years old at the time, and I knew that that meant we had a higher risk of having a child with a birth defect.
So, Ross and I researched the standard birth defects, and we felt reasonably prepared.
Well, nothing would have prepared us for the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face.
The doctor explained that one of our twins, Thomas, had a fatal birth defect called anencephaly.
This means that his brain was not formed correctly because part of his skull was missing.
Babies with this diagnosis typically die in utero or within a few minutes, hours or days of being born.
But the other twin, Callum, appeared to be healthy, as far as the doctor could tell, and these twins were identical, genetically identical.
So after a lot of questions about how this could have possibly happened, a selective reduction was mentioned, and while this procedure was not impossible, it posed some unique risks for the healthy twin and for me, so we decided to carry the pregnancy to term.
So there I was, three months pregnant, with two trimesters ahead of me, and I had to find a way to manage my blood pressure and my stress.
And it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months.
But I stared down the barrel of that gun for so long that I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
While there was nothing we could do to prevent the tragedy, I wanted to find a way for Thomas's brief life to have some kind of positive impact.
So I asked my nurse about organ, eye and tissue donation.
She connected with our local organ-procurement organization, the Washington Regional Transplant Community. WRTC explained to me that Thomas would probably be too small at birth to donate for transplant, and I was shocked: I didn't even know you could be rejected for that.
But they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research.
This helped me see Thomas in a new light.
As opposed to just a victim of a disease, I started to see him as a possible key to unlock a medical mystery.
On March 23, 2010, the twins were born, and they were both born alive.
And just like the doctor said, Thomas was missing the top part of his skull, but he could nurse, drink from a bottle, cuddle and grab our fingers like a normal baby, and he slept in our arms.
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms surrounded by our family.
We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home and brought him to Children's National Medical Center.
A few hours later, we got a call to say that the recovery was a success, and Thomas's donations would be going to four different places.
His cord blood would go to Duke University.
His liver would go to a cell-therapy company called Cytonet in Durham.
His corneas would go to Schepens Eye Research Institute, which is part of Harvard Medical School, and his retinas would go to the University of Pennsylvania.
A few days later, we had a funeral with our immediate family, including baby Callum, and we basically closed this chapter in our lives.
But I did find myself wondering, what's happening now?
What are the researchers learning?
And was it even worthwhile to donate?
WRTC invited Ross and I to a grief retreat, and we met about 15 other grieving families who had donated their loved one's organs for transplant.
Some of them had even received letters from the people who received their loved one's organs, saying thank you.
I learned that they could even meet each other if they'd both sign a waiver, almost like an open adoption.
And I was so excited, I thought maybe I could write a letter or I could get a letter and learn about what happened.
But I was disappointed to learn that this process only exists for people who donate for transplant.
So I was jealous.
I had transplant envy, I guess.
(Laughter) But over the years that followed, I learned a lot more about donation, and I even got a job in the field.
And I came up with an idea.
I wrote a letter that started out, "Dear Researcher.
" I explained who I was, and I asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas in March of 2010, and I asked if my family could visit their lab.
I emailed it to the eye bank that arranged the donation, the Old Dominion Eye Foundation, and asked if they could send it to the right person.
They said that they had never done this before, and they couldn't guarantee a response, but they wouldn't be an obstacle, and they would deliver it.
Two days later, I got a response from Dr. Arupa Ganguly of the University of Pennsylvania.
She thanked me for the donation, and she explained that she is studying retinoblastoma, which is a deadly cancer of the retina that affects children under the age of five, and she said that yes, we were invited to visit her lab.
So next we talked on the phone, and one of the first things she said to me was that she couldn't possibly imagine how we felt, and that Thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice, and that she seemed to feel indebted to us.
So I said, "Nothing against your study, but we didn't actually pick it.

How much do you need to know about a person before you'd feel comfortable making a loan?
Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars to the person sitting two rows behind you.
What would you need to know about that person before you'd feel comfortable?
My mom came to the US from India in her late thirties.
She's a doctor in Brooklyn, and she often lets friends and neighbors come to see her for health services, whether they can pay right away or not.
Most of us are like my mom.
We would give credit to someone we know or that we live next to.
But most of us are probably not going to lend to a stranger unless we know a little something about them.
Banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions don't know us on a personal level, but they do have a way of trusting us, and that's through our credit scores.
But . . . there are 2.5 billion people around the world that don't have a credit score.
That's a third of the world's population.
They don't have a score because there are no formal public records on them -- no bank accounts, no credit histories and no social security numbers.
And because they don't have a score, they don't have access to the credit or financial products that can improve their lives.
They are not trusted.
So we wanted to find a way to build trust and to open up financial access for these 2.5 billion.
So we created a mobile application that builds credit scores for them using mobile data.
They're texting their friends, they're looking up directions, they're browsing the Internet and they're even making financial transactions.
Over time, this data is getting captured on our phones, and it provides a really rich picture of a person's life.
Our customers give us access to this data and we capture it through our mobile application.
It helps us understand the creditworthiness of people like Jenipher, a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.
Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decades has been running a food stall in the central business district.
She has three sons who she put through vocational school, and she's also the leader of her local chama, or savings group.
Jenipher's food stall does well.
She makes just enough every day to cover her expenses.
But she's not financially secure.
Any emergency could force her into debt.
And she has no discretionary income to improve her family's way of living, for emergencies, or for investing into growing her business.
If Jenipher wants credit, her options are limited.
She could get a microloan, but she'd have to form a group that could help vouch for her credibility.
And even then, the loan sizes would be way too small to really have an impact on her business, averaging around 150 dollars.
Loan sharks are always an option, but with interest rates that are well above 300 percent, they're financially risky.
And because Jenipher doesn't have collateral or a credit history, she can't walk into a bank and ask for a business loan.
But one day, Jenipher's son convinced her to download our application and apply for a loan.
Jenipher answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device.
And here's what we saw.
So, bad news first.
Jenipher had a low savings balance and no previous loan history.
These are factors that would have thrown up a red flag to a traditional bank.
But there were other points in her history that showed us a much richer picture of her potential.
So for one, we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda.
Well, it turns out that the data shows a four percent increase in repayment among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts.
We could also see that though she traveled around a lot throughout the day, she actually had pretty regular travel patterns, and she was either at home or at her food stall.
And the data shows a six percent increase in repayment among customers who are consistent with where they spend most of their time.
We could also see that she communicated a lot with many different people throughout the day and that she had a strong support network.
Our data shows that people who communicate with more than 58 different contacts tend to be more likely to be good borrowers.
In Jenipher's case, she communicated with 89 different individuals, which showed a nine percent increase in her repayment.
These are just some of the thousands of different data points that we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness.
And after analyzing all of these different data points, we took the first risk and gave Jenipher a loan.
This is data that would not be found on a paper trail or in any formal financial record.
But it proves trust.
By looking beyond income, we can see that people in emerging markets that may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface are actually willing and have the capacity to repay.
Our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya in just the past year. And our repayment rates are above 90 percent -- which, by the way, is in line with traditional bank repayment rates.
With something as simple as a credit score, we're giving people the power to build their own futures.
Our customers have used their loans for family expenses, emergencies, travel and for investing back into growing their businesses.
They're now building better economies and communities where more people can succeed.
Over the past two years of using our product, Jenipher has increased her savings by 60 percent.
She's also started two additional food stalls and is now making plans for her own restaurant.
She's applying for a small-business loan from a commercial bank, because she now has the credit history to prove she deserves it.
I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week, and she told me how excited she was to get started.
She said, "Only my son believed I could do this.
I didn't think this was for me.
" She's lived her whole life believing that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her.
Our job now is to open the world to Jenipher and the billions like her that deserve to be trusted.
Thank you.

[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.

] [We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.
] This week, there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of 11 million documents from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca.
The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world.
We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say, "OK, we want an anonymous company, can you give us one?
" So you actually get to see the emails, you get to see the exchanges of messages, you get to see the mechanics of how this works, how this operates.
Now, this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions.
The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.
We've also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has also got offshore companies.
There's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend, who happens to be a top cellist.
And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents.
Now, this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems very distant from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should we care about this?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should, it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare, education, roads.
And that affects all of us.
Now, for my organization Global Witness, this exposé has been phenomenal.
We have the world's media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade.
Now, I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing, and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works.
I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll.
So you can have one company stacked inside another company, stacked inside another company, making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities, journalists, civil society to really understand what's going on.
I also think it's interesting that there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States.
And that's perhaps because some prominent US people just haven't figured in this exposé, in this scandal.
Now, that's not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore.
It's just because of the way in which offshore works, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.
I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada, you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans.
In fact, in a number of US states you need less information, you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card.
That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.
It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors.
This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.
Now, at Global Witness, we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice.
How does this actually work?
So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms.
Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.
Now, what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds.
These were all preliminary meetings, and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands, but it really shows the problem with the system.
It's also important to not just think about this as individual cases.
This is not just about an individual lawyer who's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions.
It's not just about a particular senior politician who's been caught up in a scandal.
This is about how a system works, that entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.
And in order to tackle this, we need to change the game.
We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder.
This may seem like doom and gloom, like there's nothing we can do about it, like nothing has ever changed, like there will always be rich and powerful individuals.
But as a natural optimist, I do see that we are starting to get some change.
Over the last couple of years, we've seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership.
One of the things that is sad is that, actually, the US is lagging behind.
There's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the House and the Senate, but it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see.
So we'd really want to see the Panama leaks, this huge peek into the offshore world, be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies.
We need business leaders to stand up and say, "Secrecy like this is not good for business.
" We need political leaders to recognize the problem, and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.
Together, we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion, corruption, money laundering to flourish.[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.

I'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good.
And so we did.
With the option to create a secure, timestamped document of what happened to them, preserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet.
And lastly, and perhaps most critically, with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant.
You see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything.
It changes the way you frame your own experience, it changes the way you think about your perpetrator, it means that if you do come forward, you'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours.
We created a website that actually does this and we launched it [. . . ] in August, on two college campuses.
If a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers, it's more likely that they would have reported, that they would have been believed, and that Mike would have been kicked off campus, gone to jail, or at least gotten the help that he needed.
And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike after just their second assault following a match, survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place.
We could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on.
And because we're creating a real deterrent to assault, for perhaps the first time, maybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone.
The type of system I'm describing, the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow, meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met, such as a match.
The application that we built is for college campuses.
But the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace.
We don't have to live in a world where 99 percent of rapists get away with it.
We can create one where those who do wrong are held accountable, where survivors get the support and justice they deserve, where the authorities get the information they need, and where there's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being.
Thank you.
(Applause)Hannah is excited to be going to college. She couldn't wait to get out of her parents' house, to prove to them that she's an adult, and to prove to her new friends that she belongs.
She heads to a campus party where she sees a guy that she has a crush on. Let's call him Mike.
The next day, Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache.
She can only remember the night in flashes.
But what she does remember is throwing up in the hall outside Mike's room and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her, wanting it to stop, then shakily stumbling home.
She doesn't feel good about what happened, but she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex in college is?
" One in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted at some point during their college career in the United States.
Less than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school or to the police.
And those who do, on average, wait 11 months to make the report.
Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own.
But when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties, she's worried about them.
After graduation, Hannah learns that she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to.
And this is not an unlikely scenario because 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders.
But with such low reporting rates, it's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported, much less anything happen if they are.
In fact, only six percent of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison.
Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance that they'll get away with it.
This means there's practically no deterrent to assault in the United States.
Now, I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training.
I'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good.
So this, to me, is a tragic but a solvable problem.
So when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago, it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change.
And so we did.
We started by talking to college survivors.
With the option to create a secure, timestamped document of what happened to them, preserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet.
And lastly, and perhaps most critically, with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant.
You see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything.
It changes the way you frame your own experience, it changes the way you think about your perpetrator, it means that if you do come forward, you'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours.

And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike after just their second assault following a match, survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place.
The type of system I'm describing, the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow, meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met, such as a match.
Thank you.

How hard could it be to walk up the stairs?
No big deal, right?
But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months?
Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.
[This is a perfect time to get some work done. ] [Nope!
Sorry!" (Sigh) Now, what is going on here?
Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?
Why are all of these people in such a dark place?
How hard could it be to walk up the stairs?

Why are all of these people in such a dark place?
In India, we have these huge families.
But then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health.
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.
He was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes.
And he's not the only one in the world. Every year, 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's, and this number is only rising.
As designers, we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems, one solution that solves it all, but it need not always be like that.
So my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's, but to make their everyday tasks much more simple, and then make an impact. Well, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right?
Well, I was too.
(Applause)In India, we have these huge families.
And a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him, but the one that finally worked was this one.Let's take a look. (Laughter) (Applause) He walked faster, right?
Let's make a smarter world, but with simplicity. Thank you.
(Applause)
You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Arua, Nigeria. But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.
In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: Lassa virus.
Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.
It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal.
But these individuals, they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and by doing so, protect us all.
But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning -- these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines -- by singing.
They gather together, and they show their joy.
They show their spirit.
And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important, even essential, as things begin to change.
And that changed a great deal in March of 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And it was frightening, frightening for us all.
We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought, and we thought it could one day come to Kenema.
And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone.
We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is outstanding.
We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital, and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an exceptional work that was done.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on.
With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
We all have one.
The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.
Well, that was not going to work at this point, right?
So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequences came off the machines, we published it to the web.
We just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us.
And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records, we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accuracy.
So we were waiting for more data to release that.
and the data has still not come.
We are still waiting, tweaking away, in silos rather than working together.
And this just -- we can't accept that.
Right?
You, all of you, cannot accept that.
It's our lives on the line.
And in fact, actually, many lives were lost, many health-care workers, including beloved colleagues of mine, five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five of many health-care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and separately.
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division.
When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thrives.
But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same.
We're all in this fight together.
Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours.
And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we work together with joy.
" That was really profound for us, because without knowing it, we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together.
And we have to do that.
We all have to demand that of ourselves and others -- to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait, like Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there.
It could be something that's transmitted through the air.
It could even be disseminated intentionally.
And I know that that is frightening, I understand that, but I know also, and this experience shows us, that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing, to win this and have the upper hand over viruses.
But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always, let us be in this fight with them always.
And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
(Applause)You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Arua, Nigeria. But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.

This was an exceptional work that was done.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on.
It could've stopped something.
But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months.
And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing.
From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can discard it, obviously.
The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is the blueprint -- the genome of a virus is the blueprint.
We all have one.
It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information.
The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.
Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is contact tracing.
We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating.
And each of those mutations are so important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally -- that's what drives it.
And so global health experts would need to respond, would have to develop, to recalibrate everything that they were doing.
That's the way the status quo works.
Well, that was not going to work at this point, right?
We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help, lots of help.
So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequences came off the machines, we published it to the web.
We just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us.
" And help came.
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and released.
Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community.
We were working together in this virtual way, sharing, regular calls, communications, trying to follow the virus minute by minute, to see ways that we could stop it.
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally, was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage.
Everybody wants to play a part.
The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing, and the Internet connects us all.
And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other, that we all just said, "Let's do this.
" But the problem is that the data that all of us are using, Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do.
And so many opportunities get missed when that happens.
So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema, we'd had 106 clinical records from patients, and we once again made that publicly available to the world.
And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records, we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accuracy.
And we made an app that could release that, to make that available to health-care workers in the field.
So we were waiting for more data to release that.
and the data has still not come.
Right?
You, all of you, cannot accept that.
It's our lives on the line.
And in fact, actually, many lives were lost, many health-care workers, including beloved colleagues of mine, five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah.

" When you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction.And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria, the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma, And when you hear that, you think of death. 
It literally translates to "death to mother and child.
We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food.
And preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops. The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agriculture is rainfed.
Now, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world.
So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents.
They tend to be small, very attractive, but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly. Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs.
And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals.Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies.
Up the west coast of my country, for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth.
But come the spring rains, you get this: flowering of the desert. The strategy in annuals, is to grow only in the rainy season.
It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land.
And this is a really rare phenomenon.
There are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this.
I'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process of these three species in that order. And at the bottom, there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens. (Applause) Pretty amazing, huh?
So I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this. How do these plants dry without dying?
And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants, shown here in the hydrated and dry states, for a number of reasons.
The other reason for looking at a number of plants, is that, at least initially, I wanted to find out: do they do the same thing?
Do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die?
So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance, in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level.
I'm sure some of you are thinking, "By biotic application, does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?
" And the answer to that question is: depends on your definition of genetic modification. All of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize, are highly genetically modified from their ancestors, but we don't consider them GM because they're being produced by conventional breeding.
If you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops, your answer is yes. In the essence of time, we have tried that approach.
After three weeks without watering, the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better.Now to the final approach.My research has shown that there's considerable similarity in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants.So I ask the question, are they using the same genes?
Or slightly differently phrased, are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves?
Have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants?
(Applause)
I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists.
I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess.
But I know that it's there.
And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it.
On our planet, where there's water, there's life.
So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars.
At this distance, shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures, planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside.
Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars.
What I do picks up where their job ends.
I model the possible climates of exoplanets.
And here's why that's important: there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life.
Take the planet Venus.
It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky.
But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story.
The surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, 500 Celsius.
That's hot enough to melt lead.
Its thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason. It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids, trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface.
The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet.
From these lessons from our own solar system, we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life.
We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us.
For example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water -- it's called Gliese 667 Cc -- such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name -- it's 23 light years away.
So that's more than 100 trillion miles.
Trying to measure the atmospheric composition of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard.
It's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight.
OK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away, and you want to know the precise color of that fly.
So I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life.
Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler-62f, with the Earth for reference.
It's 1,200 light years away, and just 40 percent larger than Earth.
Our NSF-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit.
So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life.
Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate.
Ice absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light, and reflects shorter, bluer light.
That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue.
The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice.
Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom.
Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice.
My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars.
There's another contradiction -- that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars, and that light, that energy, heats the ice.
Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere.
And it's no surprise that this is my specialty.
I'm an African-American female astronomer and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines, so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature -- (Laughter) (Applause) . . . and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists.
My organization, Rising Stargirls, teaches astronomy to middle-school girls of color, using theater, writing and visual art.
Thank you.
(Applause)I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists.
I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess.
But I know that it's there.
And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it.
So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars.
Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars.
I model the possible climates of exoplanets.
It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky.
But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story.
The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet.
From these lessons from our own solar system, we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life.
We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us.
For example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water -- it's called Gliese 667 Cc -- such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name -- it's 23 light years away.
OK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away, and you want to know the precise color of that fly.
Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate.
Thank you.
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy? We did that.
I mean it's, "I have my friends, therefore I am.
I mean, it's nice -- LT: Thank you.
LT: No, I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me. (Laughter) JF: I'm showing you the way. (Laughter) LT: Well, you are and you have.
JF: Do you do emojis?
LT: Oh . . . JF: No?
LT: That's embarrassing.
JF: I'm really into emojis.
LT: No, I spell out my -- I spell out my words of happiness and congratulations, and sadness. JF: You spell it right out -- LT: I spell it, every letter.
LT: I was grateful.
(Laughter) PM: And -- LT: Wait, no, it's really important because this is another example of how women are overlooked, put aside, marginalized.
There's been very little research done on us, even though we volunteered lots of times.
JF: That's for sure.
(Laughter) LT: This is really exciting, and you all will be interested in this.
The Harvard Medical School study has shown that women who have close female friendships are less likely to develop impairments -- physical impairments as they age, and they are likely to be seen to be living much more vital, exciting -- JF: And longer -- LT: Joyful lives.
JF: We live five years longer than men. LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.
(Laughter) LT: But the most important part is they found -- the results were so exciting and so conclusive -- the researchers found that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health, as much as smoking or being overweight.
JF: And there's something else, too -- LT: I've said my part, so . . . (Laughter) JF: OK, well, listen to my part, because there's an additional thing.
Because they only -- for years, decades -- they only researched men when they were trying to understand stress, only very recently have they researched what happens to women when we're stressed, and it turns out that when we're stressed -- women, our bodies get flooded by oxytocin.
Which is a feel-good, calming, stress-reducing hormone.
Which is also increased when we're with our women friends.
And I do think that's one reason why we live longer.
And I feel so bad for men because they don't have that. Testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin.
LT: Well, when you and I and Dolly made "9 to 5" . . . JF: Oh -- LT: We laughed, we did, we laughed so much, we found we had so much in common and we're so different.
JF: I think -- we sure crossed our legs a lot.
(Laughter) If you know what I mean. LT: I think we all know what you mean.
(Laughter) PM: You're adding decades to our lives right now.
So among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship was one by a woman we admire greatly, Sister Joan Chittister, who said about female friendship that women friends are not just a social act, they're a spiritual act.
Do you think of your friends as spiritual?
Do they add something spiritual to your lives?
LT: Spiritual -- I absolutely think that.
Because -- especially people you've known a long time, people you've spent time with -- I can see the spiritual essence inside them, the tenderness, the vulnerability. There's actually kind of a love, an element of love in the relationship.
I just see deeply into your soul.
PM: Do you think that, Jane -- LT: But I have special powers. JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.
There's business friends, and party friends, I've got a lot of those.
(Laughter) But the oxytocin-producing friendships have . . . They feel spiritual because it's a heart opening, right?
You know, we go deep.
And -- I find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends.
Not because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them.
LT: And you know one of you is going to go soon.
(Laughter) PM: Well, two of us are sitting here, Lily, which one are you talking about?
(Laughter) And I always think, when women talk about their friendships, that men always look a little mystified.
What are the differences, in your opinion, between men friendships and women friendships?
JF: There's a lot of difference, and I think we have to have a lot of empathy for men -- (Laughter) that they don't have what we have.
Which I think may be why they die sooner.
(Laughter) I have a lot of compassion for men, because women, no kidding, we -- women's relationships, our friendships are full disclosure, we go deep.
They're revelatory.
We risk vulnerability -- this is something men don't do.
I mean how many times have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?
" "Did I really screw up there?
LT: I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions, they want to bury deeper feelings.
I mean, that's the general, conventional thought.
They would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls, or talk about sports, or hunting, or cars or have sex.
I mean, it's just the kind of -- it's a more manly behavior. JF: You meant -- LT: They talk about sex.
They need relationship.
So the question is why, as they grow older, does that change?
And the answer is patriarchal culture, which says to boys and young men that to be needing of relationship, to be emotional with someone is girly.
That a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need, they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.
They don't ask for help.
There's a quote that I really like, "Men fear that becoming 'we' will erase his 'I'. " You know, his sense of self.
Whereas women's sense of self has always been kind of porous.
But our "we" is our saving grace, it's what makes us strong.
It's not that we're better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove.
LT: And, well -- JF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote. So we can express our humanity -- LT: I know who Gloria Steinem is. JF: I know you know who she is, but I think it's a -- (Laughter) No, but it's a great quote, I think.
We're not better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove.
And that's really important.
LT: But men are so inculcated in the culture to be comfortable in the patriarchy.
And we've got to make something different happen.
JF: Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power. LT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject.
It's because our friendships -- female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood, and sisterhood can be a very powerful force, to give the world -- to make it what it should be -- the things that humans desperately need.
PM: It is why we're talking about it, because women's friendships are, as you said, Jane, a renewable source of power.
So how do we use that power?
JF: Well, women are the fastest growing demographic in the world, especially older women.
And if we harness our power, we can change the world.
And guess what?
We need to. (Applause) And we need to do it soon. And one of the things that we need to do -- and we can do it as women -- for one thing, we kind of set the consumer standards.
We need to consume less.
We in the Western world need to consume less and when we buy things, we need to buy things that are made locally, when we buy food, we need to buy food that's grown locally.
We are the ones that need to get off the grid.
We need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels.
And the fossil fuel companies -- the Exxons and the Shell Oils and those bad guys -- cause they are -- are going to tell us that we can't do it without going back to the Stone Age.
You know, that the alternatives just aren't quite there yet, and that's not true.
There are countries in the world right now that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine.
And they tell us that if we do wean ourselves from fossil fuel that we're going to be back in the Stone Age, and in fact, if we begin to use renewable energy, and not drill in the Arctic, and not drill -- LT: Oh, boy.
JF: And not drill in the Alberta tar sands -- Right.
That we will be -- there will be more democracy and more jobs and more well-being, and it's women that are going to lead the way.
LT: Maybe we have the momentum to start a third-wave feminist movement with our sisterhood around the world, with women we don't see, women we may never meet, but we join together that way, because -- Aristotle said -- most people -- people would die without male friendships.
And the operative word here was "male.
" Because they thought that friendships should be between equals and women were not considered equal -- JF: They didn't think we had souls even, the Greeks. LT: No, exactly.
That shows you just how limited Aristotle was.
(Laughter) And wait, no, here's the best part.
It's like, you know, men do need women now.
The planet needs women.
The US Constitution needs women.
We are not even in the Constitution.
JF: You're talking about the Equal Rights Amendment.
LT: Right.
Justice Ginsberg said something like -- every constitution that's been written since the end of World War II included a provision that made women citizens of equal stature, but ours does not.
So that would be a good place to start.
Very, very mild -- JF: Right.
(Applause) And gender equality, it's like a tide, it would lift all boats, not just women. PM: Needing new role models on how to do that.
How to be friends, how to think about our power in different ways, as consumers, as citizens of the world, and this is what makes Jane and Lily a role model of how women can be friends -- for a very long time, and even if they occasionally disagree.
Thank you. Thank you both.
(Laughter) JF: You're taking up our time.
(Laughter) (Applause) JF: You know, I was thinking this morning, I don't even know what I would do without my women friends.
And most of them are a good deal younger than me, too.
I'm approaching -- I'll be there sooner than you.
LT: Oh . . . JF: No?
LT: That's embarrassing.
JF: We live five years longer than men. LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.
(Laughter) LT: But the most important part is they found -- the results were so exciting and so conclusive -- the researchers found that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health, as much as smoking or being overweight.

" "Did I really screw up there?
" PM: You're doing great. (Laughter) JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that of our women friends, and men don't.
You know, people describe women's relationships as face-to-face, whereas men's friendships are more side-by-side.
LT: I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions, they want to bury deeper feelings.
I mean, that's the general, conventional thought.
They would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls, or talk about sports, or hunting, or cars or have sex.
I mean, it's just the kind of -- it's a more manly behavior. JF: You meant -- LT: They talk about sex.
If you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls, you'll see the baby boys just like the girls, gazing into their mother's eyes, you know, needing that relational exchange of energy.
When the mother looks away, they could see the dismay on the child, even the boy would cry.
They need relationship.
So the question is why, as they grow older, does that change?
And the answer is patriarchal culture, which says to boys and young men that to be needing of relationship, to be emotional with someone is girly.
That a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need, they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.

In the past few months, I've been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes.
One day, I was invited to an important event, and I wanted to wear something special and new for it.
So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear.
I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day, and I had access to 3D printers.
So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer, and I loaded the file on the printer.
It just printed the pieces overnight.
The next morning, I just took all the pieces, assembled them together in my hotel room, and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now.
(Applause) So it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes.
For my senior collection at fashion design school, I decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home.
The problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing, and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks.
I always felt most creative when I worked from home.
I loved experimenting with new materials, and I always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects.
I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials, and then bring them home to experiment on.
As you can probably imagine, my roommates didn't like that at all.
(Laughter) So I decided to move on to working with big machines, ones that didn't fit in my living room.
I love the exact and the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies, like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing.
One summer break, I came here to New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown.
We worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed.
They were amazing -- like you can see here.
But I had a few issues with them.
They were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable. The models couldn't sit in them, and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms.
With 3D printing, the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted, but still, they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio.
Later that year, a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace, printed using a home printer.
I knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship.
So I looked at the necklace, and then I thought, "If I can print a necklace from home, why not print my clothes from home, too?
" I really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell -- I could just design them and print them directly from home.
I found a small makerspace, where I learned everything I know about 3D printing.
Right away, they literally gave me the key to the lab, so I could experiment into the night, every night.
The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with. So what is a filament?
Filament is the material you feed the printer with.
And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA, which is a hard and scratchy, breakable material. The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex, which is a new kind of filament.
It's strong, yet very flexible.
And with it, I was able to print the first garment, the red jacket that had the word "Liberté" -- "freedom" in French -- embedded into it.
I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free when I could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself.
And actually, you can easily download this jacket, and easily change the word to something else.
For example, your name or your sweetheart's name.
(Laughter) So the printer plates are small, so I had to piece the garment together, just like a puzzle.
And I wanted to solve another challenge.
I wanted to print textiles that I would use just like regular fabrics.
That's when I found an open-source file from an architect who designed a pattern that I love.
And with it, I was able to print a beautiful textile that I would use just like a regular fabric.
And it actually even looks a little bit like lace.
So I took his file and I modified it, and changed it, played with it -- many kinds of versions out of it. And I needed to print another 1,500 more hours to complete printing my collection.
So you guys, you want to see what it looks like?
Audience: Yeah!
(Applause) Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits.
Almost everything here she's wearing, I printed from my home.
Even her shoes are printed.
Audience: Wow!
Audience: Cool!
(Applause) Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca. (To audience) Thank you, guys.
So I think in the future, materials will evolve, and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today, like cotton or silk.
Imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements.
Music was once a very physical thing. You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs, but now you can just download the music -- digital music -- directly to your phone.
Fashion is also a very physical thing. And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital, just like this skirt is.
Thank you so much. (Applause) [Thank You] (Applause)
Now. . . let's go back in time.
The West had corrupted me with divergent ideas, and if only my parents had never left Taiwan, this would not have happened to their only daughter.
In truth, I wondered if they were right.
Of course, there are gay people in Asia, just as there are gay people in every part of the world.
But is the idea of living an "out" life, in the "I'm gay, this is my spouse, and we're proud of our lives together" kind of way just a Western idea?
If I had grown up in Taiwan, or any place outside of the West, would I have found models of happy, thriving LGBT people?
Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions.
They told me their stories of persecution in their home countries, just for being gay, and the reasons why they escaped to the US.
After 10 years of doing this kind of work, I needed better stories for myself.
So we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the "Supergays.
" (Laughter) These would be the LGBT individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world.
They would be the kind of person that I aspire to be.
Our plan was to share their stories to the world through film.
LD: There was just one problem.
JC: One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal.
One of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.
A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman, Bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school and getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation.
I'm a transgendered person.
Something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don't fit in to people's strict gender expectations.
I had to come up with a strategy, so that I could just pee in peace.
This all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am.
I can't be anything else.
JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.
David had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government.
So he decided to run for senate.
LD: At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina.
María Rachid (Spanish): I always say that, in reality, the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married.
In Shanghai, I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group and tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese.
In Taipei, each time we got onto the metro, we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands.
Turns out, it wasn't hard to find them at all.
LD: One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum, momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world, and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another.
When Argentina embraced marriage equality, Uruguay and Brazil followed.
It wasn't a love story that was expected of me, but it is one filled with more freedom, adventure and love than I could have ever possibly imagined.
And in the end, we believe, love will win out.
They told me their stories of persecution in their home countries, just for being gay, and the reasons why they escaped to the US.
" (Laughter) These would be the LGBT individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world.
They would be courageous, resilient, and most of all, proud of who they were.
They would be the kind of person that I aspire to be.
Our plan was to share their stories to the world through film.
LD: There was just one problem.
We had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience.
(Laughter) We didn't even know where to find the Supergays, so we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way.
So we picked 15 countries in Asia, Africa and South America, countries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights.
We bought a camcorder, ordered a book on how to make a documentary -- (Laughter) you can learn a lot these days -- and set off on an around-the-world trip.
JC: One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal.
Despite widespread poverty, a decade-long civil war, and now recently, a devastating earthquake, Nepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality.
One of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.
A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman, Bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school and getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation.
But, in 2007, Bhumika and Nepal's LGBT rights organization successfully petitioned the Nepali Supreme Court to protect against LGBT discrimination.
Here's Bhumika: (Video) BS: What I'm most proud of?
I'm a transgendered person.
I'm so proud of my life.
On December 21, 2007, the supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government to give transgender identity cards and same-sex marriage.
LD: I can appreciate Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis.
Something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don't fit in to people's strict gender expectations.
Traveling throughout Asia, I tended to freak out women in public restrooms.
They weren't used to seeing someone like me.
I had to come up with a strategy, so that I could just pee in peace.
(Laughter) So anytime I would enter a restroom, I would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts, and try to be as non-threatening as possible.
Putting out my hands and saying, "Hello", just so that people could hear my feminine voice.
This all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am.
I can't be anything else.
JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.
On one hand, India is a Hindu society, without a tradition of homophobia.
On the other hand, it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system, which rejects anything that threatens the male-female order.
When we spoke to activists, they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality, where the women's status is established in society.
And in that way, the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well.
LD: There we met Prince Manvendra.
He's the world's first openly gay prince.
Prince Manvendra came out on the "Oprah Winfrey Show," very internationally.
His parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family.
We sat down with Prince Manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly.
Here he is: (Video) Prince Manvendra: I felt there was a lot of need to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society.
And that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself.
Whether we are gay, we are lesbian, we are transgender, bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from, we have to all unite and fight for our rights.
Gay rights cannot be won in the court rooms, but in the hearts and the minds of the people.
JC: While getting my hair cut, the woman cutting my hair asked me, "Do you have a husband?
" Now, this was a dreaded question that I got asked a lot by locals while traveling.
I told her that there are no limitations to my life and that Lisa and I do plan to have a family some day.
Now, this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy Westerner.
She couldn't imagine that such a phenomenon could happen in her own country.
That is, until I showed her the photos of the Supergays that we interviewed in India.
She recognized Prince Manvendra from television and soon I had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me.
(Laughter) And in that ordinary afternoon, I had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country.
Homosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration.
In Kenya, we met the soft-spoken David Kuria.
David had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government.
So he decided to run for senate.
He became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate.
David wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was.
And, yeah, there are some people out there who do it and they feel that they are doing a religious obligation.
JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was.
Even in the face of threats, he stayed authentic.
LD: At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina.
Argentina's a country where 92 percent of the population identifies as Catholic.
Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive than here in the US.
In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America and the 10th in the world to adopt marriage equality.
There, we met María Rachid.
María was a driving force behind that movement.
María Rachid (Spanish): I always say that, in reality, the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married.
They are for a lot of people that, even though they may never get married, will be perceived differently by their coworkers, their families and neighbors, from the national state's message of equality.
I feel very proud of Argentina because Argentina today is a model of equality.
And hopefully soon, the whole world will have the same rights.
Welcome gays to Shanghai!
(Laughter) A whole community of young, beautiful Chinese LGBT people.
Sure, they had their struggles.
But they were fighting it out.
In Shanghai, I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group and tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese.
In Taipei, each time we got onto the metro, we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands.
And we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live.
If only my parents knew.
LD: By the time we finished our not-so-straight journey around the world, (Laughter) we had traveled 50,000 miles and logged 120 hours of video footage.
We traveled to 15 countries and interviewed 50 Supergays.
Turns out, it wasn't hard to find them at all.
JC: Yes, there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality.
And let's not forget that 75 countries still criminalize homosexuality today.
But there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world.
What we ultimately took away from our journey is, equality is not a Western invention.
LD: One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum, momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world, and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another.
When Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination, India pushed harder.
When Argentina embraced marriage equality, Uruguay and Brazil followed.
When Ireland said yes to equality, (Applause) the world stopped to notice.
When the US Supreme Court makes a statement to the world that we can all be proud of.
(Applause) JC: As we reviewed our footage, what we realized is that we were watching a love story.
It wasn't a love story that was expected of me, but it is one filled with more freedom, adventure and love than I could have ever possibly imagined.
One year after returning home from our trip, marriage equality came to California.
And in the end, we believe, love will win out.
(Video) By the power vested in me, by the state of California and by God Almighty, I now pronounce you spouses for life.
You may kiss.
(Applause)
(Guitar music starts) (Music ends) (Applause) (Distorted guitar music starts) (Music ends) (Applause) (Ambient/guitar music starts) (Music ends) (Applause)(Guitar music starts) (Music ends) (Applause) (Distorted guitar music starts) (Music ends) (Applause) (Ambient/guitar music starts) (Music ends) (Applause)
Every day, I listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives, across dangerous borders and unfriendly seas.
But there's one story that keeps me awake at night, and it's about Doaa.
A Syrian refugee, 19 years old, she was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages.
Her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.
And the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year.
And the community that once welcomed them there had become weary of them.
And one day, men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her.
Once an aspiring student thinking only of her future, now she was scared all the time.
But she was also full of hope, because she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.
Bassem was also struggling in Egypt, and he said to Doaa, "Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.
I will work, you can study -- the promise of a new life.
" And he asked her father for her hand in marriage.
But they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives, traveling across the Mediterranean Sea, putting their hands in smugglers', notorious for their cruelty.
And Doaa was terrified of the water.
She always had been.
She never learned to swim.
It was August that year, and already 2,000 people had died trying to cross the Mediterranean, but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe, and she thought, "Maybe we can, too.
" So she asked her parents if they could go, and after a painful discussion, they consented, and Bassem paid his entire life savings -- 2,500 dollars each -- to the smugglers.
It was a Saturday morning when the call came, and they were taken by bus to a beach, hundreds of people on the beach.
They were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat, 500 of them crammed onto that boat, 300 below, [200] above. There were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims and Christians, 100 children, including Sandra -- little Sandra, six years old -- and Masa, 18 months.
There were families on that boat, crammed together shoulder to shoulder, feet to feet.
Doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest, Bassem holding her hand.
Day two on the water, they were sick with worry and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea.
Day three, Doaa had a premonition.
And she said to Bassem, "I fear we're not going to make it.
I fear the boat is going to sink.
" And Bassem said to her, "Please be patient. We will make it to Sweden, we will get married and we will have a future.
" Day four, the passengers were getting agitated.
They asked the captain, "When will we get there?
" He told them to shut up, and he insulted them.
He said, "In 16 hours we will reach the shores of Italy.
" They were weak and weary.
Soon they saw a boat approach -- a smaller boat, 10 men on board, who started shouting at them, hurling insults, throwing sticks, asking them to all disembark and get on this smaller, more unseaworthy boat.
The parents were terrified for their children, and they collectively refused to disembark.
So the boat sped away in anger, and a half an hour later, came back and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat, just below where she and Bassem were sitting.
And she heard how they yelled, "Let the fish eat your flesh!
" And they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank.
The 300 people below deck were doomed.
Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank, and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller.
Bassem said to her, "Please let go, or you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you, too.
" And remember -- she can't swim.
But she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs, thinking, "This is swimming.
" And miraculously, Bassem found a life ring.
It was one of those child's rings that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas.
And Doaa climbed onto the ring, her arms and her legs dangling by the side.
Bassem was a good swimmer, so he held her hand and tread water.
Around them there were corpses.
Around 100 people survived initially, and they started coming together in groups, praying for rescue.
But when a day went by and no one came, some people gave up hope, and Doaa and Bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water.
One man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder, nine months old -- Malek.
He was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat, and he said to them, "I fear I am not going to survive.
I'm too weak.
I don't have the courage anymore.
" And he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa, and they perched her onto the life ring.
So now they were three, Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.
And let me take a pause in this story right here and ask the question: why do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks?
Millions of refugees are living in exile, in limbo.
They're living in countries [fleeing] from a war that has been raging for four years.
Even if they wanted to return, they can't.
Their homes, their businesses, their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed.
This is a UNESCO World Heritage City, Homs, in Syria.
So people continue to flee into neighboring countries, and we build refugee camps for them in the desert.
Hundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these, and thousands and thousands more, millions, live in towns and cities.
And the communities, the neighboring countries that once welcomed them with open arms and hearts are overwhelmed.
There are simply not enough schools, water systems, sanitation.
Even rich European countries could never handle such an influx without massive investment.
The Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders, but over seven million people are on the run inside the country.
That means that over half the Syrian population has been forced to flee.
Back to those neighboring countries hosting so many.
They feel that the richer world has done too little to support them.
And days have turned into months, months into years.
A refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary.
Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.
It was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak.
And now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem, "My love, please hold on to hope, to our future.
We will make it.
" And he released himself into the water, and Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes.
So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee who was terrified of the water, who couldn't swim, found herself in charge of two little baby kids.
The sun was blazing during the day.
" But his heart soon stopped, and Doaa had to release the little boy into the water.
Later that day, she looked up into the sky with hope, because she saw two planes crossing in the sky.
And she waved her arms, hoping they would see her, but the planes were soon gone.
But that afternoon, as the sun was going down, she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.
" One of those messages said, "I believe you saved my little niece, Masa.
Well, word went around about her survival, too.
Why did she have to go through all that?
The world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s.
Bassem was also struggling in Egypt, and he said to Doaa, "Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.
I will work, you can study -- the promise of a new life.
They were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat, 500 of them crammed onto that boat, 300 below, [200] above. There were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims and Christians, 100 children, including Sandra -- little Sandra, six years old -- and Masa, 18 months.

Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank, and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller.
Bassem said to her, "Please let go, or you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you, too.

So now they were three, Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.
And let me take a pause in this story right here and ask the question: why do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks?
Millions of refugees are living in exile, in limbo.

Back to those neighboring countries hosting so many.

And days have turned into months, months into years.
A refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary.
Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.
It was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak.
And now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem, "My love, please hold on to hope, to our future.
We will make it.
" And he said to her, "I'm sorry, my love, that I put you in this situation.
I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.
" And he released himself into the water, and Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes.
Later that day, a mother came up to Doaa with her small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.
This was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier, with the life vests.
Her older sister Sandra had just drowned, and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power to save her daughter.
And she said to Doaa, "Please take this child.
Let her be part of you.
I will not survive.
" And then she went away and drowned.
So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee who was terrified of the water, who couldn't swim, found herself in charge of two little baby kids.
And they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated, and she tried her best to amuse them, to sing to them, to say words to them from the Quran.
Around them, the bodies were bloating and turning black.
The sun was blazing during the day.
At night, there was a cold moon and fog.
It was very frightening.
On the fourth day in the water, this is how Doaa probably looked on the ring with her two children.
A woman came on the fourth day and approached her and asked her to take another child -- a little boy, just four years old.
When Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned, she said to the sobbing child, "She just went away to find you water and food.
" But his heart soon stopped, and Doaa had to release the little boy into the water.
Later that day, she looked up into the sky with hope, because she saw two planes crossing in the sky.
And she waved her arms, hoping they would see her, but the planes were soon gone.
But that afternoon, as the sun was going down, she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.
And she said, "Please, God, let them rescue me.
" She waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours.
And it had become dark, but finally the searchlights found her and they extended a rope, astonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies.
They pulled them onto the boat, they got oxygen and blankets, and a Greek helicopter came to pick them up and take them to the island of Crete.
But Doaa looked down and asked, "What of Malek?
" And they told her the little baby did not survive -- she drew her last breath in the boat's clinic.
But Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat, that little baby girl had been smiling.
Only 11 people survived that wreck, of the 500. There was never an international investigation into what happened.
There were some media reports about mass murder at sea, a terrible tragedy, but that was only for one day.
And then the news cycle moved on.
Meanwhile, in a pediatric hospital on Crete, little Masa was on the edge of death.
She was really dehydrated.
Her kidneys were failing.
Her glucose levels were dangerously low.
The doctors did everything in their medical power to save them, and the Greek nurses never left her side, holding her, hugging her, singing her words.
My colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic.
Amazingly, little Masa survived.
And soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby, who had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink, and offers to adopt her came from all over the country.
And meanwhile, Doaa was in another hospital on Crete, thin, dehydrated.
An Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released.
And soon word went around about Doaa's survival, and a phone number was published on Facebook.
Messages started coming in.
"Doaa, do you know what happened to my brother?
My sister?
My parents?
My friends?
Do you know if they survived?
" One of those messages said, "I believe you saved my little niece, Masa.
" And it had this photo.
This was from Masa's uncle, a Syrian refugee who had made it to Sweden with his family and also Masa's older sister.
Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited with him in Sweden, and until then, she's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.
And Doaa?
Well, word went around about her survival, too.
And the media wrote about this slight woman, and couldn't imagine how she could survive all this time under such conditions in that sea, and still save another life.
The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's most prestigious institutions, gave her an award of bravery, and she deserves all that praise, and she deserves a second chance.
But she wants to still go to Sweden.
She wants to reunite with her family there.
She wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings away from Egypt there as well, and I believe she will succeed.
She wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight injustice.
She is an extraordinary survivor.
But I have to ask: what if she didn't have to take that risk?
Why did she have to go through all that?
Why wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe?
Why couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden?
Why couldn't Bassem have found work?
Why is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees, the victims of the worst war of our times?
The world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s.
Why not now?
Why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees?
And why, the root question, is so little being done to stop the wars, the persecution and the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of Europe?
Until these issues are resolved, people will continue to take to the seas and to seek safety and asylum.
And what happens next?
Well, that is largely Europe's choice.
And I understand the public fears.
People are worried about their security, their economies, the changes of culture.
But is that more important than saving human lives?
Because there is something fundamental here that I think overrides the rest, and it is about our common humanity.
No person fleeing war or persecution should have to die crossing a sea to reach safety.
(Applause) One thing is for sure, that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are.
And no migrant would take that dangerous journey if they had enough food for themselves and their children.
And no one would put their life savings in the hands of those notorious smugglers if there was a legal way to migrate.
So on behalf of little Masa and on behalf of Doaa and of Bassem and of those 500 people who drowned with them, can we make sure that they did not die in vain?
Could we be inspired by what happened, and take a stand for a world in which every life matters?
Thank you.
(Applause)
A few years ago, I broke into my own house.
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.
It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate, it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking.
And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making, and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making -- any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
It's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped. And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that?
The number should be one. My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help. But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way. And it's not the doctor's fault, if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me.
We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough. But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people. So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin, what do you suppose it is?
How many people have to take it before one person is helped?
300. This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed by Bloomberg. com. I ran through the numbers myself.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented. Now you're probably thinking, "Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol. Why not, doc?
Give me the prescription anyway. " But you should ask at this point for another statistic, and that is, "Tell me about the side effects. " Right?
We all go to doctors.
And we do so with trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they're prescribing are based upon evidence -- evidence that's designed to help us.
However, the reality is that that hasn't always been the case for everyone.
What if I told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based on only half the population?
I'm an emergency medicine doctor.
I was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency.
It's about saving lives.
How cool is that?
OK, there's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes, but no matter who walks through the door to the ER, we order the same tests, we prescribe the same medication, without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients. Why would we?
We were never taught that there were any differences between men and women.
A recent Government Accountability study revealed that 80 percent of the drugs withdrawn from the market are due to side effects on women. So let's think about that for a minute.
Why are we discovering side effects on women only after a drug has been released to the market?
Do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory, to animal studies, to then clinical trials on humans, finally to go through a regulatory approval process, to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you?
Not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding it takes to go through that process. So why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that has gone through?
What's happening?
Well, it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory, they're male cells, and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals, and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men.
How is it that the male model became our framework for medical research?
Let's look at an example that has been popularized in the media, and it has to do with the sleep aid Ambien.
Ambien was released on the market over 20 years ago, and since then, hundreds of millions of prescriptions have been written, primarily to women, because women suffer more sleep disorders than men.
What did this do to the notion of women's health?
Women's health became synonymous with reproduction: breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.
But they have their own anatomy and physiology that deserves to be studied with the same intensity.
Let's take the cardiovascular system, for example.
Heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women, but more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men.
Men will complain of crushing chest pain -- an elephant is sitting on their chest.
The Institute of Medicine has said every cell has a sex.
What does this mean?
Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?
And if we give antidepressants, then we increase the production of these newborn neurons, and we decrease the symptoms of depression, establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression.
So what about learning?
Yes, stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus.
We don't want to fall in a situation -- (Laughter) about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation.
Ethanol -- intake of alcohol -- will decrease neurogenesis.
And on your side -- I leave you in charge of your neurogenesis. Thank you. (Applause) Margaret Heffernan: Fantastic research, Sandrine.
Imagine being unable to say, "I am hungry," "I am in pain," "thank you," or "I love you. " Being trapped inside your body, a body that doesn't respond to commands.
Surrounded by people, yet utterly alone.
Wishing you could reach out, to connect, to comfort, to participate. For 13 long years, that was my reality.
Most of us never think twice about talking, about communicating. I've thought a lot about it. I've had a lot of time to think. For the first 12 years of my life, I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.
For me, the worst was the feeling of utter powerlessness.
I simply existed. It's a very dark place to find yourself because in a sense, you have vanished. Other people controlled every aspect of my life. They decided what I ate and when.
Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.
With no way to communicate, I became the perfect victim: a defenseless object, seemingly devoid of feelings that people used to play out their darkest desires. For more than 10 years, people who were charged with my care abused me physically, verbally and sexually.
Despite what they thought, I did feel. The first time it happened, I was shocked and filled with disbelief.
How could they do this to me?
I was confused.
What had I done to deserve this?
Part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight.
Hurt, sadness and anger flooded through me.
I felt worthless.
There was no one to comfort me. But neither of my parents knew this was happening. I lived in terror, knowing it would happen again and again. I just never knew when.
Still, things were going well. My body was slowly getting stronger. I had a job in computing that I loved, and had even got Kojak, the dog I had been dreaming about for years. However, I longed to share my life with someone.
The first time someone referred to me as a man, it stopped me in my tracks.
I felt like looking around and asking, "Who, me?
" That all changed with Joan.
We have an amazing connection and I learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly.
I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence to truly say what I thought.
I started to feel whole again, a man worthy of love. I began to reshape my destiny.
I spoke up a little more at work.
I asserted my need for independence to the people around me. Being given a means of communication changed everything.
All this is how the world knows who we are. So who are we without it?
True communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world.
Once, I was perceived to be an inanimate object, a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair. Today, I am so much more.
A husband, a son, a friend, a brother, a business owner, a first-class honors graduate, a keen amateur photographer.
It is my ability to communicate that has given me all this.
We are told that actions speak louder than words.
But I wonder, do they?
Our words, however we communicate them, are just as powerful.
Whether we speak the words with our own voices, type them with our eyes, or communicate them non-verbally to someone who speaks them for us, words are among our most powerful tools.
I have come to you through a terrible darkness, pulled from it by caring souls and by language itself. The act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light.
We are shining here together.
If there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating, it is that sometimes I want to shout and other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude. It all sounds the same.
But if you will, please imagine these next two words as warmly as you can: Thank you. (Applause)Imagine being unable to say, "I am hungry," "I am in pain," "thank you," or "I love you. " Being trapped inside your body, a body that doesn't respond to commands.

How could they do this to me?
I was confused.
What had I done to deserve this?
Part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight.
Hurt, sadness and anger flooded through me.
I felt worthless.
There was no one to comfort me. But neither of my parents knew this was happening. I lived in terror, knowing it would happen again and again. I just never knew when.
Still, things were going well. My body was slowly getting stronger. I had a job in computing that I loved, and had even got Kojak, the dog I had been dreaming about for years. However, I longed to share my life with someone.
The first time someone referred to me as a man, it stopped me in my tracks.
I felt like looking around and asking, "Who, me?
" That all changed with Joan.
We have an amazing connection and I learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly.
I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence to truly say what I thought.
I started to feel whole again, a man worthy of love. I began to reshape my destiny.
I spoke up a little more at work.
I asserted my need for independence to the people around me. Being given a means of communication changed everything.
All this is how the world knows who we are. So who are we without it?
True communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world.
Once, I was perceived to be an inanimate object, a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair. Today, I am so much more.
A husband, a son, a friend, a brother, a business owner, a first-class honors graduate, a keen amateur photographer.
It is my ability to communicate that has given me all this.
We are told that actions speak louder than words.
But I wonder, do they?
Our words, however we communicate them, are just as powerful.
Whether we speak the words with our own voices, type them with our eyes, or communicate them non-verbally to someone who speaks them for us, words are among our most powerful tools.
I have come to you through a terrible darkness, pulled from it by caring souls and by language itself. The act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light.
We are shining here together.
If there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating, it is that sometimes I want to shout and other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude. It all sounds the same.
But if you will, please imagine these next two words as warmly as you can: Thank you. (Applause)
" "But Nike is multinational," I thought, "I'm a human being. " Then, one fine day, mid-tour, I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark where I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann. We were discussing the role of locality in writing, when suddenly it hit me.
I'm not multinational. I'm not a national at all. How could I come from a nation?
How can a human being come from a concept?
It's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades.
In my lifetime, countries had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia; appeared -- Timor-Leste; failed -- Somalia.
My parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born. To me, a country -- this thing that could be born, die, expand, contract -- hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being.
And so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state.
What we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood, an idea that came into fashion only 400 years ago. When I learned this, beginning my masters degree in international relations, I felt a sort of surge of relief.

In the year 1901, a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.
Auguste was delusional and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life.
Her doctor was called Alois.
Alois didn't know how to help Auguste, but he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906. After she died, Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain -- the likes of which he'd never seen before.
Now here's the even more striking thing.
If Auguste had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago. Alois was Dr.
Alois Alzheimer. And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease. Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly. We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, many treatments for cancer, antiretrovirals for HIV, statins for heart disease and much more.
But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide.
One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.
It is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050, as the baby boomer generation ages. It may surprise you that, put simply, Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But we've done relatively little to address it.
The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause: a lack of awareness.
Because here's what few people know but everyone should: Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.

For the last year, everyone's been watching the same show, and I'm not talking about "Game of Thrones," but a horrifying, real-life drama that's proved too fascinating to turn off.
It's a show produced by murderers and shared around the world via the Internet.
The headlines called them savages and barbarians, because the image of one man overpowering another, killing him with a knife to the throat, conforms to our idea of ancient, primitive practices, the polar opposite of our urban, civilized ways.
We don't do things like that.
But that's the irony.
We think a beheading has nothing to do with us, even as we click on the screen to watch.
But it is to do with us.
The Islamic State beheadings are not ancient or remote.
They're a global, 21st century event, a 21st century event that takes place in our living rooms, at our desks, on our computer screens.
They're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us.
And whether we like it or not, everyone who watches is a part of the show.
And lots of people watch.
We don't know exactly how many.
Obviously, it's difficult to calculate.
But a poll taken in the UK, for example, in August 2014, estimated that 1.2 million people had watched the beheading of James Foley in the few days after it was released.
And that's just the first few days, and just Britain.
A similar poll taken in the United States in November 2014 found that nine percent of those surveyed had watched beheading videos, and a further 23 percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown.
Nine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch, but it's still a very large crowd.
And of course that crowd is growing all the time, because every week, every month, more people will keep downloading and keep watching.
If we go back 11 years, before sites like YouTube and Facebook were born, it was a similar story.
When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl, Nick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded, those videos were shown during the Iraq War.
Nick Berg's beheading quickly became one of the most searched for items on the Internet.
Within a day, it was the top search term across search engines like Google, Lycos, Yahoo.
" The al-Qaeda-linked website that first showed Nick Berg's beheading had to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site.
One Dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures rose from 300,000 to 750,000 every time a beheading in Iraq was shown.
He told reporters 18 months later that it had been downloaded many millions of times, and that's just one website.
A similar pattern was seen again and again when videos of beheadings were released during the Iraq War.
Social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before, but if we take another step back in history, we'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd in our history of beheadings as public spectacle.
As soon as the camera appeared on the scene, a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939, it had an immediate and unequivocal effect.
That day, the first film of a public beheading was created in France.
It was the execution, the guillotining, of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann, outside the prison Saint-Pierre in Versailles.
Weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn, as was customary at the time, but his executioner was new to the job, and he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare.
So Weidmann was executed at 4:30 in the morning, by which time on a June morning, there was enough light to take photographs, and a spectator in the crowd filmed the event, unbeknownst to the authorities.
Several still photographs were taken as well, and you can still watch the film online today and look at the photographs.
The crowd on the day of Weidmann's execution was called "unruly" and "disgusting" by the press, but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again, freeze-framed in every detail.
The camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before, but it's not just about the camera.
If we take a bigger leap back in history, we'll see that for as long as there have been public judicial executions and beheadings, there have been the crowds to see them.
In London, as late as the early 19th century, there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging.
And a beheading, which was a rare event in England at the time, attracted even more.
In May 1820, five men known as the Cato Street Conspirators were executed in London for plotting to assassinate members of the British government.
They were hung and then decapitated.
It was a gruesome scene.
Each man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd.
The streets were packed.
People had rented out windows and rooftops.
People climbed lamp posts.
All too often, execution day was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony.
Today, a public judicial execution in Europe or America is unthinkable, but there are other scenarios that should make us cautious about thinking that things are different now and we don't behave like that anymore.
Take, for example, the incidents of suicide baiting.
This is when a crowd gathers to watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building in order to kill themselves, and people in the crowd shout and jeer, "Get on with it! Go on and jump!
" This is a well-recognized phenomenon.
One paper in 1981 found that in 10 out of 21 threatened suicide attempts, there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd.
And there have been incidents reported in the press this year.
And when it happens today, people take photographs and they take videos on their phones and they post those videos online.
It's nothing to do with me.
It's already happened.
Today, a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching.
Or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life or you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time.
On the contrary, we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen.
When the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless, he or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show.
Unlike a trophy head that's taken in battle, that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight, when a beheading is staged, when it's essentially a piece of theater, the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs.
Now the event is stretched out in time and place, and everyone who watches plays their part.
We should stop watching, but we know we won't.
History tells us we won't, and the killers know it too.
Thank you.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Let me get this back.
Thank you.
Let's move here. While they install for the next performance, I want to ask you the question that probably many here have, which is how did you get interested in this topic?
Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which was famous for its display of shrunken heads from South America.
People used to say, "Oh, the shrunken head museum, the shrunken head museum!
" And at the time, I was working on the history of scientific collections of skulls.
So I wanted to kind of twist it round and say, "Let's look at us.
" We're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads.
Let's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things.
BG: Thank you for sharing that.
FL: Thank you.

In London, as late as the early 19th century, there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging.
There could be 40,000 or 50,000 to see a famous criminal killed.
And a beheading, which was a rare event in England at the time, attracted even more.
In May 1820, five men known as the Cato Street Conspirators were executed in London for plotting to assassinate members of the British government.
They were hung and then decapitated.
It was a gruesome scene.
Each man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd.
The streets were packed.
People had rented out windows and rooftops.
People had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street.
People climbed lamp posts.
People had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days.
Evidence suggests that throughout our history of public beheadings and public executions, the vast majority of the people who come to see are either enthusiastic or, at best, unmoved.
Disgust has been comparatively rare, and even when people are disgusted and are horrified, it doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch.
Perhaps the most striking example of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved and even be disappointed was the introduction in France in 1792 of the guillotine, that famous decapitation machine.
To us in the 21st century, the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption, but to the first crowds who saw it, it was actually a disappointment.
They were used to seeing long, drawn-out, torturous executions on the scaffold, where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly.
All too often, execution day was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony.
Take, for example, the incidents of suicide baiting.
" This is a well-recognized phenomenon.
One paper in 1981 found that in 10 out of 21 threatened suicide attempts, there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd.
And there have been incidents reported in the press this year.
This was a very widely reported incident in Telford and Shropshire in March this year.
And when it happens today, people take photographs and they take videos on their phones and they post those videos online.
It's nothing to do with me.
It's already happened.
We are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy.
Today, we are all offered front row seats.
We can all watch in private, in our own time and space, and no one need ever know that we've clicked on the screen to watch.
This sense of separation -- from other people, from the event itself -- seems to be key to understanding our ability to watch, and there are several ways in which the Internet creates a sense of detachment that seems to erode individual moral responsibility.
Our activities online are often contrasted with real life, as though the things we do online are somehow less real.
We feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online.
There's a sense of anonymity, a sense of invisibility, so we feel less accountable for our behavior.
The Internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently, things that we would usually avoid in everyday life.
Today, a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching.
Or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life or you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time.
And when the action is pre-recorded and takes place in a distant time and space, watching seems like a passive activity.
There's nothing I can do about it now.
It's already happened.
All these things make it easier as an Internet user for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death, to push our personal boundaries, to test our sense of shock, to explore our sense of shock.
But we're not passive when we watch.
On the contrary, we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen.
When the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless, he or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show.
Unlike a trophy head that's taken in battle, that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight, when a beheading is staged, when it's essentially a piece of theater, the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs.
The event no longer takes place in a single location at a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to.
Now the event is stretched out in time and place, and everyone who watches plays their part.
We should stop watching, but we know we won't.
History tells us we won't, and the killers know it too.

I published this article in the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year.
"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This. " And the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is fairly simple: two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other's eyes without speaking for four minutes.
So here are a couple of sample questions.
Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
Number 28: When did you last cry in front of another person?
By yourself?
As you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.
Number 30, I really like this one: Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things you might not say to someone you just met.
So when I first came across this study a few years earlier, one detail really stuck out to me, and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later, and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony.
So I was of course very skeptical about this process of just manufacturing romantic love, but of course I was intrigued.
And when I got the chance to try this study myself, with someone I knew but not particularly well, I wasn't expecting to fall in love.
But then we did, and -- (Laughter) And I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later.
Now, this was published in January, and now it is August, so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering, are we still together?
And the reason I think you might be wondering this is because I have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months.
And this question is really what I want to talk about today.
But let's come back to it.
(Laughter) So the week before the article came out, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years, so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog.
But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most, and those were usually just my Facebook friends, and I figured my article in the New York Times would probably get a few thousand views.
And that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship.
But as it turned out, I had no idea.
So the article was published online on a Friday evening, and by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog.
And by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called.
Within a month, the article would receive over 8 million views, and I was, to say the least, underprepared for this sort of attention.
(Laughter) And when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks, they always asked the same question first: are you guys still together?
In fact, as I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search of my email inbox for the phrase "Are you still together?
" and several messages popped up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and friendly strangers like this one.
I did radio interviews and they asked.
I even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage, "Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?
" And I promptly turned bright red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response.
The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own. In fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article for Valentine's Day, which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves, with varying degrees of success.
So my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship.
I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together.
I turned down TV interviews, and I said no to every request for photos of the two us.
I think I was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love, a position I did not at all feel qualified for.
And I get it: people didn't just want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked: that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last, not just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering.
My own relationship was only a few months old, and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place.
What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them?
If the answer was no, would it make the experience of doing these 36 questions any less worthwhile? Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in 1997, and here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students, by using what Aron called "sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure.
" Sounds romantic, doesn't it?
But the study did work.
The original version of the story, the one that I tried last summer, that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was referenced in this article, but unfortunately it was never published.
So a few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college, and a student came up to me afterwards and he said, kind of shyly, "So, I tried your study, and it didn't work.
" He seemed a little mystified by this.
"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?
" I asked. "Well. . . " He paused.
"I think she just wants to be friends.
" "But did you become better friends?
" I asked.
"Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?
" He nodded.
"So, then it worked," I said.
I don't think this is the answer he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love.
I first came across this study when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult breakup.
I had been in the relationship since I was 20, which was basically my entire adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him.
So I turned to science.
I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache.
I don't know if I realized this at the time -- I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing -- but it seems really obvious in retrospect.
I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love, I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways.
I am more patient with love.
I am more relaxed.
I am more confident about asking for what I want.
But I can also see myself more clearly, and I can see that what I want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for.
What I want from love is a guarantee, not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow, but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely.
Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together.
So the story that the media told about the 36 questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love.
There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved, and this is a very appealing story, because falling in love feels amazing, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that asks, "Are you still together?
" and is content with a yes or no answer.
So rather than that question, I would propose we ask some more difficult questions, questions like: How do you decide who deserves your love and who does not?
How do you stay in love when things get difficult, and how do you know when to just cut and run?
How do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship, or even harder, how do you live with your partner's doubt?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want it, the short version of the story of my relationship is this: a year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study designed to create romantic love, and we fell in love, and we are still together, and I am so glad.
But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love.
Falling in love is the easy part.
So at the end of my article, I wrote, "Love didn't happen to us.
We're in love because we each made the choice to be.
" And I cringe a little when I read that now, not because it isn't true, but because at the time, I really hadn't considered everything that was contained in that choice.
I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice, and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me.
And what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting, is for that myth to be true.
I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article, which is, incidentally, the only part of the article that I didn't actually write.
"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This. " And the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is fairly simple: two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other's eyes without speaking for four minutes.
So here are a couple of sample questions.
Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
Number 28: When did you last cry in front of another person?
By yourself?
As you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.
Number 30, I really like this one: Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things you might not say to someone you just met.
And when I got the chance to try this study myself, with someone I knew but not particularly well, I wasn't expecting to fall in love.
But then we did, and -- (Laughter) And I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later.
Now, this was published in January, and now it is August, so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering, are we still together?
And this question is really what I want to talk about today.
But let's come back to it.
I had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years, so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog.
And that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship.
Within a month, the article would receive over 8 million views, and I was, to say the least, underprepared for this sort of attention.
(Laughter) And when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks, they always asked the same question first: are you guys still together?
They were from students and journalists and friendly strangers like this one.
I did radio interviews and they asked.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together.
And I get it: people didn't just want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked: that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last, not just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.
" Sounds romantic, doesn't it?
" He seemed a little mystified by this.
"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?
" I asked. "Well. . . " He paused.
"I think she just wants to be friends.
I don't know if I realized this at the time -- I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing -- but it seems really obvious in retrospect.
I am more confident about asking for what I want.
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone.
I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice, and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me.
(Laughter) You may be asking yourselves that very question. Now, I know of course, we have to make a living, but nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question, "Why do we work?
Why is it that as capitalism developed, it created a mode of production, of goods and services, in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated?
Where are the two fastest?On the US team. And the two other runners on the US team are not bad, either. (Laughter) So clearly, the US team has won the war for talent. But behind, the average team is trying to catch up.
Because of cooperation. When you hear this sentence: "Thanks to cooperation, the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts. " This is not poetry; this is not philosophy. This is math.
Am I supposed to run for 95 meters, 96, 97.. . ?
" It's important, let's be clear. If you say 97, after 97 meters, people will drop the baton, whether there is someone to take it or not. Accountability. We are constantly trying to put accountability in someone's hands. Who is accountable for this process?
So you have to recognize the voice of your colleague.You cannot say, "Is it you?" Too late!
In the legs of the next runner. But when the next runner runs super-fast, is it because she made a super effort, or because of the way the third runner passed the baton?
Fuzziness overlaps.Remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance. Speed the "what. " Look at cooperation, the "how. " How did you pass the baton?
Did you throw it, or did you pass it effectively?
Am I putting my energy in what can get measured -- my legs, my speed -- or in passing the baton?
You, as leaders, as managers, are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate?

For more than 100 years, the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments. For much of this time, this assistance was manual. Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand. Calls were recorded to tape.
But as in so many other industries, computing has changed everything. The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks.
You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys. And so for that reason, I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible.

This is a painting from the 16th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder.
It shows the famous Fountain of Youth.
If you drink its water or you bathe in it, you will get health and youth.
Every culture, every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth.
There are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De León, the explorer, who spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth. They didn't find it. But what if there was something to it?
What if there was something to this Fountain of Youth?
I will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age-related diseases in the future.
And up to around age 50 or 60, these functions are all intact, and as I look at the young audience here in the room, we're all still fine.
(Laughter) But it's scary to see how all these curves go south.
And as we get older, diseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop.
We know that with age, the connections between neurons -- the way neurons talk to each other, the synapses -- they start to deteriorate; neurons die, the brain starts to shrink, and there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases.
One big problem we have -- to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level -- is that we can't study the brains in detail, in living people.
We can do cognitive tests, we can do imaging -- all kinds of sophisticated testing.
So if the body ages or gets sick, does that affect the brain?
And vice versa: as the brain gets older, does that influence the rest of the body?
So if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age, can we learn something about the brain?
And to illustrate what we can do potentially with that, I want to talk you through an experiment that we did.
And the way this looks is shown in this graph.So, on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived, the chronological age.So, how many years they lived. And then we take these top factors that I showed you, and we calculate their relative age, their biological age.
And what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation, so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person. But what's really exciting are the outliers, as they so often are in life.
You can see here, the person I highlighted with the green dot is about 70 years of age but seems to have a biological age, if what we're doing here is really true, of only about 45. So is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age?
But more importantly: Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age-related disease and will have a long life -- will live to 100 or more?
On the other hand, the person here, highlighted with the red dot, is not even 40, but has a biological age of 65. Is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease?
So in our lab, we're trying to understand these factors better, and many other groups are trying to understand, what are the true aging factors, and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age-related diseases?
So what I've shown you so far is simply correlational, right?
You can just say, "Well, these factors change with age," but you don't really know if they do something about aging.
So what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue.
And that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis.
So, parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together, and that leads then to a shared blood system, where we can now ask, "How does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood?
" And for this purpose, we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people, and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years.
What we found is quite remarkable. We find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains. There's an increased activity of the synapses, the connections between neurons. There are more genes expressed that are known to be involved in the formation of new memories.
And there's less of this bad inflammation. But we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals.
What I'm showing you now are unpublished studies, where we used human plasma, young human plasma, and as a control, saline, and injected it into old mice, and asked, can we again rejuvenate these old mice?Can we make them smarter?
Some muscles will become tight and inflexbile.
Others will be inhibited.
Researchers have linked poor posture to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain, though it isn't the exclusive cause of any of them.
You aren't born with this s-shaped spine.
If they are aligned properly, when you're standing up, you should be able to draw a straight line from a point just in front of your shoulders, to behind your hip, to the front of your knee, to a few inches in front of your ankle.
If you're sitting, your neck should be vertical, not tilted forward.
Adjust your screen so it's at or slightly below eyelevel.
Try sleeping on your side with your neck supported and with a pillow between your legs.
It's also not enough to just have good posture.
Keeping your muscles and joints moving is extremely important.
When you do move, move smartly.
Keeping your muscles and joints moving is extremely important.
In fact, being stationary for long periods with good posture can be worse than regular movement with bad posture.
When you do move, move smartly.
Keep anything you're carrying close to your body.
Backpacks should be in contact with your back carried symetrically.
If you sit a lot, get up and move around on occassion, and be sure to exercise.
Using your muscles will keep them strong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits to your joints, bones, brain and heart.
And if you're really worried, check with a physical therapist, because yes, you really should stand up straight.
Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors were insignificant animals. The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant. Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers. Today, in contrast, we control this planet.
And the question is: How did we come from there to here?How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes, minding their own business in a corner of Africa, into the rulers of planet Earth?
I need to know you personally. What kind of chimpanzee are you? Are you a nice chimpanzee? Are you an evil chimpanzee?
Are you trustworthy?
The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is: How, exactly, do we do it?What enables us alone, of all the animals, to cooperate in such a way?
A chimpanzee may say, "Look!There's a lion, let's run away!
" Or, "Look!
There's a banana tree over there!
Take, for example, the legal field.Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights.But what are human rights?Human rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented.
What exactly are these things?They are what lawyers call legal fictions. They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers. (Laughter) And what do corporations do all day?
Mostly, they try to make money. Yet, what is money?
Again, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value. Take this green piece of paper, the dollar bill. Look at it -- it has no value. You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it, you cannot wear it.
You could never do it with chimpanzees.Chimpanzees trade, of course: "Yes, you give me a coconut, I'll give you a banana." That can work.But, you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana?No way! What do you think I am, a human?

Look for instance at "Minute Physics," a guy who's teaching the world about physics: (Video) Let's cut to the chase.
As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally.
But, you might ask, why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model, alongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks, if it hadn't been discovered back then in the 1970s?
Good question.
There are two main reasons.
Here's a video about abstract mathematics.(Video) So you're me, and you're in math class yet again, because they make you go every single day. And you're learning about, I don't know, the sums of infinite series. That's a high school topic, right?

Well, you don't know because you couldn't understand it. It wasn't clear. But hopefully, it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious. Clarity or mystery?
All right.["Unuseful mystery"] What happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up?And we see this all the time. This is what I call unuseful mystery. I go down into the subway -- I take the subway a lot -- and this piece of paper is taped to a girder. Right?

I love a great mystery, and I'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science, perhaps because it's personal.
It's about who we are, and I can't help but be curious.
The mystery is this: What is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences, such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet? Now, this mystery is not new.
In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote, "How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.
" Now, Huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated, but he didn't know why.
To the science of his day, it was a mystery.
In the years since Huxley, science has learned a lot about brain activity, but the relationship between brain activity and conscious experiences is still a mystery.
Why? Why have we made so little progress?
Well, some experts think that we can't solve this problem because we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence.
We don't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics, and as it happens, we can't expect our species to solve this problem either.
Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.
I think we've simply made a false assumption.
Once we fix it, we just might solve this problem.
Today, I'd like tell you what that assumption is, why it's false, and how to fix it.
Let's begin with a question: Do we see reality as it is?
I open my eyes and I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away.
As a result, I come to believe that in reality, there's a red tomato a meter away.
I then close my eyes, and my experience changes to a gray field, but is it still the case that in reality, there's a red tomato a meter away?
Could I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions?
We have misinterpreted our perceptions before.
We used to think the Earth is flat, because it looks that way.
Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe, again because it looks that way.
Copernicus and Galileo discovered, again, that we were wrong.
Galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences in other ways.
He wrote: "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on reside in consciousness.
Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be annihilated.
" Now, that's a stunning claim.
Could Galileo be right?
Could we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly? What does modern science have to say about this?
Well, neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain's cortex is engaged in vision.
When you simply open your eyes and look about this room, billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged.
It just takes a picture of objective reality as it is.
Now, there is a part of vision that's like a camera: the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are 130 million photoreceptors, so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.
But that doesn't explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision.
What are these neurons up to?
Well, neuroscientists tell us that they are creating, in real time, all the shapes, objects, colors, and motions that we see.
It feels like we're just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is, but in fact, we're constructing everything that we see.
We don't construct the whole world at once.
In this example, you see some red discs with bits cut out of them, but if I just rotate the disks a little bit, suddenly, you see a 3D cube pop out of the screen.
Now, the screen of course is flat, so the three-dimensional cube that you're experiencing must be your construction.
In this next example, you see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots.
In fact, no dots move.
All I'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue.
But when I do this quickly, your visual system creates the glowing blue bars with the sharp edges and the motion.
There are many more examples, but these are just two that you construct what you see.
But neuroscientists go further.
They say that we reconstruct reality.
So, when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato, that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tomato that would exist even if I weren't looking.
Now, why would neuroscientists say that we don't just construct, we reconstruct?
Well, the standard argument given is usually an evolutionary one.
Those of our ancestors who saw more accurately had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately, and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes.
We are the offspring of those who saw more accurately, and so we can be confident that, in the normal case, our perceptions are accurate.
You see this in the standard textbooks.
One textbook says, for example, "Evolutionarily speaking, vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate.
" So the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions.
They give you a survival advantage.
Now, is this correct?
Is this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory?
Well, let's first look at a couple of examples in nature.
The Australian jewel beetle is dimpled, glossy and brown.
The female is flightless.
The male flies, looking, of course, for a hot female. When he finds one, he alights and mates.
There's another species in the outback, Homo sapiens. The male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer.
(Laughter) And when he finds one, he drains it, and sometimes throws the bottle into the outback. Now, as it happens, these bottles are dimpled, glossy, and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles.
The males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate.
They lose all interest in the real females.
Classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle.
(Laughter) (Applause) The species almost went extinct. Australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles. (Laughter) Now, the males had successfully found females for thousands, perhaps millions of years.
It looked like they saw reality as it is, but apparently not.
Evolution had given them a hack.
A female is anything dimpled, glossy and brown, the bigger the better.
(Laughter) Even when crawling all over the bottle, the male couldn't discover his mistake.
Now, you might say, beetles, sure, they're very simple creatures, but surely not mammals.
Mammals don't rely on tricks.
Well, I won't dwell on this, but you get the idea.
(Laughter) So this raises an important technical question: Does natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is?
Fortunately, we don't have to wave our hands and guess; evolution is a mathematically precise theory.
We can use the equations of evolution to check this out.
We can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete and see which survive and which thrive, which sensory systems are more fit.
A key notion in those equations is fitness.
Consider this steak: What does this steak do for the fitness of an animal?
Well, for a hungry lion looking to eat, it enhances fitness. For a well-fed lion looking to mate, it doesn't enhance fitness.
So, in my lab, we have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations with lots of different randomly chosen worlds and organisms that compete for resources in those worlds.
Some of the organisms see all of the reality, others see just part of the reality, and some see none of the reality, only fitness.
Who wins?
Well, I hate to break it to you, but perception of reality goes extinct.
In almost every simulation, organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness drive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is.
So the bottom line is, evolution does not favor veridical, or accurate perceptions. Those perceptions of reality go extinct.
Now, this is a bit stunning.
How can it be that not seeing the world accurately gives us a survival advantage?
That is a bit counterintuitive.
But remember the jewel beetle.
The jewel beetle survived for thousands, perhaps millions of years, using simple tricks and hacks.
What the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms, including us, are in the same boat as the jewel beetle.
We do not see reality as it is. We're shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive.
Still, we need some help with our intuitions.
How can not perceiving reality as it is be useful?
Well, fortunately, we have a very helpful metaphor: the desktop interface on your computer.
Consider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you're writing.
Does that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue, rectangular, and in the lower right-hand corner of the computer?
Of course not.
Anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface.
It's not there to show you the reality of the computer.
You don't want to know about the diodes and resistors and all the megabytes of software.
If you had to deal with that, you could never write your text file or edit your photo.
So the idea is that evolution has given us an interface that hides reality and guides adaptive behavior. Space and time, as you perceive them right now, are your desktop.
Physical objects are simply icons in that desktop.
There's an obvious objection.
Hoffman, if you think that train coming down the track at 200 MPH is just an icon of your desktop, why don't you step in front of it?
Well, I wouldn't step in front of that train for the same reason that I wouldn't carelessly drag that icon to the trash can: not because I take the icon literally -- the file is not literally blue or rectangular -- but I do take it seriously.
I could lose weeks of work.
They're designed to keep us safe, and we should take them seriously.
That does not mean that we should take them literally.
Another objection: There's nothing really new here.
Well, not exactly.
Those microscopic particles are still in space and time: they're still in the user interface.
So I'm saying something far more radical than those physicists.
Finally, you might object, look, we all see the train, therefore none of us constructs the train.
But remember this example.
We all see a cube because we all, each one of us, constructs the cube that we see.
We all see a train because we each see the train that we construct, and the same is true of all physical objects.
The theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation of our perceptions.
Instead, reality is more like a 3D desktop that's designed to hide the complexity of the real world and guide adaptive behavior.
Physical objects are just the icons in that desktop.
We used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way.
Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way.
We were wrong.
The theory of evolution is telling us that once again, we're wrong.
We're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences.
There's something that exists when you don't look, but it's not spacetime and physical objects.
It's as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle.
Why?
Because we're blind to our own blindnesses.
But we have an advantage over the jewel beetle: our science and technology.
By peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality, and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality.
When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato, I am interacting with reality, but that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato.
Similarly, when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak, I'm interacting with reality, but that reality is not a lion or a steak.
And here's the kicker: When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain, or neurons, I am interacting with reality, but that reality is not a brain or neurons and is nothing like a brain or neurons.
And that reality, whatever it is, is the real source of cause and effect in the world -- not brains, not neurons.
Brains and neurons have no causal powers.
They cause none of our perceptual experiences, and none of our behavior.
Brains and neurons are a species-specific set of symbols, a hack.
What does this mean for the mystery of consciousness?
Well, it opens up new possibilities.
For instance, perhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences.
I doubt this, but it's worth exploring.
Perhaps reality is some vast, interacting network of conscious agents, simple and complex, that cause each other's conscious experiences.
Actually, this isn't as crazy an idea as it seems, and I'm currently exploring it.
I bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating and unexpected than we've ever imagined.
The theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare: Dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth, it's about having kids.
And by the way, even this TED is just in your head. Thank you very much. (Applause) Chris Anderson: If that's really you there, thank you.
So there's so much from this.
Donald Hoffman: Well, this does not stop us from a successful science.
What we have is one theory that turned out to be false, that perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions.
That doesn't stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories about the nature of reality, so it's actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false.
So science continues as normal.
There's no problem here.
CA: So you think it's possible -- (Laughter) -- This is cool, but what you're saying I think is it's possible that evolution can still get you to reason.
DH: Yes. Now that's a very, very good point.
The evolutionary game simulations that I showed were specifically about perception, and they do show that our perceptions have been shaped not to show us reality as it is, but that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics.
We haven't done these simulations, but my bet is that we'll find that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics to be at least in the direction of truth.
I mean, if you're like me, math and logic is not easy.
We don't get it all right, but at least the selection pressures are not uniformly away from true math and logic.
So I think that we'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it. What's true about perception may not be true about math and logic.
CA: I mean, really what you're proposing is a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley interpretation of the world: consciousness causes matter, not the other way around.
DH: Well, it's slightly different than Berkeley.
Berkeley thought that, he was a deist, and he thought that the ultimate nature of reality is God and so forth, and I don't need to go where Berkeley's going, so it's quite a bit different from Berkeley.
I call this conscious realism.
It's actually a very different approach.
CA: Don, I could literally talk with you for hours, and I hope to do that.
Thanks so much for that.
DH: Thank you. (Applause)I love a great mystery, and I'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science, perhaps because it's personal.
It's about who we are, and I can't help but be curious.
The mystery is this: What is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences, such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet? Now, this mystery is not new.
In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote, "How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.
" Now, Huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated, but he didn't know why.
In the years since Huxley, science has learned a lot about brain activity, but the relationship between brain activity and conscious experiences is still a mystery.
Why? Why have we made so little progress?
Well, some experts think that we can't solve this problem because we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence.
We don't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics, and as it happens, we can't expect our species to solve this problem either.
Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.
I think we've simply made a false assumption.
Once we fix it, we just might solve this problem.
Today, I'd like tell you what that assumption is, why it's false, and how to fix it.
Let's begin with a question: Do we see reality as it is?
I open my eyes and I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away.
As a result, I come to believe that in reality, there's a red tomato a meter away.
I then close my eyes, and my experience changes to a gray field, but is it still the case that in reality, there's a red tomato a meter away?
I think so, but could I be wrong?
Could I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions?
We have misinterpreted our perceptions before.
We used to think the Earth is flat, because it looks that way.
Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong.
Copernicus and Galileo discovered, again, that we were wrong.
Galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences in other ways.
He wrote: "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on reside in consciousness.
Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be annihilated.
Could we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly? What does modern science have to say about this?
Now, this is a bit surprising, because to the extent that we think about vision at all, we think of it as like a camera.
It just takes a picture of objective reality as it is.
Now, there is a part of vision that's like a camera: the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are 130 million photoreceptors, so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.
But that doesn't explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision.
What are these neurons up to?
Well, neuroscientists tell us that they are creating, in real time, all the shapes, objects, colors, and motions that we see.
It feels like we're just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is, but in fact, we're constructing everything that we see.
We don't construct the whole world at once.
We construct what we need in the moment.
Now, there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling that we construct what we see.
I'll just show you two.
In this example, you see some red discs with bits cut out of them, but if I just rotate the disks a little bit, suddenly, you see a 3D cube pop out of the screen.
Now, the screen of course is flat, so the three-dimensional cube that you're experiencing must be your construction.

I could lose weeks of work.
Similarly, evolution has shaped us with perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive. We'd better take them seriously.
If you see a snake, don't pick it up.
If you see a cliff, don't jump off.
They're designed to keep us safe, and we should take them seriously.
That does not mean that we should take them literally.
That's a logical error.
Another objection: There's nothing really new here.
Physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around.
There's nothing new here.
Well, not exactly.
It's like saying, I know that that blue icon on the desktop is not the reality of the computer, but if I pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely, I see little pixels, and that's the reality of the computer.
Well, not really -- you're still on the desktop, and that's the point.
Those microscopic particles are still in space and time: they're still in the user interface.
So I'm saying something far more radical than those physicists.

We all see a cube because we all, each one of us, constructs the cube that we see.
The same is true of the train.
We all see a train because we each see the train that we construct, and the same is true of all physical objects.
We're inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is.
The theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation of our perceptions.
Instead, reality is more like a 3D desktop that's designed to hide the complexity of the real world and guide adaptive behavior.
Space as you perceive it is your desktop.
Physical objects are just the icons in that desktop.
We used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way.

I bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating and unexpected than we've ever imagined.
The theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare: Dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth, it's about having kids.

I'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies succeed the most, what factors actually matter the most for startup success.
I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place.
If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup, you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible. You get them to achieve unbelievable things.
But if the startup organization is so great, why do so many fail?
That's what I wanted to find out.
I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success.
And when I graduated from college, I started software companies.
And 20 years ago, I started Idealab, and in the last 20 years, we started more than 100 companies, many successes, and many big failures.
We learned a lot from those failures.
So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure. So I looked at these five. First, the idea.
I never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage, but he once said, "Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face.
" (Laughter) And I think that's so true about business as well.
So much about a team's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer.
The customer is the true reality.
And that's why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing.
Then I started looking at the business model.
Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues?
That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success.
Then I looked at the funding. Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding. Maybe that's the most important thing?
And then of course, the timing.
Is the idea way too early and the world's not ready for it?
Is it early, as in, you're in advance and you have to educate the world?
So first, on these Idealab companies, the top five companies -- Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo, NetZero, Tickets. com -- those all became billion-dollar successes.
And the five companies on the bottom -- Z. com, Insider Pages, MyLife, Desktop Factory, Peoplelink -- we all had high hopes for, but didn't succeed. So I tried to rank across all of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions.
And then for non-Idealab companies, I looked at wild successes, like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn.
And some failures: Webvan, Kozmo, Pets. com Flooz and Friendster.
The bottom companies had intense funding, they even had business models in some cases, but they didn't succeed.
I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies, and the results really surprised me. The number one thing was timing.
Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure.
Team and execution came in second, and the idea, the differentiability of the idea, the uniqueness of the idea, that actually came in third.
Now, this isn't absolutely definitive, it's not to say that the idea isn't important, but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn't the most important thing.
Sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed. The last two, business model and funding, made sense to me actually.
I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating.
And funding, I think as well, if you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction, especially in today's age, it's very, very easy to get intense funding.
" Of course, people proved that wrong.
But one of the reasons it succeeded, aside from a good business model, a good idea, great execution, is the timing.
That company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money, and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger. Same thing with Uber. Uber came out, incredible company, incredible business model, great execution, too.
But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system. Drivers were looking for extra money; it was very, very important.
Some of our early successes, Citysearch, came out when people needed web pages. GoTo. com, which we announced actually at TED in 1998, was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic. We thought the idea was so great, but actually, the timing was probably maybe more important.
And then some of our failures.
We started a company called Z. com, it was an online entertainment company.
We were so excited about it -- we raised enough money, we had a great business model, we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company.
But that was beautifully, beautifully timed.
And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them.
And to be really, really honest about it, not be in denial about any results that you see, because if you have something you love, you want to push it forward, but you have to be very, very honest about that factor on timing.
(Applause)I'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies succeed the most, what factors actually matter the most for startup success.
But if the startup organization is so great, why do so many fail?
That's what I wanted to find out.
I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success.
And when I graduated from college, I started software companies.
We learned a lot from those failures.
So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure. So I looked at these five. First, the idea.
" (Laughter) And I think that's so true about business as well.
So much about a team's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer.
Then I started looking at the business model.
Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues?
That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success.
So first, on these Idealab companies, the top five companies -- Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo, NetZero, Tickets. com -- those all became billion-dollar successes.
And then for non-Idealab companies, I looked at wild successes, like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn.
Team and execution came in second, and the idea, the differentiability of the idea, the uniqueness of the idea, that actually came in third.
I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating.
So what I would say, in summary, is execution definitely matters a lot. The idea matters a lot.
You may not realize this, but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy.
Ultimately, my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research.
Thank you. (Applause)
SK: No.
Well, you have about 80 billion neurons inside your brain right now.
I want you to move your arm as well.
And I am so lucky that not once, as I said before, but thousands of times, I have been able to witness my God in the faces of those children and they are my biggest inspirations. Thank you. (Applause)
When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war.
That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water.
When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.
Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this.
Instead, it looks like this.
If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.
Not missiles, but microbes.
Now, part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents.
But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.
We're not ready for the next epidemic.
Let's look at Ebola.
I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges.
I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication.
And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we didn't have a system at all.
In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.
We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.
The case reports came in on paper.
It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate.
We didn't have a medical team ready to go.
We didn't have a way of preparing people.
Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers.
But even so, we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries.
And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers.
There was no one there to look at treatment approaches.
No one to look at the diagnostics.
No one to figure out what tools should be used.
As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors, processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them.
But that was never tried.
So there was a lot that was missing.
And these things are really a global failure.
The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about.
Now, in the movies it's quite different.
There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood.
The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year. About 10,000 people died, and nearly all were in the three West African countries.
There's three reasons why it didn't spread more.
The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers.
They found the people and they prevented more infections.
The second is the nature of the virus.
Ebola does not spread through the air.
And by the time you're contagious, most people are so sick that they're bedridden.
Third, it didn't get into many urban areas.
And that was just luck.
If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas, the case numbers would have been much larger.
So next time, we might not be so lucky.
You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market.
The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism.
In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air, like the Spanish Flu back in 1918. So here's what would happen: It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.
And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic.
So this is a serious problem.
But in fact, we can build a really good response system.
We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.
So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.
NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained?
I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges.
In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.
We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.

Third, it didn't get into many urban areas.
And that was just luck.
The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism.
So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse.
In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air, like the Spanish Flu back in 1918. So here's what would happen: It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.
And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic.
So this is a serious problem.
We should be concerned.
But in fact, we can build a really good response system.
We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here.
We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them.
We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.
We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen.
So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.
And we need preparedness.
The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared are again, what we do for war.
For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go.
We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers.
NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly.
NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained?
Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies?
So they are absolutely ready to go.
So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic.
What are the key pieces?
First, we need strong health systems in poor countries.
But, also where we'll see the outbreak very early on.
We need a medical reserve corps: lots of people who've got the training and background who are ready to go, with the expertise.
And then we need to pair those medical people with the military.
taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics and secure areas.
We need to do simulations, germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are.
The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well.
So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0. Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.
There are some big breakthroughs, like the Adeno-associated virus, that could work very, very quickly.
Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost, but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm.
The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic, global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths.
These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic.
The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D, those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe.
So I think this should absolutely be a priority.
There's no need to panic.
We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement.
But we need to get going, because time is not on our side.
In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.
If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.
Thank you.
(Applause)
You're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade.
Obviously, that's changed, but only recently.
It was several months ago that I gave my very first major public talk, at the Forbes "30 Under 30 Summit" -- 1,500 brilliant people, all under the age of 30. That meant that in 1998, the oldest among the group were only 14, and the youngest, just four.
I joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs.
Yes, I'm in rap songs.
(Laughter) Almost 40 rap songs.
(Laughter) But the night of my speech, a surprising thing happened.
At the age of 41, I was hit on by a 27-year-old guy.
(Laughter) I know, right?
You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was?
He could make me feel 22 again.
(Laughter) (Applause) I realized, later that night, I'm probably the only person over 40 who does not want to be 22 again.
Can I see a show of hands of anyone here who didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22? Yep.
That's what I thought.
Unlike me, though, your boss probably wasn't the president of the United States of America.
In 1998, after having been swept up into an improbable romance, I was then swept up into the eye of a political, legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before.
Remember, just a few years earlier, news was consumed from just three places: reading a newspaper or magazine, listening to the radio or watching television.
That was it.
But that wasn't my fate.
Instead, this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution.
That meant we could access all the information we wanted, when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere. And when the story broke in January 1998, it broke online.
It was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major news story -- a click that reverberated around the world.
What that meant for me personally was that overnight, I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one, worldwide.
I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously.
This rush to judgment, enabled by technology, led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.
Granted, it was before social media, but people could still comment online, e-mail stories, and, of course, e-mail cruel jokes.
News sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers, banner ads online, and to keep people tuned to the TV.
Do you recall a particular image of me, say, wearing a beret?
(Laughter) But the attention and judgment that I received -- not the story, but that I personally received -- was unprecedented.
I was branded as a tramp, tart, slut, whore, bimbo, and, of course, "that woman.
And I get it: it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional, had a soul and was once unbroken.
When this happened to me 17 years ago, there was no name for it.
In 1998, I lost my reputation and my dignity.
I lost almost everything. And I almost lost my life.
Let me paint a picture for you.
It is September of 1998. I'm sitting in a windowless office room inside the Office of the Independent Counsel, underneath humming fluorescent lights. I'm listening to the sound of my voice, my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before.
I mean, who can remember what they said a year ago?
A few days later, the Starr Report is released to Congress, and all of those tapes and transcripts, those stolen words, form a part of it.
That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough. But a few weeks later, the audiotapes are aired on TV, and significant portions made available online.
The public humiliation was excruciating.
Life was almost unbearable.
This was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998, and by "this," I mean the stealing of people's private words, actions, conversations or photos, and then making them public -- public without consent, public without context and public without compassion.
Fast-forward 12 years, to 2010, and now social media has been born.
The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine, whether or not someone actually made a mistake, and now, it's for both public and private people.
The consequences for some have become dire, very dire.
I was on the phone with my mom in September of 2010, and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from Rutgers University, named Tyler Clementi.
Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler was secretly webcammed by his roommate while being intimate with another man.
He was 18. My mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family, and she was gutted with pain in a way that I just couldn't quite understand.
Today, too many parents haven't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones.
Too many have learned of their child's suffering and humiliation after it was too late.
Tyler's tragic, senseless death was a turning point for me.
It served to recontextualize my experiences, and I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different.
In 1998, we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the internet would take us.
Since then, it has connected people in unimaginable ways -- joining lost siblings, saving lives, launching revolutions . . . But the darkness, cyberbullying, and slut-shaming that I experienced had mushroomed.
A meta-analysis done out of the Netherlands showed that for the first time, cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying.
And you know, what shocked me -- although it shouldn't have -- was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion than either happiness or even anger.
Cruelty to others is nothing new. But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible.
The echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family, village, school or community. But now, it's the online community too.
Millions of people, often anonymously, can stab you with their words, and that's a lot of pain. And there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stockade.
There is a very personal price to public humiliation, and the growth of the internet has jacked up that price.
For nearly two decades now, we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil, both on- and offline.
Gossip websites, paparazzi, reality programming, politics, news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame.
It's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online, which lends itself to trolling, invasion of privacy and cyberbullying.
This shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls "a culture of humiliation.
" Consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone.
Snapchat, the service which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the life span of a few seconds.
You can imagine the range of content that that gets.
A third-party app which Snapchatters use to preserve the life span of the messages was hacked, and 100,000 personal conversations, photos and videos were leaked online, to now have a life span of forever.
Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked, and private, intimate, nude photos were plastered across the internet without their permission.
One gossip website had over five million hits for this one story.
And what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking?
The documents which received the most attention were private e-mails that had maximum public embarrassment value.
This invasion of others is a raw material, efficiently and ruthlessly mined, packaged and sold at a profit. A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity, and shame is an industry.
How is the money made? Clicks. The more shame, the more clicks.
The more clicks, the more advertising dollars.
We're in a dangerous cycle.
The more we click on this kind of gossip, the more numb we get to the human lives behind it. And the more numb we get, the more we click.
All the while, someone is making money off of the back of someone else's suffering.
With every click, we make a choice. The more we saturate our culture with public shaming, the more accepted it is, the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying, trolling, some forms of hacking and online harassment.
Why?
Because they all have humiliation at their cores.
This behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created. Just think about it.
Changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs.
We've seen that to be true with racism, homophobia and plenty of other biases, today and in the past.
As we've changed beliefs about same-sex marriage, more people have been offered equal freedoms.
When we began valuing sustainability, more people began to recycle.
So as far as our culture of humiliation goes, what we need is a cultural revolution.
Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop, and it's time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture.
The shift begins with something simple, but it's not easy.
We need to return to a long-held value of compassion, compassion and empathy.
Online, we've got a compassion deficit, an empathy crisis.
Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote, "Shame can't survive empathy.
" Shame cannot survive empathy.
I've seen some very dark days in my life. It was the compassion and empathy from my family, friends, professionals and sometimes even strangers that saved me.
Even empathy from one person can make a difference.
The theory of minority influence, proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici, says that even in small numbers, when there's consistency over time, change can happen.
In the online world, we can foster minority influence by becoming upstanders.
To become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy, we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation.
Trust me, compassionate comments help abate the negativity.
We can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these kinds of issues, like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the US; in the UK, there's Anti-Bullying Pro; and in Australia, there's PROJECT ROCKIT.
But online, showing empathy to others benefits us all and helps create a safer and better world.We need to communicate online with compassion, consume news with compassion and click with compassion.
Just imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline.
I'd like to end on a personal note. In the past nine months, the question I've been asked the most is "Why?
" Why now?
Why was I sticking my head above the parapet?
You can read between the lines in those questions, and the answer has nothing to do with politics.
The top-note answer was and is "Because it's time.
" Time to stop tiptoeing around my past, time to stop living a life of opprobrium and time to take back my narrative. It's also not just about saving myself.
Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing: You can survive it.
I know it's hard.
It may not be painless, quick or easy, but you can insist on a different ending to your story.
Have compassion for yourself.
We all deserve compassion and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world.
Thank you for listening.
(Applause and cheers)You're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade.

You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was?
He could make me feel 22 again.
(Laughter) (Applause) I realized, later that night, I'm probably the only person over 40 who does not want to be 22 again.
(Laughter) (Applause) At the age of 22, I fell in love with my boss. And at the age of 24, I learned the devastating consequences.
Can I see a show of hands of anyone here who didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22? Yep.
That's what I thought.
So like me, at 22, a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person, maybe even your boss.
Unlike me, though, your boss probably wasn't the president of the United States of America.
(Laughter) Of course, life is full of surprises.
Not a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake, and I regret that mistake deeply.
Remember, just a few years earlier, news was consumed from just three places: reading a newspaper or magazine, listening to the radio or watching television.
That was it.
I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously.
This rush to judgment, enabled by technology, led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.

The consequences for some have become dire, very dire.
Gossip websites, paparazzi, reality programming, politics, news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame.
The more we click on this kind of gossip, the more numb we get to the human lives behind it. And the more numb we get, the more we click.

Data, data, data.So I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product.
However, I was unable to think of anything new at that moment.
(Laughter) My ideas were unoriginal.
I wasn't getting any new ideas and I grew tired of thinking.
It was so hard that I became this skinny.
(Laughter) It's true.
(Applause) You've all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too.
Your boss was being difficult.
The data was difficult.
You become sick of thinking.
Now, I throw out the data.
It's my dream to create new toys.
And now, instead of data, I'm using a game called Shiritori to come up with new ideas.
I would like to introduce this method today.
What is Shiritori?
Take apple, elephant and trumpet, for example.It's a game where you take turns saying words that start with the last letter of the previous word. It's the same in Japanese and English.
You can play Shiritori as you like: "neko, kora, raibu, burashi," etc, etc. [Cat, cola, concert, brush] Many random words will come out.
You force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas. In my case, for example, since I want to think of toys, what could a toy cat be?
A cat that lands after doing a somersault from a high place?
How about a toy with cola?
A toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet?
(Laughter) Ridiculous ideas are okay.
The key is to keep them flowing.
The more ideas you produce, you're sure to come up with some good ones, too.A brush, for example. Can we make a toothbrush into a toy?
We could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and -- (Music noises) -- you've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth.
(Laughter) (Applause) Kids who don't like to brush their teeth might begin to like it.
Can we make a hat into a toy?
How about something like a roulette game, where you try the hat on one by one, and then, when someone puts it on, a scary alien breaks through the top screaming, "Ahh! " I wonder if there would be a demand for this at parties?
(Applause)
As a software developer and technologist, I've worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years.
Civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good, using technology to solve humanitarian problems.
This is in 2010 in Uganda, working on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones for expressing dissent.
That same technology was deployed later in North Africa for similar purposes to help activists stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control.
The tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions that if we build great things, it will positively affect everyone.
Eventually, these innovations will get out and find everyone.
But that's not always the case.
I like to call this blind championing of technology "trickle-down techonomics," to borrow a phrase.
(Laughter) We tend to think that if we design things for the select few, eventually those technologies will reach everyone, and that's not always the case.
Technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital.
They tend to consolidate in the hands of the few, and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many.
And so most of you aren't tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends, so I wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable.
In the world of wearables and smartphones and apps, there's a big movement to track people's personal health with applications that track the number of calories that you burn or whether you're sitting too much or walking enough.
These technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient, and in turn, these medical facilities are starting to expect these types of efficiencies.
As these digital tools find their way into medical rooms, and they become digitally ready, what happens to the digitally invisible?
What does the medical experience look like for someone who doesn't have the $400 phone or watch tracking their every movement?
Do they now become a burden on the medical system?
Is their experience changed?
In the world of finance, Bitcoin and crypto-currencies are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world, but the challenge with these technologies is the barrier to entry is incredibly high, right?
You need access to the same phones, devices, connectivity, and even where you don't, where you can find a proxy agent, usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate.
And so the question that I ask myself is, what happens to the last community using paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency?
Another example from my hometown in Philadelphia: I recently went to the public library there, and they are facing an existential crisis.
Public funding is dwindling, they have to reduce their footprint to stay open and stay relevant, and so one of the ways they're going about this is digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud.
This is great for most kids.
Right?
You can check out books from home, you can research on the way to school or from school, but these are really two big assumptions, that one, you have access at home, and two, that you have access to a mobile phone, and in Philadelphia, many kids do not.
So what does their education experience look like in the wake of a completely cloud-based library, what used to be considered such a basic part of education?
How do they stay competitive?
A final example from across the world in East Africa: there's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights, for a number of reasons.
Migrant communities, older generations dying off, and ultimately poor record-keeping have led to conflicts over who owns what.
And so there was a big movement to put all this information online, to track all the ownership of these plots of land, put them in the cloud, and give them to the communities.
But actually, the unintended consequence of this has been that venture capitalists, investors, real estate developers, have swooped in and they've begun buying up these plots of land right out from under these communities, because they have access to the technologies and the connectivity that makes that possible.
So that's the common thread that connects these examples, the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make.
As engineers, as technologists, we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy.
We think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing.
This needs to change.
We have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build, especially as they increasingly control the world in which we live.
In the late '90s, there was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking.
I think in 2014, we're long overdue for a similar movement in the area of tech and technology.
So, I just encourage you, as you are all thinking about the next big thing, as entrepreneurs, as CEOs, as engineers, as makers, that you think about the unintended consequences of the things that you're building, because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone.
Thank you.
(Applause)As a software developer and technologist, I've worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years.
Civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good, using technology to solve humanitarian problems.
This is in 2010 in Uganda, working on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones for expressing dissent.
That same technology was deployed later in North Africa for similar purposes to help activists stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control.
The tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions that if we build great things, it will positively affect everyone.
Eventually, these innovations will get out and find everyone.
But that's not always the case.
I like to call this blind championing of technology "trickle-down techonomics," to borrow a phrase.
(Laughter) We tend to think that if we design things for the select few, eventually those technologies will reach everyone, and that's not always the case.
Technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital.
They tend to consolidate in the hands of the few, and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many.
And so most of you aren't tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends, so I wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable.
In the world of wearables and smartphones and apps, there's a big movement to track people's personal health with applications that track the number of calories that you burn or whether you're sitting too much or walking enough.
These technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient, and in turn, these medical facilities are starting to expect these types of efficiencies.
As these digital tools find their way into medical rooms, and they become digitally ready, what happens to the digitally invisible?
What does the medical experience look like for someone who doesn't have the $400 phone or watch tracking their every movement?
Do they now become a burden on the medical system?
Is their experience changed?
In the world of finance, Bitcoin and crypto-currencies are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world, but the challenge with these technologies is the barrier to entry is incredibly high, right?
You need access to the same phones, devices, connectivity, and even where you don't, where you can find a proxy agent, usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate.

Thank you.
For example, the Department of Transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain.
Most city agencies give us statistics.
But did you ever think about where these numbers came from?
Because for these numbers to exist, someone at the city agency had to stop and say, hmm, here's a number that somebody might want want to know.
Here's a number that our citizens want to know.
In fact, in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city.
So you go and look at data like this, and instead of just counting the number of cabs, we can start to ask different questions.
So I had a question. When's rush hour in New York City?
It can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly?
And I thought to myself, these cabs aren't just numbers, these are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take.
You can see that from about midnight to around 5:18 in the morning, speed increases, and at that point, things turn around, and they get slower and slower and slower until about 8:35 in the morning, when they end up at around 11 and a half miles per hour.
Makes sense.
And the fact that it exists is amazing.
And this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero.
This data didn't just appear.
Yeah, I see some shakes.
John Krauss was like, I'm not going to copy and paste this data.
Now, the good news is that the de Blasio administration actually recently released this data a few months ago, and so now we can actually have access to it, but there's a lot of data still entombed in PDF.
This is an example of a map I made, and this is the dirtiest waterways in New York City.
Now, how do I measure dirty?
Number one: Never swim in anything that ends in "creek" or "canal.
It's on the other side.
And each one of these links is an Excel sheet, and each Excel sheet is different.
Every heading is different: you copy, paste, reorganize.
This is where 1,100 data sets that don't suffer from the things I just told you live, and that number is growing, and that's great.
You can download data in any format, be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.
So once again, you're spending time, even when we have this portal, you're spending time normalizing our address fields.
And that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it, so I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant and then something called a curb extension, which is like a seven-foot space to walk on, and then a parking spot.
And so these cars came along, and the hydrant -- "It's all the way over there, I'm fine," and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them.
" And I thought to myself, typical government response, all right, moved on with my life.
They repainted the spot, and for a second I thought I saw the future of open data, because think about what happened here.
And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog.
It's not, it's about being a partner.
All we need are a few changes.
If you're FOILing data, if you're seeing your data being FOILed over and over again, let's release it to the public, that's a sign that it should be made public.
And if you're a government agency releasing a PDF, let's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data, because that data is coming from somewhere.
I don't know where, but it's coming from somewhere, and you can release it with the PDF.
And let's adopt and share some open data standards.
Let's start with our addresses here in New York City.
We're actually quite close.
There are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now, active meetups.
There are thousands of people attending these meetups.
These people are going after work and on weekends, and they're attending these meetups to look at open data and make our city a better place.
Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week released something called citygram. nyc that allows you to subscribe to 311 complaints around your own home, or around your office.
You put in your address, you get local complaints.
And it's not just the tech community that are after these things.
It's urban planners like the students I teach at Pratt.
(Applause)Six thousand miles of road, 600 miles of subway track, 400 miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track, if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island.
These are the numbers that make up the infrastructure of New York City.
These are the statistics of our infrastructure.
They're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies.
For example, the Department of Transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain.
The MTA will boast how many miles of subway track there are.
Most city agencies give us statistics.
This is from a report this year from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, where we learn that there's about 13,500 taxis here in New York City. Pretty interesting, right?
But did you ever think about where these numbers came from?
Because for these numbers to exist, someone at the city agency had to stop and say, hmm, here's a number that somebody might want want to know.
Here's a number that our citizens want to know.
So they go back to their raw data, they count, they add, they calculate, and then they put out reports, and those reports will have numbers like this.
The problem is, how do they know all of our questions?
We have lots of questions.
In fact, in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city.
The agencies can never keep up.
So the paradigm isn't exactly working, and I think our policymakers realize that, because in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country.
In a lot of ways, he's right.
In the last two years, the city has released 1,000 datasets on our open data portal, and it's pretty awesome.
So you go and look at data like this, and instead of just counting the number of cabs, we can start to ask different questions.
So I had a question. When's rush hour in New York City?
It can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly?
And I thought to myself, these cabs aren't just numbers, these are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take.
There's data there, and I looked at that data, and I made a plot of the average speed of taxis in New York City throughout the day.
You can see that from about midnight to around 5:18 in the morning, speed increases, and at that point, things turn around, and they get slower and slower and slower until about 8:35 in the morning, when they end up at around 11 and a half miles per hour.
The average taxi is going 11 and a half miles per hour on our city streets, and it turns out it stays that way for the entire day.
(Laughter) So I said to myself, I guess there's no rush hour in New York City.
There's just a rush day.
Makes sense.
And this is important for a couple of reasons.
If you're a transportation planner, this might be pretty interesting to know.
But if you want to get somewhere quickly, you now know to set your alarm for 4:45 in the morning and you're all set.
New York, right?
But there's a story behind this data.
This data wasn't just available, it turns out.
It actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request, or a FOIL Request.
This is a form you can find on the Taxi and Limousine Commission website.
In order to access this data, you need to go get this form, fill it out, and they will notify you, and a guy named Chris Whong did exactly that.
Chris went down, and they told him, "Just bring a brand new hard drive down to our office, leave it here for five hours, we'll copy the data and you take it back.
" And that's where this data came from.
Now, Chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public, and so it ended up online for all to use, and that's where this graph came from.
And the fact that it exists is amazing.
And we can do better than that as a city.
Now, not every dataset is behind a FOIL Request.
Here is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City based on cyclist accidents.
And this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero.
This is exactly what we're looking for.
How many of you guys know this logo?
John Krauss was like, I'm not going to copy and paste this data.
I'm going to write a program.
For example, our crime data is still only available in PDF.
What you see is inland waterways.
That makes sense, right?
And the bigger circles are dirty.
And I learned a few things from this.
Number one: Never swim in anything that ends in "creek" or "canal.
" But number two: I also found the dirtiest waterway in New York City, by this measure, one measure.
In Coney Island Creek, which is not the Coney Island you swim in, luckily.
It's on the other side.
But Coney Island Creek, 94 percent of samples taken over the last five years have had fecal levels so high that it would be against state law to swim in the water.
And this is not the kind of fact that you're going to see boasted in a city report, right?
It's not going to be the front page on nyc. gov. You're not going to see it there, but the fact that we can get to that data is awesome.
But once again, it wasn't super easy, because this data was not on the open data portal.
If you were to go to the open data portal, you'd see just a snippet of it, a year or a few months.
It was actually on the Department of Environmental Protection's website.
And each one of these links is an Excel sheet, and each Excel sheet is different.
Every heading is different: you copy, paste, reorganize.
When you do you can make maps and that's great, but once again, we can do better than that as a city, we can normalize things.
And we're getting there, because there's this website that Socrata makes called the Open Data Portal NYC.
This is where 1,100 data sets that don't suffer from the things I just told you live, and that number is growing, and that's great.
You can download data in any format, be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.
Whatever you want, you can download the data that way.
The problem is, once you do, you will find that each agency codes their addresses differently.
So one is street name, intersection street, street, borough, address, building, building address.
So once again, you're spending time, even when we have this portal, you're spending time normalizing our address fields.
And that's not the best use of our citizens' time.
We can do better than that as a city.
We can standardize our addresses, and if we do, we can get more maps like this.
This is a map of fire hydrants in New York City, but not just any fire hydrants.
These are the top 250 grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets.
(Laughter) So I learned a few things from this map, and I really like this map.
Number one, just don't park on the Upper East Side.
Just don't. It doesn't matter where you park, you will get a hydrant ticket.
Number two, I found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of New York City, and they're on the Lower East Side, and they were bringing in over 55,000 dollars a year in parking tickets.
And that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it, so I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant and then something called a curb extension, which is like a seven-foot space to walk on, and then a parking spot.
And so these cars came along, and the hydrant -- "It's all the way over there, I'm fine," and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them.
They would park there, and the NYPD disagreed with this designation and would ticket them.
And it wasn't just me who found a parking ticket. This is the Google Street View car driving by finding the same parking ticket.
So I wrote about this on my blog, on I Quant NY, and the DOT responded, and they said, "While the DOT has not received any complaints about this location, we will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations.
" And I thought to myself, typical government response, all right, moved on with my life.
But then, a few weeks later, something incredible happened.
They repainted the spot, and for a second I thought I saw the future of open data, because think about what happened here.
For five years, this spot was being ticketed, and it was confusing, and then a citizen found something, they told the city, and within a few weeks the problem was fixed.
It's amazing.
And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog.
It's not, it's about being a partner.
We can empower our citizens to be better partners for government, and it's not that hard.
All we need are a few changes.
If you're FOILing data, if you're seeing your data being FOILed over and over again, let's release it to the public, that's a sign that it should be made public.
And if you're a government agency releasing a PDF, let's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data, because that data is coming from somewhere.
I don't know where, but it's coming from somewhere, and you can release it with the PDF.
And let's adopt and share some open data standards.
Let's start with our addresses here in New York City.
Let's just start normalizing our addresses.
Because New York is a leader in open data.
Despite all this, we are absolutely a leader in open data, and if we start normalizing things, and set an open data standard, others will follow.
The state will follow, and maybe the federal government, Other countries could follow, and we're not that far off from a time where you could write one program and map information from 100 countries.
It's not science fiction.
We're actually quite close.
And by the way, who are we empowering with this?
Because it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong.
There are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now, active meetups.
There are thousands of people attending these meetups.
These people are going after work and on weekends, and they're attending these meetups to look at open data and make our city a better place.
Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week released something called citygram. nyc that allows you to subscribe to 311 complaints around your own home, or around your office.
You put in your address, you get local complaints.
And it's not just the tech community that are after these things.
It's urban planners like the students I teach at Pratt.
It's policy advocates, it's everyone, it's citizens from a diverse set of backgrounds.
And with some small, incremental changes, we can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens to harness open data and make our city even better, whether it's one dataset, or one parking spot at a time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Well, it depends on what you think of as our bodies. Is it our cells?
So why might we want to do this? Well, it turns out that microbes are not just important for finding out where we are in terms of our health, but they can actually cure disease.
This is one of the newest things we've been able to visualize with colleagues at the University of Minnesota.
So let's watch exactly what happens there.
Four of those patients are about to get a transplant from that healthy donor at the bottom, and what you can see is that immediately, you have this radical change in the gut community.
So one day after you do that transplant, all those symptoms clear up, the diarrhea vanishes, and they're essentially healthy again, coming to resemble the donor's community, and they stay there. (Applause) So we're just at the beginning of this discovery.
We're just finding out that microbes have implications for all these different kinds of diseases, ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to obesity, and perhaps even autism and depression.

I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency. (Laughter) Groucho Marx said, "Why should I care about future generations?
What have they ever done for me?
So some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish. But are we really all just like rascals?
That's good news, isn't it?
Many philosophers, like Hobbes, have said so. But not everyone looks like a rascal. Or is man a wolf for man? But this guy doesn't seem too bad.
He's one of my friends in Tibet. He's very kind. So now, we love cooperation. There's no better joy than working together, is there?
Automatic behavior.It's neither selfish nor altruistic.No choice? Well of course, this guy's not going to think for half an hour, "Should I give my hand? Not give my hand? " He does it.
Individual change is possible. Now do we have to wait for an altruistic gene to be in the human race?
So where do we go from there?Myself, I will go back to the East. Now we treat 100,000 patients a year in our projects. We have 25,000 kids in school, four percent overhead. Some people say, "Well, your stuff works in practice, but does it work in theory?
" There's always positive deviance. So I will also go back to my hermitage to find the inner resources to better serve others. But on the more global level, what can we do? We need three things.

Guatemala is recovering from a 36-year armed conflict.
A conflict that was fought during the Cold War.
It was really just a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state.
They want the bodies of their loved ones.
We left Guatemala and we came here.
So I grew up in New York, I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact, and I went to New Utrecht High School and I graduated from Brooklyn College.
The only thing was that I really didn't know what was happening in Guatemala.
I didn't care for it; it was too painful.
So I went back.
I went back to Guatemala, to look for the bodies, to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well.
We let them decide to tell us the stories, to tell us what they saw, to tell us about their loved ones.
So here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head or a machete wound, for example.
Whether it's a baby, or an adult.
Now that's going to come into play in a second. What we did is we conducted an exhumation in 2003, where we exhumed 220 bodies from 53 graves in a military base. Grave 9, though, matched the family of Sergio Saul Linares.
Okay?
What we have as a result is 200,000 civilian victims, 160,000 of those killed in the communities: small children, men, women, the elderly even.
But the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us, the police, the military, are the ones that committed most of the crimes.
So here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head or a machete wound, for example.
But when we're done with that analysis what we'll do is we'll take a small fragment of the bone and we'll extract DNA from it.
The first is the case of the military diary.
And that immediately made us think, my goodness, where is there a case like this?
When I got to Guatemala in 1995, I heard of a case of a massacre that happened on May 14, 1982, where the army came in, killed the men, and took the women and children in helicopters to an unknown location.
But we're doing more than that.
We have to now come together and decide that we're not going to have any more missing.
So no more missing, guys.
Okay?
No more missing.
Thank you. (Applause)
Slavery, the treatment of human beings as property, deprived of personal rights, has occurred in many forms throughout the world.
But one institution stands out for both its global scale and its lasting legacy.
The Atlantic slave trade, occurring from the late 15th to the mid 19th century and spanning three continents, forcibly brought more than 10 million Africans to the Americas.
The impact it would leave affected not only these slaves and their descendants, but the economies and histories of large parts of the world.
There had been centuries of contact between Europe and Africa via the Mediterranean.
But the Atlantic slave trade began in the late 1400s with Portuguese colonies in West Africa, and Spanish settlement of the Americas shortly after.
The crops grown in the new colonies, sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton, were labor intensive, and there were not enough settlers or indentured servants to cultivate all the new land.
American Natives were enslaved, but many died from new diseases, while others effectively resisted.
And so to meet the massive demand for labor, the Europeans looked to Africa.
African slavery had existed for centuries in various forms.
Some slaves were indentured servants, with a limited term and the chance to buy one's freedom.
Others were more like European serfs.
In some societies, slaves could be part of a master's family, own land, and even rise to positions of power.
But when white captains came offering manufactured goods, weapons, and rum for slaves, African kings and merchants had little reason to hesitate.
They viewed the people they sold not as fellow Africans but criminals, debtors, or prisoners of war from rival tribes.
By selling them, kings enriched their own realms, and strengthened them against neighboring enemies.
African kingdoms prospered from the slave trade, but meeting the European's massive demand created intense competition.
Slavery replaced other criminal sentences, and capturing slaves became a motivation for war, rather than its result.
To defend themselves from slave raids, neighboring kingdoms needed European firearms, which they also bought with slaves.
The slave trade had become an arms race, altering societies and economies across the continent.
As for the slaves themselves, they faced unimaginable brutality.
After being marched to slave forts on the coast, shaved to prevent lice, and branded, they were loaded onto ships bound for the Americas.
About 20% of them would never see land again.
Most captains of the day were tight packers, cramming as many men as possible below deck.
While the lack of sanitation caused many to die of disease, and others were thrown overboard for being sick, or as discipline, the captain's ensured their profits by cutting off slave's ears as proof of purchase.
Some captives took matters into their own hands.
Many inland Africans had never seen whites before, and thought them to be cannibals, constantly taking people away and returning for more.
Afraid of being eaten, or just to avoid further suffering, they committed suicide or starved themselves, believing that in death, their souls would return home.
Those who survived were completley dehumanized, treated as mere cargo.
Women and children were kept above deck and abused by the crew, while the men were made to perform dances in order to keep them exercised and curb rebellion.
What happened to those Africans who reached the New World and how the legacy of slavery still affects their descendants today is fairly well known.
But what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade had on Africa's future.
Not only did the continent lose tens of millions of its able-bodied population, but because most of the slaves taken were men, the long-term demographic effect was even greater.
When the slave trade was finally outlawed in the Americas and Europe, the African kingdoms whose economies it had come to dominate collapsed, leaving them open to conquest and colonization.
And the increased competition and influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability that continues to this day.
The Atlantic slave trade also contributed to the development of racist ideology.
Most African slavery had no deeper reason than legal punishment or intertribal warfare, but the Europeans who preached a universal religion, and who had long ago outlawed enslaving fellow Christians, needed justification for a practice so obviously at odds with their ideals of equality.
So they claimed that Africans were biologically inferior and destined to be slaves, making great efforts to justify this theory.
Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas acquired a racial basis, making it impossible for slaves and their future descendants to attain equal status in society.
I'm going to show you a photograph of a person, just for a second or two, and I'd like for you to identify what emotion is on his face.
Well, we actually surveyed over 120 individuals, and the results were mixed.
We might see something entirely different, because perception is subjective.
What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye.
Of course, there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind's eye.
I'm going to give you just a few.
So dieters, for instance, see apples as larger than people who are not counting calories. Softball players see the ball as smaller if they've just come out of a slump, compared to people who had a hot night at the plate.
But we have to clarify and make sense of what it is that we see, and it's our mind that helps us fill in that gap. As a result, perception is a subjective experience, and that's how we end up seeing through our own mind's eye.
And does that even matter?
We were really excited because it meant that this strategy helped make the exercise look easier, but the big question was, could this help make exercise actually better?Could it improve the quality of exercise as well?
So I started working with refugees because I wanted to make a difference, and making a difference starts with telling their stories.
Who bombed your house?
Who killed your son?
Did the rest of your family make it out alive?
How are you coping in your life in exile?
But there's one question that always seems to me to be most revealing, and that is: What did you take?
What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town, and the armed gangs were approaching your house?
A Syrian refugee boy I know told me that he didn't hesitate when his life was in imminent danger.
He took his high school diploma, and later he told me why.
He said, "I took my high school diploma because my life depended on it.
" And he would risk his life to get that diploma.
On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.
His classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling, and his mother told me, "Every day, I would say to him every morning, 'Honey, please don't go to school. '" And when he insisted, she said, "I would hug him as if it were for the last time.
" But he said to his mother, "We're all afraid, but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear.
" But one day, the family got terrible news.
Hany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house.
Their throats were slit.
It was time to flee. They left that day, right away, in their car, Hany hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers.
And they would cross the border into Lebanon, where they would find peace.
But they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony.
They had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field, and this is Hany's brother Ashraf, who plays outside.
And that day, they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world, in a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.
It only has four million citizens, and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.
Think about it this way, proportionately.
It would be as if the entire population of Germany, 80 million people, would flee to the United States in just three years.
Half of the entire population of Syria is now uprooted, most of them inside the country.
Six and a half million people have fled for their lives.
Over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries, and only a small proportion, as you see, have moved on to Europe.
What I find most worrying is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.
I took this picture of this little girl.
It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.
And most troubling of all is that only 20 percent of Syrian refugee children are in school in Lebanon.
And yet, Syrian refugee children, all refugee children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives.
Why?
Because it allows them to think of their future rather than the nightmare of their past.
It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.
I'm reminded of a recent visit I took to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq, and I met this girl, and I thought, "She's beautiful," and I went up to her and asked her, "Can I take your picture?
" And she said yes, but she refused to smile.
I think she couldn't, because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Syrian refugee children, a generation isolated and frustrated.
And yet, look at what they fled: utter destruction, buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.
Hany's home was also destroyed.
This will need to be rebuilt by architects, by engineers, by electricians.
Communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge.
Shouldn't this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake, the societies in exile, the refugees?
Refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return.
You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state.
Well far from it.
With wars going on and on, the average time a refugee will spend in exile is 17 years.
Hany was into his second year in limbo when I went to visit him recently, and we conducted our entire conversation in English, which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of Dan Brown's novels and from listening to American rap.
We also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.
But I'll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day. He said to me, "If I am not a student, I am nothing.
" Hany is one of 50 million people uprooted in this world today. Never since World War II have so many people been forcibly displaced.
So while we're making sweeping progress in human health, in technology, in education and design, we are doing dangerously little to help the victims and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes.
And there are more and more victims.
Every day, on average, by the end of this day, 32,000 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes — 32,000 people. They flee across borders like this one.
We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan, and this is a typical day.
Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats, risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in Europe.
This Syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized — most of the people drowned — and he told us, "Syrians are just looking for a quiet place where nobody hurts you, where nobody humiliates you, and where nobody kills you.
" Well, I think that should be the minimum.
How about a place of healing, of learning, and even opportunity?
So wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees.
And all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border.
(Applause) Thank you.
But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive.
We can help them thrive.
We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end.
Rather, as centers of excellence, where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation.
It makes so much sense, but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia that has been raging on for 22 years.
And imagine living in this camp.
I visited this camp.
It's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia, and it was so remote that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.
It was dusty and it was terribly hot.
And we went to visit a school and started talking to the children, and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.
And I asked her the questions that grown-ups ask kids, like, "What is your favorite subject?
" and, "What do you want to be when you grow up?
" And this is when her face turned blank, and she said to me, "I have no future.
My schooling days are over.
" And I thought, there must be some misunderstanding, so I turned to my colleague and she confirmed to me there is no funding for secondary education in this camp.
And how I wished at that moment that I could say to her, "We will build you a school.
" And I also thought, what a waste.
She should be and she is the future of Somalia.
A boy named Jacob Atem had a different chance, but not before he experienced terribly tragedy.
He watched — this is in Sudan — as his village — he was only seven years old — burned to the ground, and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were killed that day.
But his life changed when he got the chance to be resettled to the United States, and he found love in a foster family and he was able to go to school, and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university.
So I want to take you back to Hany.
When I told him I was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the TED stage, he allowed me to read you a poem that he sent in an email to me.
He wrote: "I miss myself, my friends, times of reading novels or writing poems, birds and tea in the morning.
My room, my books, myself, and everything that was making me smile.
Oh, oh, I had so many dreams that were about to be realized.
" So here is my point: Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity.
Leave them abandoned, and they risk exploitation and abuse, and leave them unskilled and uneducated, and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries.
I believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world.
The victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace, and it's the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence.
Hany is at a tipping point.
We would love to help him go to university and to become an engineer, but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life: tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets, food rations and a bit of medicine.
University is a luxury.
Thank you.
So imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies, and if you knew how to stop that, would you?
Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five, and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn't some smart, new technological innovations. It's one of the world's oldest inventions: a bar of soap.
Pretty yucky, you would agree with me.
And the same way, we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets, running water, and soap available, it's the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high.
Is there no soap?
Children pick up disease in the place that's supposed to love them and protect them the most, in their homes.
Every second in Asia and Africa, 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family.
I think I'm probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health, and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap.
I can't imagine anything more powerful and more painful.
This one is from Myanmar.
She had the most beautiful smile, the smile, I think, that life gives you when you've had a second chance.
Her son, Myo, is her second one.
And that's what inspires me, inspires me to continue in this mission, to know that I can equip her with what's needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world: nurturing her newborn.
And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family, don't look far: buy her soap.
It's the most beautiful invention in public health.
I hope you will join us and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like Myo reach their fifth birthday.
Thank you.
(Applause)
No wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people.
No wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people.
And using these simple improvisations, today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone. Today, we are making forests in houses, in schools, even in factories with the corporates. But that's not enough.
There is a huge number of people who want to take matters into their own hands.
So we let it happen.
This methodology, I believe, has a potential. By sharing, we can actually bring back our native forests. Now, when you go back home, if you see a barren piece of land, do remember that it can be a potential forest.
Thank you very much. Thanks. (Applause)
In Kenya, 1984 is known as the year of the cup, or the goro goro.
The goro goro is a cup used to measure two kilograms of maize flower on the market, and the maize flower is used to make ugali, a polenta-like cake that is eaten together with vegetables.
Both the maize and the vegetables are grown on most Kenyan farms, which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm.
One goro goro can feed three meals for an average family, and in 1984, the whole harvest could fit in one goro goro.
It was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory.
Now today, I insure farmers against droughts like those in the year of the cup, or to be more specific, I insure the rains.
I come from a family of missionaries who built hospitals in Indonesia, and my father built a psychiatric hospital in Tanzania.
This is me, age five, in front of that hospital.
I don't think they thought I'd grow up to sell insurance.
(Laughter) So let me tell you how that happened.
In 2008, I was working for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda, and my boss had just been promoted to become the minister.
She launched an ambitious plan to start a green revolution in her country, and before we knew it, we were importing tons of fertilizer and seed and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer and plant.
A couple of weeks later, the International Monetary Fund visited us, and asked my minister, "Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers reach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?
" My minister answered proudly and somewhat defiantly, "I am going to pray for rain.
" That ended the discussion.
On the way back to the ministry in the car, she turned around to me and said, "Rose, you've always been interested in finance.
Go find us some insurance.
" It's been six years since, and last year I was fortunate enough to be part of a team that insured over 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda against drought.
They owned an average of half an acre and paid on average two Euros in premium.
It's microinsurance.
Now, traditional insurance doesn't work with two to three Euros of premium, because traditional insurance relies on farm visits.
A farmer here in Germany would be visited for the start of the season, halfway through, and at the end, and again if there was a loss, to estimate the damages.
For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa, the maths of doing those visits simply don't add up.
So instead, we rely on technology and data.
This satellite measures whether there were clouds or not, because think about it: If there are clouds, then you might have some rain, but if there are no clouds, then it's actually impossible for it to rain.
These images show the onset of the rains this season in Kenya.
You see that around March 6, the clouds move in and then disappear, and then around the March 11, the clouds really move in.
That, and those clouds, were the onset of the rains this year.
For example, for maize at planting, you need to have two days of rain for farmers to plant, and then it needs to rain once every two weeks for the crop to properly germinate.
After that, you need rain every three weeks for the crop to form its leaves, whereas at flowering, you need it to rain more frequently, about once every 10 days for the crop to form its cob.
At the end of the season, you actually don't want it to rain, because rains then can damage the crop.
Devising such a cover is difficult, but it turned out the real challenge was selling insurance.
We set ourselves a modest target of 500 farmers insured after our first season.
After a couple of months' intense marketing, we had signed up the grand total of 185 farmers.
I was disappointed and confounded.
Everybody kept telling me that farmers wanted insurance, but our prime customers simply weren't buying.
They were waiting to see what would happen, didn't trust insurance companies, or thought, "I've managed for so many years.
Why would I buy insurance now?
" Now many of you know microcredit, the method of providing small loans to poor people pioneered by Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Grameen Bank.
Turns out, selling microcredit isn't the same as selling insurance.
For credit, a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank, and if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.
That's an attractive proposition.
For insurance, the farmer needs to trust the insurance company, and needs to advance the insurance company money.
It's a very different value proposition.
And so the uptick of insurance has been slow, with so far only 4.4 percent of Africans taking up insurance in 2012, and half of that number is in one country, South Africa.
We tried for some years selling insurance directly to farmers, with very high marketing cost and very limited success.
Then we realized that there were many organizations working with farmers: seed companies, microfinance institutions, mobile phone companies, government agencies.
They were all providing loans to farmers, and often, just before they'd finalize the loan, the farmer would say, "But what if it doesn't rain?
How do you expect me to repay my loan?
" Many of these organizations were taking on the risk themselves, simply hoping that that year, the worst wouldn't happen.
Most of the organizations, however, were limiting their growth in agriculture.
They couldn't take on this kind of risk.
These organizations became our customers, and when combining credit and insurance, interesting things can happen.
Let me tell you one more story.
At the start of February 2012 in western Kenya, the rains started, and they started early, and when rains start early, farmers are encouraged, because it usually means that the season is going to be good.
So they took out loans and planted.
For the next three weeks, there wasn't a single drop of rain, and the crops that had germinated so well shriveled and died.
We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution that had provided those loans to about 6,000 farmers in that area, and we called them up and said, "Look, we know about the drought.
We've got you.
We'll give you 200,000 Euros at the end of the season.
" They said, "Wow, that's great, but that'll be late.
Could you give us the money now?
Then these farmers can still replant and can get a harvest this season.
" So we convinced our insurance partners, and later that April, these farmers replanted.
A satellite would then measure the rainfall for the next three weeks, and if it didn't rain, we'd replace their seed.
One of the first — (Applause) — Hold on, I'm not there!
One of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was Bosco Mwinyi.
We visited his farm later that August, and I wish I could show you the smile on his face when he showed us his harvest, because it warmed my heart and it made me realize why selling insurance can be a good thing.
But you know, he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture, so we had to zoom out a lot.
Insurance secured his harvest that season, and I believe that today, we have all the tools to enable African farmers to take control of their own destiny.
No more years of the cup.
Instead, I am looking forward to, at least somehow, the year of the insurance, or the year of the great harvest. Thank you. (Applause)
These are simple objects: clocks, keys, combs, glasses.
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey.
We are all familiar with these mundane, everyday objects.
The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them.
Usually, they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war. These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland, and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves, 20 years after the war.
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.
During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s, approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians, went missing, presumed killed, and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations.
Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities, when U. N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army.
The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide.
Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial, political, religious or ethnic group.
As much as genocide is about killing. It is also about destroying their property, their cultural heritage, and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.
Genocide is not only about the killing; it is about the denied identity.
There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime.
Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified.
Once recovered, these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned, analyzed, catalogued and stored.
Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI.
As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community. I like to move beyond raising awareness. And in this case, someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened.
Photography is about empathy, and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy.
In this case, I am merely a tool, a forensic, if you like, and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document.
Once all the missing persons are identified, only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain.
In all their simplicity, these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims, the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
How do you know you're real?
It's an obvious question until you try to answer it, but let's take it seriously.
How do you really know you exist?
In his "Meditations on First Philosophy," René Descartes tried to answer that very question, demolishing all his preconceived notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations.
All his knowledge had come from his sensory perceptions of the world.
Same as you, right?
You know you're watching this video with your eyes, hearing it with your ears.
Your senses show you the world as it is.
They aren't deceiving you, but sometimes they do.
You might mistake a person far away for someone else, or you're sure you're about to catch a flyball, and it hits the ground in front of you.
But come on, right here and now, you know what's right in front of you is real.
Your eyes, your hands, your body: that's you.
Only crazy people would deny that, and you know you're not crazy.
Anyone who'd doubt that must be dreaming.
Oh no, what if you're dreaming?
Dreams feel real.
You can believe you're swimming, flying or fighting off monsters with your bare hands, when your real body is lying in bed.
No, no, no.
When you're awake, you know you're awake.
Ah!
But when you aren't, you don't know you aren't, so you can't prove you aren't dreaming.
Maybe the body you perceive yourself to have isn't really there.
Maybe all of reality, even its abstract concepts, like time, shape, color and number are false, all just deceptions concocted by an evil genius!
No, seriously.
Descartes asks if you can disprove the idea that an evil genius demon has tricked you into believing reality is real.
Perhaps this diabolical deceiver has duped you.
The world, your perceptions of it, your very body.
You can't disprove that they're all just made up, and how could you exist without them?
You couldn't!
So, you don't.
Life is but a dream, and I bet you aren't row, row, rowing the boat merrily at all, are you?
No, you're rowing it wearily like the duped, nonexistent doof you are/aren't.
Do you find that convincing?
You can't be nothing if you think you're something, even if you think that something is nothing because no matter what you think, you're a thinking thing, or as Descartes put it, "I think, therefore I am," and so are you, really. (Airplane engine)
I would like to share with you a new model of higher education, a model that, once expanded, can enhance the collective intelligence of millions of creative and motivated individuals that otherwise would be left behind.
Look at the world.
Pick a place and focus on it.
You will find humans chasing higher education.
Let's meet some of them. Patrick. Patrick was born in Liberia to a family of 20 children.
During the civil war, he and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria.
There, in spite of his situation, he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades.
He wanted to continue to higher education, but due to his family living on the poverty line, he was soon sent to South Africa to work and send back money to feed his family.
Patrick never gave up his dream of higher education.
Late at night, after work, he surfed the net, looking for ways to study.
Meet Debbie.
Debbie is from Florida.
Her parents didn't go to college, and neither did any of her siblings.
Debbie has worked all her life, pays taxes, supports herself month to month, proud of the American dream, a dream that just won't be complete without higher education.
But Debbie doesn't have the savings for higher education.
She can't pay the tuition. Neither could she leave work.
Meet Wael.
Wael is from Syria.
He's experiencing firsthand the misery, fear and failure imposed on his country.
He's a big believer in education.
He knew that if he could find an opportunity for higher education, an opportunity to get ahead of the rest, he has a better chance to survive in a world turned upside down.
The higher education system failed Patrick, Debbie and Wael, exactly as it is failing millions of potential students -- millions that graduate high school, millions that are qualified for higher education, millions that want to study yet cannot access it for various reasons.
First: financial.
Universities are expensive; we all know it.
In large parts of the world, higher education is unattainable for an average citizen.
This is probably the biggest problem facing our society.
Higher education stopped being a right for all and became a privilege for the few.
Second: cultural. Students who are qualified for higher education can afford -- want to study -- cannot, because it is not decent, it is not a place for a woman.
This is the story of countless women in Africa, for example, prevented from higher education because of cultural barriers.
And here comes the third reason: UNESCO stated that in 2025, 100 million students will be deprived of higher education, simply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them, to meet the demand.
They will take a placement test, they will pass it, but they still won't have access, because there are no places available.
Patrick, Debbie and Wael are only three examples out of the 1,700 accepted students from 143 countries. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) We didn't need to reinvent the wheel.
We just looked at what wasn't working and used the amazing power of the Internet to get around it.
We set out to build a model that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education. And that's how we did it.
First, bricks and mortar cost money.
Universities have expenses that virtual universities don't.
We don't need to pass these expenses on to our students.
They don't exist.
We also don't need to worry about capacity. There are no limits of seats in virtual university.
Actually, nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall. Textbooks are also something our students don't need to buy.
By using open educational resources and the generosity of professors who are putting their material up free and accessible, we don't need to send our students to buy textbooks.
All of our materials come free.
Even professors, the most expensive line in any university balance sheet, come free to our students.
Over 3,000 of them, including presidents, vice chancellors, professors and academic advisers from top universities such as NYU, Yale, Berkeley and Oxford, came on board to help our students.
Finally, is our belief in peer-to-peer learning.
We use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together, and also to reduce the time our professors need to labor over class assignments.
If the Internet has made us a global village, this model can develop its future leadership.
Look how we do it.
We only offer two programs: business administration and computer science, the two programs most in demand worldwide, the two programs that are likeliest to help our students find a job.
When our students are accepted, they are placed in a small classroom of 20 to 30 students, to ensure that those who need personalized attention get it.
Moreover, for every nine-week course, they meet a new peer, a whole new set of students from all over the world.
Every week, when they go into the classroom, they find the lecture notes of the week, the reading assignment, the homework assignment, and the discussion question, which is the core of our studies.
Every week, every student must contribute to the class discussion, and also must comment on the contribution of others.
This way, we open our students' minds, we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures.
By the end of each week, the students take a quiz, hand in their homework, which are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors, get a grade, move to the next week.
By the end of the course, they take the final exam, get a grade, and follow to the next course.
We open the gates for higher education for every qualified student.
Every student with a high school diploma, sufficient English and Internet connection can study with us.
We don't use audio, we don't use video.
Broadband is not necessary.
Any student from any part of the world with any Internet connection can study with us.
We are tuition free.
All we ask our students to cover is the cost of their exams, 100 dollars per exam.
A full-time bachelor's degree student taking 40 courses will pay 1,000 dollars a year, 4,000 dollars for the entire degree.
And for those who cannot afford even this, we offer them a variety of scholarships.
It is our mission that nobody will be left behind for financial reasons.
With 5,000 students in 2016, this model is financially sustainable. Five years ago, it was a vision.
Today, it is a reality.
Last month, we got the ultimate academic endorsement to our model.
University of the People is now fully accredited.
I invite universities and, even more important, developing countries' governments, to replicate this model to ensure that the gates of higher education will open widely.
A new era is coming -- an era that will witness the disruption of the higher education model as we know it today, from being a privilege for the few to becoming a basic right, affordable and accessible for all.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music) This is the human test, a test to see if you are a human. Please raise your hand if something applies to you. Are we agreed?
Yes?
Then let's begin. Have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood?
(Laughter) It's okay, it's safe here. Have you ever made a small, weird sound when you remembered something embarrassing?
Have you ever purposely lowercased the first letter of a text in order to come across as sad or disappointed?
(Laughter) Okay. Have you ever ended a text with a period as a sign of aggression? Okay. Period. Have you ever laughed or smiled when someone said something shitty to you and then spent the rest of the day wondering why you reacted that way?
Yes. Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket a thousand times as you walked from the check-in to the gate?
Yes. Have you ever put on a pair of pants and then much later realized that there was a loose sock smushed up against your thigh?
(Laughter) Good. Have you ever tried to guess someone else's password so many times that it locked their account? Mmm. Have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day you will be discovered as a fraud?
Yes, it's safe here. Have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn't discovered yet that you were just naturally great at? Mmm. Have you ever broken something in real life, and then found yourself looking for an "undo" button in real life?
Have you ever stared at your phone smiling like an idiot while texting with someone?
Have you ever subsequently texted that person the phrase "I'm staring at the phone smiling like an idiot"?
Have you ever been tempted to, and then gave in to the temptation, of looking through someone else's phone?
Have you ever had a conversation with yourself and then suddenly realized you're a real asshole to yourself?
(Laughter) Has your phone ever run out of battery in the middle of an argument, and it sort of felt like the phone was breaking up with both of you?
Have you ever thought that working on an issue between you was futile because it should just be easier than this, or this is supposed to happen just naturally?
Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run, just happens naturally?
Have you ever woken up blissfully and suddenly been flooded by the awful remembrance that someone had left you?
It was less than a year after September 11, and I was at the Chicago Tribune writing about shootings and murders, and it was leaving me feeling pretty dark and depressed.
I had done some activism in college, so I decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing.
I thought it would be a safe way to do something positive, but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever, and we were all arrested.
Police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence.
My charges were dismissed, but a few weeks later, two FBI agents knocked on my door, and they told me that unless I helped them by spying on protest groups, they would put me on a domestic terrorist list.
I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch, but I was terrified, and when my fear subsided, I became obsessed with finding out how this happened, how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the FBI's number one domestic terrorism threat.
These are everyday people, like these protesters in Italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing.
And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular, so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word, eco-terrorist, to shift how we view them. They just made it up.
Now these companies have backed new laws like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits.
The rest were outside at a new memorial.
They were praising Dr. King as his style of activism was branded as terrorism if done in the name of animals or the environment.
Supporters say laws like this are needed for the extremists: the vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.
But right now, companies like TransCanada are briefing police in presentations like this one about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters as terrorists.
The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism are not about violence, they're about public relations.
Today, in multiple countries, corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms.
The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago, and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism.
The first of these ag-gag prosecutions, as they're called, was a young woman named Amy Meyer, and Amy saw a sick cow being moved by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse as she was on the public street.
And Amy did what any of us would: She filmed it.
When I found out about her story, I wrote about it, and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges.
But apparently, even exposing stuff like that is a threat.
Through the Freedom of Information Act, I learned that the counter-terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one.
They even included this nice little write-up of my book.
They described it as "compelling and well-written.
" (Applause) Blurb on the next book, right?
The point of all of this is to make us afraid, but as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith in the power of education.
Our best weapon is sunlight.
Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.
Over and over throughout history, people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Election night 2008 was a night that tore me in half.
It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.
[One hundred and forty-three] years after the end of slavery, and [43] years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, an African-American was elected president.
Many of us never thought that this was possible until the moment that it happened.
And in many ways, it was the climax of the black civil rights movement in the United States.
I was in California that night, which was ground zero at the time for another movement: the marriage equality movement.
Gay marriage was on the ballot in the form of Proposition 8, and as the election returns started to come in, it became clear that the right for same sex couples to marry, which had recently been granted by the California courts, was going to be taken away.
So on the same night that Barack Obama won his historic presidency, the lesbian and gay community suffered one of our most painful defeats.
And then it got even worse.
Pretty much immediately, African-Americans started to be blamed for the passage of Proposition 8. This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said that blacks had voted for the measure by something like 70 percent.
This turned out not to be true, but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in, and was grabbed on by the media.
I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage.
I listened to some gay commentator say that the African-American community was notoriously homophobic, and now that civil rights had been achieved for us, we wanted to take away other people's rights.
There were even reports of racist epithets being thrown at some of the participants of the gay rights rallies that took place after the election.
And on the other side, some African-Americans dismissed or ignored homophobia that was indeed real in our community.
And others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights, and once again, the sinking feeling that two minority groups of which I'm both a part of were competing with each other instead of supporting each other overwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.
Now, I'm a documentary filmmaker, so after going through my pissed off stage and yelling at the television and radio, my next instinct was to make a movie.
And what guided me in making this film was, how was this happening?
How was it that the gay rights movement was being pitted against the civil rights movement?
And this wasn't just an abstract question.
I'm a beneficiary of both movements, so this was actually personal.
But then something else happened after that election in 2008. The march towards gay equality accelerated at a pace that surprised and shocked everyone, and is still reshaping our laws and our policies, our institutions and our entire country.
Let's just look at a few of these strategies.
First off, it's really interesting to see, to actually visually see, how quick the gay rights movement has made its gains, if you look at a few of the major events on a timeline of both freedom movements.
Now, there are tons of milestones in the civil rights movement, but the first one we're going to start with is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.
This was a protest campaign against Montgomery, Alabama's segregation on their public transit system, and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person.
The campaign lasted a year, and it galvanized the civil rights movement like nothing had before it.
And I call this strategy the "I'm tired of your foot on my neck" strategy.
So gays and lesbians have been in society since societies began, but up until the mid-20th century, homosexual acts were still illegal in most states.
So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott, a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.
It's known as Stonewall, in 1969, and it's where a group of LGBT patrons fought back against police beatings at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked three days of rioting.
Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks were at the forefront of this rebellion, and it's a really interesting example of the intersection of our struggles against racism, homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.
After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups sprang up all over the country, and the modern gay rights movement as we know it took off.
So the next moment to look at on the timeline is the 1963 March on Washington.
This was a seminal event in the civil rights movement and it's where African-Americans called for both civil and economic justice.
And it's of course where Martin Luther King delivered his famous "I have a dream" speech, but what's actually less known is that this march was organized by a man named Bayard Rustin.
Bayard was an out gay man, and he's considered one of the most brilliant strategists of the civil rights movement.
He later in his life became a fierce advocate of LGBT rights as well, and his life is testament to the intersection of the struggles.
The March on Washington is one of the high points of the movement, and it's where there was a fervent belief that African-Americans too could be a part of American democracy.
I call this strategy the "We are visible and many in numbers" strategy.
Some early gay activists were actually directly inspired by the march, and some had taken part.
Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said, "We marched with Martin Luther King, seven of us from the Mattachine Society" -- which was an early gay rights organization — "and from that moment on, we had our own dream about a gay rights march of similar proportions.
" Several years later, a series of marches took place, each one gaining the momentum of the gay freedom struggle.
The day of that march, October 11, was then declared National Coming Out Day, and is still celebrated all over the world.
These marches set the groundwork for the historic changes that we see happening today in the United States.
And lastly, the "Loving" strategy.
The name speaks for itself.
In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in Loving v. Virginia, and invalidated all laws that prohibited interracial marriage.
This is considered one of the Supreme Court's landmark civil rights cases.
In 1996, President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA, and that made the federal government only have to recognize marriages between a man and a woman.
In United States v. Windsor, a 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor sued the federal government when she was forced to pay estate taxes on her deceased wife's property, something that heterosexual couples don't have to do.
It was incredible.
But the gay marriage movement has been making gains for years now.
To date, 17 states have passed laws allowing marriage equality.
It's become the de facto battle for gay equality, and it seems like daily, laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts, even in places like Texas and Utah, which no one saw coming.
So a lot has changed since that night in 2008 when I felt torn in half.
I did go on to make that film.
It's a documentary film, and it's called "The New Black," and it looks at how the African-American community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the gay marriage movement and this fight over the meaning of civil rights.
And I wanted to capture some of this incredible change that was happening, and as luck or politics would have it, another marriage battle started gearing up, this time in Maryland, where African-Americans make up 30 percent of the electorate.
So this tension between gay rights and civil rights started to bubble up once again, and I was lucky enough to capture how some people were making the connection between the movements this time.
This is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes and Samantha Masters, two characters in the film, as they hit the streets of Baltimore and try to convince potential voters.
(Video) Samantha Masters: That's what's up, man, this is a righteous man over here.
Okay, are you registered to vote?
Man: No. Karess Taylor-Hughes: Okay.
How old are you?
Man: 21. KTH: 21? You gotta get registered to vote. We got to get you registered to vote.
Man: I ain't voting on no gay shit.
SM: Okay, why?
What's up?
Man: I ain't with that.
SM: That's not cool.
Man: What made you be gay?
SM: So what made you be straight?
So what made you be straight?
Man 2: You can't answer that question.
(Laughter) KSM: I used to not have the same rights as you, but I know that because a black man like yourself stood up for a woman like me, I know that I've got the same opportunities.
So you, as a black man, have the opportunity to stand up for somebody else.
They ain't got that power.
Nobody has that power to say, you can't marry that young lady.
Who has that power? Nobody. SM: But you know what?
Our state has put the power in your hands, and so what we need you to do is vote for, you gonna vote for 6. Man 2: I got you.
SM: Vote for 6, okay?
Man 2: I got you.
KSM: All right, do y'all need community service hours? You do?
All right, you can always volunteer with us to get community service hours.
Y'all want to do that?
We feed you.
We bring you pizza.
(Laughter) (Applause) Yoruba Richen: Thank you.
What's amazing to me about that clip that we just captured as we were filming is, it really shows how Karess understands the history of the civil rights movement, but she's not restricted by it.
She doesn't just limit it to black people.
She sees it as a blueprint for expanding rights to gays and lesbians.
Maybe because she's younger, she's like 25, she's able to do this a little bit more easily, but the fact is that Maryland voters did pass that marriage equality amendment, and in fact it was the first time that marriage equality was directly voted on and passed by the voters.
African-Americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded.
It was a complete turnaround from that night in 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed.
It was, and feels, monumental.
We in the LGBT community have gone from being a pathologized and reviled and criminalized group to being seen as part of the great human quest for dignity and equality.
We've gone from having to hide our sexuality in order to maintain our jobs and our families to literally getting a place at the table with the president and a shout out at his second inauguration.
I just want to read what he said at that inauguration: "We the people declare today that the most evident of truths, that all of us are created equal.
It is the star that guides us still, just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.
His statement demonstrates not only the interconnectedness of those movements, but how each one borrowed and was inspired by the other.
Maybe one more other reason for the relative quick progress of the gay rights movement.
Whereas a lot of us continue to still live in racially segregated spaces, LGBT folks, we are everywhere.
We are in urban communities and rural communities, communities of color, immigrant communities, churches and mosques and synagogues.
We are your mothers and brothers and sisters and sons.
And when someone that you love or a family member comes out, it may be easier to support their quest for equality.
And in fact, the gay rights movement asks us to support justice and equality from a space of love.
That may be the biggest, greatest gift that the movement has given us.
It calls on us to access that which is most universal and most intimate: a love of our brother and our sister and our neighbor.
I just want to end with a quote by one of our greatest freedom fighters who's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
Nelson Mandela led South Africa after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid, and out of the ashes of that legalized racial discrimination, he led South Africa to become the first country in the world to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation within its constitution.
Thank you.

In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route.
But this wasn't a stroke of luck.
Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher than anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers.
The Potiidaeans believed they had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon.
But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon that has destroyed countless others: a tsunami.
Although tsunamis are commonly known as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon.
In many ways, tsunamis are just larger versions of regular waves.
They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water.
The difference is in where this energy comes from.
For normal ocean waves, it comes from wind.
Because this only affects the surface, the waves are limited in size and speed.
But tsunamis are caused by energy originating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly, an earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates of the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount of energy into the water.
This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above the normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple outwards horizontally.
Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour.
When it's far from shore, a tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through the entire depth of the water.
But when it reaches shallow water, something called wave shoaling occurs.
Because there is less water to move through, this still massive amount of energy is compressed.
The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises to as much as 100 feet.
The word tsunami, Japanese for "harbor wave," comes from the fact that it only seems to appear near the coast.
If the trough of a tsunami reaches shore first, the water will withdraw farther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous.
A tsunami will not only drown people near the coast, but level buildings and trees for a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas.
As if that weren't enough, the water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone, unfortunate enough to be caught in its path.
The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people throughout South Asia.
So how can we protect ourselves against this destructive force of nature?
People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis with sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water.
But these are not always effective.
In 2011, a tsunami surpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives.
Many scientists and policy makers are instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure and seismic activity, and establishing global communication networks for quickly distributing alerts.

Pick a card, any card.
Actually, just pick up all of them and take a look.
This standard 52-card deck has been used for centuries.
Everyday, thousands just like it are shuffled in casinos all over the world, the order rearranged each time.
And yet, every time you pick up a well-shuffled deck like this one, you are almost certainly holding an arrangement of cards that has never before existed in all of history.
How can this be?
The answer lies in how many different arrangements of 52 cards, or any objects, are possible.
Now, 52 may not seem like such a high number, but let's start with an even smaller one.
Say we have four people trying to sit in four numbered chairs.
How many ways can they be seated?
To start off, any of the four people can sit in the first chair.
One this choice is made, only three people remain standing.
After the second person sits down, only two people are left as candidates for the third chair.
And after the third person has sat down, the last person standing has no choice but to sit in the fourth chair.
If we manually write out all the possible arrangements, or permutations, it turns out that there are 24 ways that four people can be seated into four chairs, but when dealing with larger numbers, this can take quite a while.
We start with the number of objects we're arranging, four in this case, and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers until we reach one.
This is an exciting discovery.
So exciting that mathematicians have chosen to symbolize this kind of calculation, known as a factorial, with an exclamation mark.
As a general rule, the factorial of any positive integer is calculated as the product of that same integer and all smaller integers down to one.
In our simple example, the number of ways four people can be arranged into chairs is written as four factorial, which equals 24. So let's go back to our deck.
Just as there were four factorial ways of arranging four people, there are 52 factorial ways of arranging 52 cards.
Fortunately, we don't have to calculate this by hand.
Just enter the function into a calculator, and it will show you that the number of possible arrangements is 8.07 x 10^67, or roughly eight followed by 67 zeros.
Just how big is this number?
Well, if a new permutation of 52 cards were written out every second starting 13.8 billion years ago, when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred, the writing would still be continuing today and for millions of years to come.
In fact, there are more possible ways to arrange this simple deck of cards than there are atoms on Earth.
So the next time it's your turn to shuffle, take a moment to remember that you're holding something that may have never before existed and may never exist again.Pick a card, any card.

If we manually write out all the possible arrangements, or permutations, it turns out that there are 24 ways that four people can be seated into four chairs, but when dealing with larger numbers, this can take quite a while.
So let's see if there's a quicker way.
Going from the beginning again, you can see that each of the four initial choices for the first chair leads to three more possible choices for the second chair, and each of those choices leads to two more for the third chair.
So instead of counting each final scenario individually, we can multiply the number of choices for each chair: four times three times two times one to achieve the same result of 24. An interesting pattern emerges.
We start with the number of objects we're arranging, four in this case, and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers until we reach one.

" I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud, but that was a greatly defining moment in my life.Animation and art has always been my first love.
It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for "Malicious Dishes.
" There was a virus on my computer, and I was trying to get rid of it, and all of a sudden, I just thought, what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer?
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things?
And thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born.
At four years old, my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again.
That started my love for technology.
I built my first website myself in HTML, and I'm learning JavaScript and Python.
So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team.
(Applause) (Foot stomp) (Music) (Roar) Pollinator: Deforestsaurus!
I should have known!
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!
(Music) Thank you.
(Applause) All of my animations start with ideas, but what are ideas?
Ideas can spark a movement.
Ideas are opportunities and innovation. Ideas truly are what make the world go round.
If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be where we are now with technology, medicine, art, culture, and how we even live our lives.
At eight years old, I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya's Ideas, and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.
(Laughter) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.
I'm 13 now, and although I started my business in 2008, my artistic journey started way before then.
I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did, even my business.
I would find different fabrics around the house, and say, &amp;quot;This could be a scarf or a hat,&amp;quot; and I had all these ideas for designs.
I noticed when I wore my creations, people would stop me and say, "Wow, that's really cute.
Where can I get one?
" And I thought, I can start my own business.
Now I didn't have any business plans at only eight years old.
I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back.
My mom taught me how to sew, and on my back porch, I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon, and I would write down the names and the price of each item.
I started making more items like hats, scarves and bags.
Soon, my items began selling all over the world, and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and more.
Now, I had a lot to learn about my business, like branding and marketing, staying engaged with my customers, and seeing what sold the most and the least.
Soon, my business really started to take off. Then one day, Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old.
(Laughter) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article.
Now a lot of people ask me, why is your business eco-friendly?
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow. We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world, and that makes me even more passionate to save it.
But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world. It takes to get it through your hearts, because when you get it through your heart, that is when movements are sparked.
That is when opportunities and innovation are created, and that is why ideas come to life.
Thank you, and peace and blessings.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) Pat Mitchell: So, you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman.
Where are they?
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah!

Nine years ago, I worked for the U. S. government in Iraq, helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.
And I was there, and I worked in that job because I believe that technology can improve people's lives.
One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad, and he said to me, "You Americans, you can put a man on the moon, but when I get home tonight, I won't be able to turn on my lights.
" At the time, the U. S. government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction.
How do you ensure technology reaches users?
How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful?
So those are the questions that my colleagues and I at D-Rev ask ourselves.
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.
And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users, and not just any users, but customers who live on less than four dollars a day.
One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then, there are some commonalities.
Despite the advanced technology, it's not reaching the people who need it most.
So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on, the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee for above-knee amputees.
And this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization, the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world, came to the Bay Area and they said, "We need a better knee.
" Chances are, if you're living on less than four dollars a day, and you're an amputee, you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.
Most people think it's land mines, but it's a vehicle accident.
You're walking by the side of the road and you're hit by a truck, or you're trying to to jump on a moving train, you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.
And the reality is that if you don't have much money, like this young named Kamal right here, the option you really have is a bamboo staff to get around.
And how big a problem is this?
There's over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee. And what are their options?
This is a high-end.
This is what we'd call a "smart knee.
" It's got a microprocessor inside.
It can pretty much do anything, but it's 20,000 dollars, and to give you a sense of who wears this, veterans, American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq would be fit with something like this.
This is a low-end titanium knee.
It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism, that mimics a natural human knee.
But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive for people like Kamal.
And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.
This is a knee that's been designed specifically for poor people.
And while you have affordability, you've lost on functionality.
The mechanism here is a single axis, and a single axis is like a door hinge.
So at the top you have a socket, and this fits over someone's residual limb, and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.
And then you have the knee, and here I've got a single axis on the knee so you can see how it rotates, and then a pylon, and then a foot.
And we've been able to develop a knee, a polycentric knee, so that type of knee that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait, for 80 dollars retail.
(Applause) But the key is, you can have this great invention, you can have this great design, but how do you get it to the people who most need it?
How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?
So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects, and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers, to users, to people who need it. And the first thing is that the product needs to be world class.
It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market.
Regardless of your income level, you want the most beautiful, the best product that there is. I'm going to show you a video now of a man named Ash.
You can see him walking. He's wearing the same knee system here with a single axis knee.
And he's doing a 10-meter walk test.
And you'll notice that he's struggling with stability as he's walking. And something that's not obvious, that you can't see, is that it's psychologically draining to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.
Now this is a video of Kamal.
You remember Kamal earlier, holding the bamboo staff.
He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee, and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.
And you can see his stability is much better.
So world class isn't just about technical performance.
It's also about human performance.
And most medical devices, we've learned, as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners, for wealthier economies.
But the reality is our users, our customers, they do different things.
They sit cross-legged more.
We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.
And we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market.
So the second thing we learned, and this leads into my second point, which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user-centric.
And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say you need to be user-obsessed.
So it's not just the end user that you're thinking about, but everyone who interacts with the product, so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee, but also the context in which the knee is being fit.
What is the local market like?
How do all these components get to the clinic?
Do they all get there on time?
The supply chain.
Everything that goes into ensuring that this product gets to the end user, and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.
So I wanted to show you some of the iterations we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee, so this is it right here.
(Clicking) Notice anything about it?
It clicks.
We'd seen that users had actually modified it.
So do you see that black strip right there?
That's a homemade noise dampener.
We also saw that our users had modified it in other ways.
You can see there that that particular amputee, he had wrapped bandages around the knee.
He'd made a cosmesis.
And if you look at the knee, it's got those pointy edges, right?
So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari, it's really obvious that you're wearing a prosthetic limb, and in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled, people are particularly acute about this.
So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did. We did a lot of iterations, not just around this, but some other things.
But here we have the version three, the ReMotion Knee, but if you look in here, you can see the noise dampener.
It's quieter.
The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile.
We made it thinner.
And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production.
And this goes into my last point.
We really, truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed, it needs to be market-driven, and market-driven means that products are sold.
They're not donated.
They're not heavily subsidized.
And we believe that as designers, it holds us accountable to our customers. And with centralized manufacturing, you can control the quality control, and you can hit that $80 price point with profit margins built in.
And now, those profit margins are critical, because if you want to scale, if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee, it needs to be economically sustainable.
So I want to give you a sense of where we are at.
We have fit over 5,000 amputees, and one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course, is, does it improve lives?
Well, the standard is, is someone still wearing their knee six months later?
The industry average is about 65 percent.
Ours is 79 percent, and we're hoping to get that higher.
Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.
This is where we want to get, though, in the next three years.
We'll double the impact in 2015, and we'll double it each of the following years after that.
But then we hit a new challenge, and that's the number of skilled prosthetists who are able to fit knees.
So I want to end with a story of Pournima.
And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again, I can go back and complete my studies.
" And to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users.
So thank you.
(Applause)
(Aquatic noises) So this video was taken at Aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of Key Largo, about 60 feet below the surface.
NASA uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts, and last year, they invited us along for the ride.
All the footage was taken from our open ROV, which is a robot that we built in our garage.
So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle, which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether back to the computer topside.
It's open source, meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online, allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design.
It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the ROVs James Cameron used to explore the Titanic.
So ROVs aren't new.
They've been around for decades.
Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.
Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction.
What we've built isn't unique.
So I want to give you a quick story of how it got started.
We learned a lot.
Did you find the gold?
It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, but something that we're all participating in.
It's an underwater world we're all exploring together.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So when I do my job, people hate me.
In fact, the better I do my job, the more people hate me.
And no, I'm not a meter maid, and I'm not an undertaker.
I am a progressive, lesbian talking head on Fox News.
(Applause) So y'all heard that, right?
Just to make sure, right?
I am a gay talking head on Fox News.
I am going to tell you how I do it, and the most important thing I've learned.
So I go on television.
I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in -- in some cases, who don't want me and people like me to even exist.
It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids, with a live television audience of millions.
It's totally almost just like that.
And that's just on air.
The hate mail I get is unbelievable.
Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count.
I was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge, a cunt and an ugly man, and that was just in one email.
(Laughter) So what have I realized, being on the receiving end of all this ugliness?
Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades, we've been focused on political correctness, but what matters more is emotional correctness.
Let me give you a small example.
I don't care if you call me a dyke.
I really don't.
I care about two things.
One, I care that you spell it right.
(Laughter) (Applause) Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.
You'd totally be surprised.
Are you just being naive?
Or do you really want to hurt me personally?
And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.
So when I first went to go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging.
Now here's the kicker.
I mean, not all of them, and not the ones who send me hate mail, but you would be surprised.
Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions, I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter, and they're just looking for someone to blame.
And one of my all-time favorites begins: "I am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic, (Laughter) but I'm a big fan of you as a person.
" Now this guy doesn't agree with me -- yet.
(Laughter) But he's listening -- not because of what I said, but because of how I said it. And somehow, even though we've never met, we've managed to form a connection.
That's emotional correctness, and that's how we start the conversations that really lead to change.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game: massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling. It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you, the player, the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.
We can really go for it.So you can see up here. Now the only other rule you need to remember is, gamer generation, we like a challenge. I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using. So I think we should kind of get some more involved.
Now — (Laughter) — before we get started -- This is great.You're excited to play.
— before we get started, can I have the slides back up here really quick, because if you get good at this game, I want you to know there are some advanced levels. So this is the kind of simple level, right?
But there are advanced configurations. This is called the Death Star Configuration.
Any Star Wars fans?
Into the network.Make the node.Stand up!
It's easier if you stand up. Everybody, up up up up up!
Stand up, my friends. All right.
Don't start wrestling yet.
If you have a free thumb, wave it around, make sure it gets connected. Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check. If you have a free thumb, wave it around to make sure. Grab that thumb!
Reach behind you. There you go. Any other thumbs?
Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go. Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it. Okay?
One, two, three, go!
(Laughter) Did you win?
You got it? You got it?
Excellent!(Applause) Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right.
While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game, let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions. So curiosity. I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling. " You were like, "What the hell is she talking about?
" So I provoked a little curiosity. Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node. I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up. So you used creativity.
You can teach other people.So congratulations.How many of you won just won thumb?
So congratulations, grandmasters. Win one thumb once, you will become a grandmaster.
Hetain Patel: (In Chinese) Yuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain.
I'm an artist.
And this is Yuyu, who is a dancer I have been working with.
I have asked her to translate for me.
HP: (In Chinese) YR: If I may, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and my artwork.
HP: (In Chinese) YR: I was born and raised near Manchester, in England, but I'm not going to say it in English to you, because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent.
(Laughter) HP: (In Chinese) YR: The only problem with masking it with Chinese Mandarin is I can only speak this paragraph, which I have learned by heart when I was visiting in China.
(Laughter) So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won't notice.
(Laughter) HP: (In Chinese) (Laughter) YR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize to any Mandarin speakers in the audience.
As a child, I would hate being made to wear the Indian kurta pajama, because I didn't think it was very cool.
It felt a bit girly to me, like a dress, and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.
My dad never wore it, so I didn't see why I had to.
Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable, that people assume I represent something genuinely Indian when I wear it, because that's not how I feel.
HP: (In Chinese) YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics, watch kung fu movies, take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.
Now you put water into a cup.
It becomes the cup.
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
Now, water can flow or it can crash.
Be water, my friend.
(Applause) YR: This year, I am 32 years old, the same age Bruce Lee was when he died.
I have been wondering recently, if he were alive today, what advice he would give me about making this TED Talk.
HP: Don't imitate my voice.
It offends me.
(Laughter) YR: Good advice, but I still think that we learn who we are by copying others.
Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero in the playground, or mum or father?
I have.
HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair so that I could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from India to the U. K. in the 1960s.
He had a side parting and a neat mustache.
At first, it was going very well.
I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.
(Laughter) But then very quickly, I started to underestimate my mustache growing ability, and it got way too big.
It didn't look Indian anymore.
Instead, people from across the road, they would shout things like -- HP and YR: Arriba!
Arriba!
Ándale! Ándale!
(Laughter) HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this.
My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore.
He talks like this now.
So it's not just my father that I've imitated.
A few years ago I went to China for a few months, and I couldn't speak Chinese, and this frustrated me, so I wrote about this and had it translated into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart, like music, I guess.
YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card, so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently.
When I had learned this phrase, I had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded.
I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed and told me, "Oh yeah, that's great, only it kind of sounds like a woman.
" I said, "What?
" He said, "Yeah, you learned from a woman?
" I said, "Yes. So?
" He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well, but in a woman's voice.
(Laughter) (Applause) HP: Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk.
It doesn't always go as you plan it, even with a talented translator.
But I am going to stick with it, because contrary to what we might usually assume, imitating somebody can reveal something unique.
So every time I fail to become more like my father, I become more like myself.
Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee, I become more authentically me.
This is my art.
I strive for authenticity, even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect.
It's only recently that I've started to understand that I didn't learn to sit like this through being Indian. I learned this from Spider-Man.
(Laughter) Thank you. (Applause)Hetain Patel: (In Chinese) Yuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain.
I'm an artist.
And this is Yuyu, who is a dancer I have been working with.
I have asked her to translate for me.

My dad never wore it, so I didn't see why I had to.
Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable, that people assume I represent something genuinely Indian when I wear it, because that's not how I feel.
HP: (In Chinese) YR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like Li Mu Bai from that film, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. " (Music) Okay.
So my artwork is about identity and language, challenging common assumptions based on how we look like or where we come from, gender, race, class.
What makes us who we are anyway?
HP: (In Chinese) YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics, watch kung fu movies, take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.
He would say things like -- HP: Empty your mind.
(Laughter) Be formless, shapeless, like water.
Now you put water into a cup.
It becomes the cup.
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
Now, water can flow or it can crash.
Be water, my friend.
(Applause) YR: This year, I am 32 years old, the same age Bruce Lee was when he died.

Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee, I become more authentically me.
This is my art.
So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book, and it's a story of something that happened 3,000 years ago, when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel.
And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn't understand it at all.
Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border, there's a mountain range.
Still same is true of Israel today.
And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.
And then there's a coastal plain along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.
And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah, which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west, and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains.
And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.
It's gorgeous, with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards.
But more importantly, though, in the history of that region, it's served, it's had a real strategic function, and that is, it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way, get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.
And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.
The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies of the Kingdom of Israel, are living in the coastal plain.
They're originally from Crete.
They're a seafaring people.
And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains, because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.
And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul, obviously catches wind of this, and Saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah, one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.
And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge, and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge, and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.
Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other side you've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.
So finally, to break the deadlock, the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor, and he calls out and he says to the Israelites, "Send your mightiest warrior down, and we'll have this out, just the two of us.
" This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.
It was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.
And the Philistine who is sent down, their mighty warrior, is a giant.
He's 6 foot 9. He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor, and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin and he's got his spear.
He is absolutely terrifying.
And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.
It's a death wish, right?
There's no way they think they can take him.
And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy, and he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him.
" And Saul says, "You can't fight him.
That's ridiculous.
You're this kid.
This is this mighty warrior.
" But the shepherd is adamant.
He says, "No, no, no, you don't understand, I have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it.
" And Saul has no choice.
He's got no one else who's come forward.
So he says, "All right.
" And then he turns to the kid, and he says, "But you've got to wear this armor.
You can't go as you are.
" So he tries to give the shepherd his armor, and the shepherd says, "No.
" He says, "I can't wear this stuff.
" The Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it," meaning, "I've never worn armor before.
You've got to be crazy.
" He issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him.
And the shepherd draws closer and closer, and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.
That's all he's carrying.
Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff, and he says -- he's insulted -- "Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?
And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David, and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story turned out to be wrong.
So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?
In fact, that term, David and Goliath, has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger.
Now why do we call David an underdog?
Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid, a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.
We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior, and David is just a shepherd.
But most importantly, we call him an underdog because all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry, this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear, and all David has is this sling.
Well, let's start there with the phrase "All David has is this sling," because that's the first mistake that we make.
In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.
There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.
There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers, armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor.
And there's artillery, and artillery are archers, but, more importantly, slingers.
That's what David has, and it's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot.
It's not this, right?
It's not a child's toy.
It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.
When David rolls it around like this, he's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second, and that means that when the rock is released, it's going forward really fast, probably 35 meters per second.
That's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.
More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks.
They were barium sulphate, which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.
If you do the calculations on the ballistics, on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling, it's roughly equal to the stopping power of a [. 45 caliber] handgun.
This is an incredibly devastating weapon.
Accuracy, we know from historical records that slingers -- experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.
From medieval tapestries, we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight.
They were incredibly accurate.
When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath, he's quite close to Goliath -- when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath, he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes.
If you go back over the history of ancient warfare, you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another.
So what's Goliath?
He's heavy infantry, and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.
When he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field," the key phrase is "Come to me.
" Come up to me because we're going to fight, hand to hand, like this.
Saul has the same expectation.
David says, "I want to fight Goliath," and Saul tries to give him his armor, because Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,' you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,' infantry on infantry.
" But David has absolutely no expectation.
He's not going to fight him that way.
Why would he?
He's a shepherd.
He's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.
That's where his strength lies.
So here he is, this shepherd, experienced in the use of a devastating weapon, up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short-range combat.
Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.
So why do we keep calling David an underdog, and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?
There's a second piece of this that's important.
It's not just that we misunderstand David and his choice of weaponry.
It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.
Goliath is not what he seems to be.
There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text, things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.
So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant.
Now that is weird, right?
Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.
Why is he being led by the hand by some young boy, presumably, to the point of combat?
Secondly, the Bible story makes special note of how slowly Goliath moves, another odd thing to say when you're describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point.
And then there's this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David.
So David's coming down the mountain, and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.
There is nothing about him that says, "I am about to fight you like this.
" He's not even carrying a sword.
And then there's that strange comment he makes to David: "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?
" Sticks?
David only has one stick. Well, it turns out that there's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with Goliath, an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.
There have been many articles written.
So the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly, and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.
And throughout history, many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly.
So the tallest person of all time was a guy named Robert Wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of 24 and he was 8 foot 11. He had acromegaly.
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant? Famous. He had acromegaly.
There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.
Anyone who's unusually tall, that's the first explanation we come up with.
And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it, principally having to do with vision.
The pituitary tumor, as it grows, often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain, with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.
So when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with Goliath, they've said, "Wait a minute, he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly.
" And that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day.
Why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant?
Because he can't make his way on his own.
Why is he so strangely oblivious to David that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him until the very last moment?
Because he can't see him.
When he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field," the phrase "come to me" is a hint also of his vulnerability.
Come to me because I can't see you.
And then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?
" He sees two sticks when David has only one.
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe.
What they didn't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness.
And there is, I think, in that, a very important lesson for all of us.
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.
Thank you.
(Applause)So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book, and it's a story of something that happened 3,000 years ago, when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel.
And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn't understand it at all.
Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border, there's a mountain range.
And then there's a coastal plain along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.
And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah, which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west, and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains.
And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.
It's gorgeous, with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards.
But more importantly, though, in the history of that region, it's served, it's had a real strategic function, and that is, it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way, get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.
And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.
The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies of the Kingdom of Israel, are living in the coastal plain.
They're originally from Crete.
They're a seafaring people.
And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains, because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.
And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul, obviously catches wind of this, and Saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah, one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.
And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge, and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge, and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.
Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other side you've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.
So finally, to break the deadlock, the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor, and he calls out and he says to the Israelites, "Send your mightiest warrior down, and we'll have this out, just the two of us.
" This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.
It was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.
And the Philistine who is sent down, their mighty warrior, is a giant.
He's 6 foot 9. He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor, and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin and he's got his spear.
He is absolutely terrifying.
And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.
It's a death wish, right?
There's no way they think they can take him.
And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy, and he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him.
" And Saul says, "You can't fight him.
That's ridiculous.
You're this kid.
This is this mighty warrior.
" But the shepherd is adamant.
He says, "No, no, no, you don't understand, I have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it.
" And Saul has no choice.
He's got no one else who's come forward.
So he says, "All right.
" And then he turns to the kid, and he says, "But you've got to wear this armor.
You can't go as you are.
" So he tries to give the shepherd his armor, and the shepherd says, "No.
" He says, "I can't wear this stuff.
" The Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it," meaning, "I've never worn armor before.
You've got to be crazy.
" So he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd's bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.
And the shepherd draws closer and closer, and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.
That's all he's carrying.
Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff, and he says -- he's insulted -- "Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?
And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David, and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story turned out to be wrong.
So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?
In fact, that term, David and Goliath, has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger.
Now why do we call David an underdog?
Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid, a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.
We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior, and David is just a shepherd.
But most importantly, we call him an underdog because all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry, this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear, and all David has is this sling.
Well, let's start there with the phrase "All David has is this sling," because that's the first mistake that we make.
In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.
There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.
There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers, armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor.
And there's artillery, and artillery are archers, but, more importantly, slingers.
That's what David has, and it's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot.
It's not this, right?
It's not a child's toy.
It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.
That's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.
More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks.
They were barium sulphate, which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.
If you do the calculations on the ballistics, on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling, it's roughly equal to the stopping power of a [. 45 caliber] handgun.
When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath, he's quite close to Goliath -- when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath, he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes.
He's heavy infantry, and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.
" Come up to me because we're going to fight, hand to hand, like this.
And throughout history, many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly.
So the tallest person of all time was a guy named Robert Wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of 24 and he was 8 foot 11. He had acromegaly.
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant? Famous. He had acromegaly.
And then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?
" He sees two sticks when David has only one.
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe.
What they didn't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness.
And there is, I think, in that, a very important lesson for all of us.
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Do you think it's possible to control someone's attention?
Even more than that, what about predicting human behavior?
I think those are interesting ideas.
For me, that would be the perfect superpower, actually kind of an evil way of approaching it.
But for myself, in the past, I've spent the last 20 years studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way: picking pockets.
When we think of misdirection, we think of something as looking off to the side, when actually the things right in front of us are often the hardest to see, the things that you look at every day that you're blinded to.
For example, how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now? Great. Double-check. Make sure you still have them.
I was doing some shopping before.
(Laughter) You've looked at them a few times today, but I'll ask you a question.
Without looking at it directly yet, can you remember the icon in the bottom right corner?
Bring them out, check and see how accurate you were.
How'd you do?
Show of hands.
Did we get it?
Now that you're done, close them down.
Every phone has something in common.
No matter how you organize the icons, you still have a clock on the front.
So, without looking at your phone, what time was it?
You just looked at your clock, right?
Interesting idea.
Let's take that a step further with a game of trust.
Close your eyes.
I realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard there's a pickpocket in the room, but close your eyes.
Now, you've been watching me for about 30 seconds.
With your eyes closed, what am I wearing?
Make your best guess. What color is my shirt?
What color is my tie?
Now open your eyes.
Show of hands, were you right?
Interesting, isn't it?
Some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others, it seems.
But I have a different theory about that model of attention.
They have fancy models of attention, Posner's trinity model of attention.
For me, I like to think of it very simple, like a surveillance system.
It's kind of like you have all these fancy sensors, and inside your brain is a little security guard.
For me, I like to call him Frank.
So Frank is sitting at a desk.
He's got lots of cool information in front of him, high-tech equipment, he's got cameras, he's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears, all these senses, all these perceptions.
But attention is what steers your perceptions, it's what controls your reality.
It's the gateway to the mind.
If you don't attend to something, you can't be aware of it.
But ironically, you can attend to something without being aware of it.
For example, the cocktail effect: You're in a party, having conversations with someone, and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that.
Now, for my job, I have to play with techniques to exploit this, to play with your attention as a limited resource.
So if I could control how you spend your attention, if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction.
So if I ask you to access a memory, like, what is that?
What just happened?
Do you have a wallet?
Do you have an American Express in your wallet?
And when I do that, your Frank turns around.
He accesses the file.
He has to rewind the tape.
If I come down, I'm going to do a bit of shopping.
Just hold still where you are.
Hello, how are you?
It's lovely to see you.
Wonderful job onstage.
Lovely watch, it doesn't come off very well.
Do you have a ring as well? Good. Just taking inventory.
You're like a buffet.
Hard to tell where to start, so many great things.
Hi, how are you?
Good to see you.
Hi, sir, could you stand up, please?
Just right where you are.
You're married, you follow directions well. Nice to meet you, sir.
You don't have a lot in your pockets.
Anything down here?
Hopefully so.
Have a seat.
There you go.You're doing well.
Hi, sir, how are you?
Good to see you, sir.
You have a ring, a watch.
Do you have a wallet on you?
Joe: I don't.
AR: Well, we'll find one for you.
Come on up this way, Joe.
Give Joe a round of applause.
Come on up, Joe.
Let's play a game.
(Applause) AR: Pardon me.
I don't think I need this clicker anymore.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Come on up to the stage, Joe.
Let's play a little game now.
Anything in your front pockets?
J: Money.
AR: Money!
All right, let's try that.
Can you stand right over this way for me?
Turn around and, let's see, if I give you something that belongs to me, this is just something I have, a poker chip.
Hold out your hand for me.
Watch it closely.
This is a task for you to focus on. You have your money in your front pocket?
J: Yup.
AR: Good.
I won't put my hand in your pocket.
I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.
Once a guy had a hole in his pocket, and that was rather traumatizing for me.
I wanted his wallet, he gave me his number.
Big miscommunication.
(Laughter) Let's do this simply.
Squeeze your hand tight.
Do you feel the poker chip in your hand?
J: I do.
AR: Would you be surprised if I took it?
Say yes.
J: Very.
AR: Good.
Open your hand.
Thank you very much.
I'll cheat if you give me a chance.
Make it harder for me.
Just use your hand.
Grab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.
Did you see it go?
Joe: No.
AR: No, it's not here.
Open your hand.
While we're focused on the hand, it's sitting on your shoulder.
Go ahead and take it off.
Now, let's try that again.
Hold your hand out flat.
Open it up.
Put your hand up a little bit higher, but watch it close.
If I did it slowly, it'd be on your shoulder.
(Laughter) Joe, we're going to keep doing this till you catch it.
You'll get it eventually.
I have faith in you.
You were focused on your hand, distracted.
Do you remember what it was?
J: Money.
AR: Check your pocket.
Put it away.
We're just shopping.
This trick's more about the timing.
I'm going to try to push it inside your hand.
Put your other hand on top, would you?
It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?
Looks a lot like the watch I was wearing, doesn't it?
(Laughter) (Applause) J: That's pretty good.
(Applause) But it's only a start.
Let's try it a little bit differently.
Your other hand on top.
If you're watching this little token, this obviously has become a little target, like a red herring.
If we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away.
We've got a little guy.
He's union, works up there all day.
If I do it slowly it goes straight away, it lands by your pocket.
Don't reach in your pocket.
That's a different show.
(Squeaking) That's rather strange.
They have shots for that.
Can I show them?
Rather bizarre.
I have no idea how that works.
We'll send that over there.
I need help with this one.
I was checking mine.
I couldn't find everything, but I noticed you had something here.
Can I feel the outside for a moment?
Down here I noticed this.
Is this something of yours, sir?
I have no idea.
I'm saving it for later.
AR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way, better than you know.
(Applause) Joe, thank you very much.
Bring them out, check and see how accurate you were.
Did we get it?
Let's take that a step further with a game of trust.
Some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others, it seems.

Squeeze firm.
You're human, you're not slow.
It's back on your shoulder.
You were focused on your hand, distracted.
While you were watching, I couldn't get your watch off.
Yet you had something inside your pocket.
Do you remember what it was?
J: Money.
AR: Check your pocket.
Is it still there?
(Laughter) Oh, there it was.
Put it away.
We're just shopping.
This trick's more about the timing.
I'm going to try to push it inside your hand.
Put your other hand on top, would you?
It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?
Looks a lot like the watch I was wearing, doesn't it?
(Laughter) (Applause) J: That's pretty good.
AR: Oh, thanks.
(Applause) But it's only a start.
Let's try it a little bit differently.
Hold your hands together.
Your other hand on top.
If you're watching this little token, this obviously has become a little target, like a red herring.
If we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away.
It's not back on your shoulder.
It falls out of the air, lands right back in the hand.
Did you see it go? Yeah, funny.
We've got a little guy.
He's union, works up there all day.
If I do it slowly it goes straight away, it lands by your pocket.
Is it in this pocket, sir?
Don't reach in your pocket.
That's a different show.
(Squeaking) That's rather strange.
They have shots for that.
Can I show them?
Rather bizarre.
Is this yours, sir?
I have no idea how that works.
We'll send that over there.
I need help with this one.
Step over this way for me.
Don't run away.
You had something down by your pants pocket.
I was checking mine.
I couldn't find everything, but I noticed you had something here.
Can I feel the outside for a moment?
Down here I noticed this.
Is this something of yours, sir?
I have no idea.
That's a shrimp.
J: Yeah.
I'm saving it for later.
AR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way, better than you know.
So we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift.
(Laughter) Hopefully it matches his taste. We have a couple of other things, a little bit of cash.
And we have a few other things, these all belong to you, along with a big round of applause from all your friends.
(Applause) Joe, thank you very much.
(Applause) (Applause ends) So, same question I asked you before, but this time you don't have to close your eyes.
What am I wearing?
Audience: Oh!
(Laughter) (Hesitant applause) (Applause ends) Attention is a powerful thing.
Like I said, it shapes your reality.
So, I guess I'd like to pose that question to you.
If you could control somebody's attention, what would you do with it?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Anyone?
How about a moderate amount of stress?
Who has experienced a lot of stress? Yeah. Me too.
But that is not my confession.
My confession is this: I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier.
But I fear that something I've been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress.
For years I've been telling people, stress makes you sick.
It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease.
Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy. But I have changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours.
Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, "How much stress have you experienced in the last year?
" They also asked, "Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?
" And then they used public death records to find out who died.
(Laughter) Okay. Some bad news first. People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.
But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health.
(Laughter) People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress.
Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that stress is bad for you. (Laughter) That is over 20,000 deaths a year.
Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide. (Laughter) You can see why this study freaked me out.
Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health.
So this study got me wondering: Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier?
And here the science says yes.
When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body's response to stress. Now to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out.
It's called the social stress test.
(Laughter) And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback, like this.
(Exhales) (Laughter) Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two: a math test.
And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it.
Now we're going to all do this together. It's going to be fun.
For me. Okay. (Laughter) I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven. You're going to do this out loud, as fast as you can, starting with 996. Go! (Audience counting) Go faster. Faster please.
You're going too slow.(Audience counting) Stop.Stop, stop, stop. That guy made a mistake. We are going to have to start all over again. (Laughter) You're not very good at this, are you?
Okay, so you get the idea.
If you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out.
Your heart might be pounding, you might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat.
And normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure.
But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge?
Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University.
Before they went through the social stress test, they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.
That pounding heart is preparing you for action. If you're breathing faster, it's no problem. It's getting more oxygen to your brain.
And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance, well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident, but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed.
Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up, and your blood vessels constrict like this.
And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease.
It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.
But in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this.
Their heart was still pounding, but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile.
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to get rid of your stress. I want to make you better at stress. And we just did a little intervention.
And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress response becomes healthier.
Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from, so we are going to do one more intervention.
I want to tell you about one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the stress response, and the idea is this: Stress makes you social.
To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin, and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone.
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in.
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.
It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships. Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family. It enhances your empathy.
It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about.
Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin. . . to become more compassionate and caring. But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response.
It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound.
And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support.
Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel, instead of bottling it up.
Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other.
When life is difficult, your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you. Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier? Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.
It also acts on your body, and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress. It's a natural anti-inflammatory.
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress. But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart. Your heart has receptors for this hormone, and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage. This stress hormone strengthens your heart.
And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support.
So when you reach out to others under stress, either to seek support or to help someone else, you release more of this hormone, your stress response becomes healthier, and you actually recover faster from stress.
I find this amazing, that your stress response has a built-in mechanism for stress resilience, and that mechanism is human connection.
I want to finish by telling you about one more study. And listen up, because this study could also save a life.
This study tracked about 1,000 adults in the United States, and they ranged in age from 34 to 93, and they started the study by asking, "How much stress have you experienced in the last year?
" And then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died.
And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable.
When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage.
Stress gives us access to our hearts.
The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others, and yes, your pounding physical heart, working so hard to give you strength and energy.
And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us. It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy.
Anyone?
My confession is this: I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier.
It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease.
And here the science says yes.
(Exhales) (Laughter) Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two: a math test.
For me. Okay. (Laughter) I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven. You're going to do this out loud, as fast as you can, starting with 996. Go! (Audience counting) Go faster. Faster please.
But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge?
Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University.
Before they went through the social stress test, they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in.
And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support.
You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges.
Over 60,000 people came to the start line, all wearing white T-shirts with no political slogans. That was a turning point for the marathon, where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity.
Motor racing is a funny old business. We make a new car every year, and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we've built to make it better, to make it faster. And then the next year, we start again.
So sustainability is quite important for us, which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values.
So we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone, or a skeleton, which occurs in nature. So that's why it looks maybe a little bit weird, especially to the people who deal with structures in general.
But at least it's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future. What are the main customers of the future?
So, we have the old, we have the young, we have the uprising power of women, and there's one mega-trend which affects all of us.
These are the future anthropometrics.So our children are getting larger, but at the same time we are growing into different directions. So what we need is space inside the aircraft, inside a very dense area.
These people have different needs.
So for instance, we are asking ourselves, how can we create more light?How can we bring more natural light into the airplane?
So this airplane has no windows anymore, for example. What about the data and communication software which we need in the future?
So as Jason Silva said, if we can imagine it, why not make it so?See you in the future. Thank you. (Applause)What do we know about the future?
Difficult question, simple answer: nothing.
We cannot predict the future.
It takes only one and a half days to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
Today, we know that this future vision didn't come true.
So this is our largest airplane which we have, the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge, so a lot of people fit in there and it's technically completely different than the vision I've shown to you.
I'm working in a team with Airbus, and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of aviation.
So sustainability is quite important for us, which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values.
So we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone, or a skeleton, which occurs in nature. So that's why it looks maybe a little bit weird, especially to the people who deal with structures in general.

I'm five years old, and I am very proud.
My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine.
Inside, it's a smelly, gaping hole in the ground, but outside, it's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun.
This makes me feel so proud, so important, that I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and I devise missions for us.
So we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free.
Four years earlier, when I was one, after the Chernobyl accident, the rain came down black, and my sister's hair fell out in clumps, and I spent nine months in the hospital.
There were no visitors allowed, so my mother bribed a hospital worker.
She acquired a nurse's uniform, and she snuck in every night to sit by my side.
Five years later, an unexpected silver lining.
So the first day we get to New York, my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in.
Only, we don't know that it's a homeless shelter. We think that it's a hotel, a hotel with lots of rats.
And in that moment, I feel like a millionaire.
About a year later, I get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash, and suddenly I have more toys than I've ever had in my whole life.
And again, I get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn, and my sister and I find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn't order.
So we take the pizza, our very first pizza, and we devour slice after slice as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway.
And he tells us to pay, but we don't speak English.
My mother comes out, and he asks her for money, but she doesn't have enough.
She walks 50 blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare.
Then our neighbor pops her head in, and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza.
Everyone's upset.
But the pizza is delicious.
It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had.
On our 10 year anniversary of being in the U. S. , we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U.
S. The man at the front desk laughs, and he says, "You can't reserve a room here.
This is a homeless shelter.
" And we were shocked.
My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid.
His family lost everything, and at age 11, he had to live in motels with his dad, motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill.
And one time, when he finally got his box of Frosted Flakes back, it was crawling with roaches.
But he did have one thing.
He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books, two G. I. Joes painted to look like Spider-Man and five Gobots.
And this was his treasure.
This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams.
I'm going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family.
This is Scarlett.
Once upon a time, Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights.
Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett, and she rolls through the grass, and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude.
We forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations and disappointments, and we feel like millionaires. Thank you. (Applause)I'm five years old, and I am very proud.
My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine.

Well, it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple, logical reason, namely, it's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we're conscious.
You care about science, philosophy, music, art, whatever -- it's no good if you're a zombie or in a coma, right?
And then, even when they're not saying appalling things and they're really trying to do serious research, well, it's been slow.
I think now you might actually get tenure by working on consciousness. If so, that's a real step forward.
Well, I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions.
That's the tradition of God, the soul and immortality.
Either it doesn't exist at all, or it's something else, a computer program or some damn fool thing, but in any case it's not part of science.
And I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache.
Here's how it went.
One: Consciousness does not exist.
It's an illusion, like sunsets.
So consciousness is an illusion.
It's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was, but I'll get back to that. And four: Maybe consciousness exists, but it can't make any difference to the world.
How could spirituality move anything?
Now, whenever somebody tells me that, I think, you want to see spirituality move something? Watch. I decide consciously to raise my arm, and the damn thing goes up.
" No.
It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep, and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious.
" And this, if you've ever had a philosophy course, this is known as the famous mind-body problem.
I think that has a simple solution too.
I'm going to give it to you.
And here it is: All of our conscious states, without exception, are caused by lower-level neurobiological processes in the brain, and they are realized in the brain as higher-level or system features.
It's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water.
Right?
The liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out by the H2O molecules.
It's a condition that the system is in.
And just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules, so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious, depending on the behavior of the molecules.
The famous mind-body problem is that simple.
All right?
But now we get into some harder questions.
Let's specify the exact features of consciousness, so that we can then answer those four objections that I made to it. Well, the first feature is, it's real and irreducible. You can't get rid of it.
You see, the distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are.
It consciously seems like there's -- I like the French "arc-en-ciel" — it seems like there's an arch in the sky, or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains.
It consciously seems to us, but that's not really happening.
But for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are, you can't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness, because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned, if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious, you are conscious.
I mean, if a bunch of experts come to me and say, "We are heavy-duty neurobiologists and we've done a study of you, Searle, and we're convinced you are not conscious, you are a very cleverly constructed robot," I don't think, "Well, maybe these guys are right, you know?
" I don't think that for a moment, because, I mean, Descartes may have made a lot of mistakes, but he was right about this.
You cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness.
Okay, that's the first feature of consciousness.
It's real and irreducible. You cannot get rid of it by showing that it's an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions.
Okay, the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us, and that is, all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them.
Maybe we'll be able to build a conscious machine.
Since we don't know how our brains do it, we're not in a position, so far, to build a conscious machine. Okay. Another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields.
So I don't just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor, but they occur to me as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward.
That is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness.
And we have not been able to do that in a robot.
The disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don't know how to make a conscious robot, so we don't have a machine that can do this kind of thing.
Okay, the next feature of consciousness, after this marvelous unified conscious field, is that it functions causally in our behavior.
I gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand, but how is that possible?
How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects?
Well, I'll tell you the answer.
I mean, we don't know the detailed answer, but we know the basic part of the answer, and that is, there is a sequence of neuron firings, and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons.
Sorry to use philosophical terminology here, but when it's secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons, a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up.
Now, think of what I told you.
One and the same event, my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these touchy-feely spiritual qualities.
Yeah, forget about the hardware.
Is that absolute, like force and mass and gravitational attraction?
Well, some computations are intrinsic.
I add two plus two to get four.
I mean, you have patients that actually suffer pains, and you try to get an objective science of that.
Okay, I promised to refute all these guys, and I don't have an awful lot of time left, but let me refute a couple more of them.
I said that behaviorism ought to be one of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture, because it's refuted the moment you think about it. Your mental states are identical with your behavior?
Well, think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior. I won't demonstrate pain behavior, but I can tell you I'm not having any pains right now.
So it's an obvious mistake.
Why did they make the mistake?
The mistake was — and you can go back and read the literature on this, you can see this over and over — they think if you accept the irreducible existence of consciousness, you're giving up on science.
You're giving up on 300 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it.
And the message I want to leave you with is, consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon, as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology, or, for that matter, the rest of science.
Thank you very much. (Applause)I'm going to talk about consciousness. Why consciousness?
Well, it's a curiously neglected subject, both in our scientific and our philosophical culture. Now why is that curious?
Well, it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple, logical reason, namely, it's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we're conscious.
You care about science, philosophy, music, art, whatever -- it's no good if you're a zombie or in a coma, right?
So consciousness is number one.
The second reason is that when people do get interested in it, as I think they should, they tend to say the most appalling things.
And then, even when they're not saying appalling things and they're really trying to do serious research, well, it's been slow.
Progress has been slow.
But the thing that struck me is, one guy said in exasperation, a very famous neurobiologist, he said, "Look, in my discipline it's okay to be interested in consciousness, but get tenure first.
Get tenure first.
" Now I've been working on this for a long time.
I think now you might actually get tenure by working on consciousness. If so, that's a real step forward.
Okay, now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness?
Well, I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions.
One feature is the tradition of religious dualism: Consciousness is not a part of the physical world.
It's a part of the spiritual world.
It belongs to the soul, and the soul is not a part of the physical world.
That's the tradition of God, the soul and immortality.
There's another tradition that thinks it's opposed to this but accepts the worst assumption.
That tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty scientific materialists: Consciousness is not a part of the physical world.
Either it doesn't exist at all, or it's something else, a computer program or some damn fool thing, but in any case it's not part of science.
And I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache.
Here's how it went.
Science is objective, consciousness is subjective, therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness.
Okay, so these twin traditions are paralyzing us.
It's very hard to get out of these twin traditions.
And I have only one real message in this lecture, and that is, consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis, digestion, mitosis -- you know all the biological phenomena -- and once you accept that, most, though not all, of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate.
And I'm going to go through some of them.
Okay, now I promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness.
Science has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions.
So consciousness is an illusion.
It's a computer program running in the brain.
It's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was, but I'll get back to that. And four: Maybe consciousness exists, but it can't make any difference to the world.
How could spirituality move anything?
(Laughter) Furthermore, notice this: We do not say, "Well, it's a bit like the weather in Geneva.
Some days it goes up and some days it doesn't go up.
It goes up whenever I damn well want it to. Okay. I'm going to tell you how that's possible.
Now, I haven't yet given you a definition.
You can't do this if you don't give a definition.
People always say consciousness is very hard to define.
I think it's rather easy to define if you're not trying to give a scientific definition.
We're not ready for a scientific definition, but here's a common-sense definition.
Consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness.
Now, that's the common-sense definition.
That's our target.
If you're not talking about that, you're not talking about consciousness. But they think, "Well, if that's it, that's an awful problem.
How can such a thing exist as part of the real world?
" And this, if you've ever had a philosophy course, this is known as the famous mind-body problem.
I think that has a simple solution too.
I'm going to give it to you.
And here it is: All of our conscious states, without exception, are caused by lower-level neurobiological processes in the brain, and they are realized in the brain as higher-level or system features.
It's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water.

Sorry to use philosophical terminology here, but when it's secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons, a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up.
Now, think of what I told you.
It's a thought in my brain, but at the same time, it's busy secreting acetylcholine and doing all sorts of other things as it makes its way from the motor cortex down through the nerve fibers in the arm.
Now, what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete.
One and the same event has a level of description where it's neurobiological, and another level of description where it's mental, and that's a single event, and that's how nature works.
But the second one had an incredible influence, and may still be around, and that is, "Well, if consciousness exists, it's really something else.
Any hardware will do provided it's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program.
You get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code, and that's the defining trait of the computer program.
That's going on no matter what anybody thinks.
That's the only absolute phenomenon.
So it's an obvious mistake.
Why did they make the mistake?
The mistake was — and you can go back and read the literature on this, you can see this over and over — they think if you accept the irreducible existence of consciousness, you're giving up on science.
You're giving up on 300 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it.
And the message I want to leave you with is, consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon, as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology, or, for that matter, the rest of science.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
When we talk about corruption, there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind.
There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs. Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them. Until his death in 2006, he was the all-powerful leader of Turkmenistan, a Central Asian country rich in natural gas.
Now, he really loved to issue presidential decrees.
He was a slightly unusual guy.
And then there's that cliché, the African dictator or minister or official.
There's Teodorín Obiang.
So his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record.
The vast majority of its people are living in really miserable poverty despite an income per capita that's on a par with that of Portugal. So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself a $30 million mansion in Malibu, California.
I've been up to its front gates.
And there's Dan Etete. Well, he was the former oil minister of Nigeria under President Abacha, and it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too.
We've spent a great deal of time investigating a $1 billion -- that's right, a $1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with, and what we found was pretty shocking, but more about that later.
So it's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there, carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we, personally, may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on.
But does it just happen over there?
Well, at 22, I was very lucky.
My first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory.
And that's how my relationship with corruption really began.
In 1993, with two friends who were colleagues, Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley, we set up an organization called Global Witness.
Our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia.
So a few years later, and it's now 1997, and I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds.
Perhaps you saw the film, the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond," the one with Leonardo DiCaprio. Well, some of that sprang from our work.
Luanda, it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets, and a tiny, very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal.
And it was a slightly crazy place.
So I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed.
But it wasn't about blood diamonds.
Because I'd been speaking to lots of people there who, well, they talked about a different problem: that of a massive web of corruption on a global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing.
And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people, trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge.
So let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier.
Now, they're all people we've investigated, and they're all people who couldn't do what they do alone.
Take Obiang junior.
Well, he didn't end up with high-end art and luxury houses without help.
He did business with global banks.
A bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him, one of which was used to buy the art, and American banks, well, they funneled 73 million dollars into the States, some of which was used to buy that California mansion.
And he didn't do all of this in his own name either.
He used shell companies. He used one to buy the property, and another, which was in somebody else's name, to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place.
And then there's Dan Etete.
Well, when he was oil minister, he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that, guess what, yeah, he was the hidden owner of.
Now, it was then much later traded on with the kind assistance of the Nigerian government -- now I have to be careful what I say here — to subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni, two of the biggest oil companies around.
So the reality is, is that the engine of corruption, well, it exists far beyond the shores of countries like Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.
Now let's take the banks first.
Well, it's not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money, but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too.
For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.
Now this region, it has just five percent of its forests left intact.
Five percent.
So how did that happen?
Well, because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years.
And HSBC, well, we know that HSBC bankrolled the region's largest logging companies that were responsible for some of that destruction in Sarawak and elsewhere.
The bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process, but it earned around 130 million dollars.
Now shortly after our exposé, very shortly after our exposé earlier this year, the bank announced a policy review on this.
And is this progress?
Maybe, but we're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case.
And then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies.
Well, we've all heard about what they are, I think, and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society, also known as taxes.
But what doesn't usually come to light is how shell companies are used to steal huge sums of money, transformational sums of money, from poor countries.
In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated, shell companies have appeared, and sometimes it's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal.
A recent study by the World Bank looked at 200 cases of corruption.
It found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies, totaling almost 56 billion dollars.
Now many of these companies were in America or the United Kingdom, its overseas territories and Crown dependencies, and so it's not just an offshore problem, it's an on-shore one too.
You see, shell companies, they're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens.
One striking recent case that we've investigated is how the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo sold off a series of valuable, state-owned mining assets to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands.
So we spoke to sources in country, trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal.
And we were alarmed to find that these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to major international mining companies listed in London.
Now, the Africa Progress Panel, led by Kofi Annan, they've calculated that Congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals.
That's almost twice the country's annual health and education budget combined.
And will the people of Congo, will they ever get their money back?
Well, the answer to that question, and who was really involved and what really happened, well that's going to probably remain locked away in the secretive company registries of the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it.
And how about the oil, gas and mining companies?
Okay, maybe it's a bit of a cliché to talk about them.
Corruption in that sector, no surprise.
There's corruption everywhere, so why focus on that sector?
Well, because there's a lot at stake.
In 2011, natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Nineteen to one.
Now that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities and hospitals and business startups, many of which haven't materialized and never will because some of that money has simply been stolen away.
Now let's go back to the oil and mining companies, and let's go back to Dan Etete and that $1 billion deal.
And now forgive me, I'm going to read the next bit because it's a very live issue, and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right.
Now, on the surface, the deal appeared straightforward.
Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni paid the Nigerian government for the block.
The Nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount, to the very dollar, to an account earmarked for a shell company whose hidden owner was Etete.
Now, that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer.
And here's the thing.
Now, it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went.
I mean, these are state assets.
They're supposed to be used for the benefit of the people in the country.
But in some countries, citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even risked their lives to do so.
And finally, well, there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable.
It's just how some business is done.
It's too complex and difficult to change.
So in effect, what?
We just accept it.
But as a campaigner and investigator, I have a different view, because I've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum.
In the oil and mining sector, for example, there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems.
In 1999, when Global Witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent, well, some people laughed at the extreme naiveté of that small idea.
But literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency, and now it's fast becoming the norm and the law.
Two thirds of the value of the world's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws.
Two thirds.
So this is change happening.
This is progress.
But we're not there yet, by far.
Because it really isn't about corruption somewhere over there, is it?
In a globalized world, corruption is a truly globalized business, and one that needs global solutions, supported and pushed by us all, as global citizens, right here.
Thank you.
(Applause)When we talk about corruption, there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind.
There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs. Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them. Until his death in 2006, he was the all-powerful leader of Turkmenistan, a Central Asian country rich in natural gas.
Now, he really loved to issue presidential decrees.
He was a slightly unusual guy.
And then there's that cliché, the African dictator or minister or official.
There's Teodorín Obiang.
So his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record.
The vast majority of its people are living in really miserable poverty despite an income per capita that's on a par with that of Portugal. So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself a $30 million mansion in Malibu, California.
I've been up to its front gates.
And there's Dan Etete. Well, he was the former oil minister of Nigeria under President Abacha, and it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too.
We've spent a great deal of time investigating a $1 billion -- that's right, a $1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with, and what we found was pretty shocking, but more about that later.
So it's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there, carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we, personally, may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on.
But does it just happen over there?
Well, at 22, I was very lucky.
My first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory.
And that's how my relationship with corruption really began.
In 1993, with two friends who were colleagues, Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley, we set up an organization called Global Witness.
Our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia.
So a few years later, and it's now 1997, and I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds.
Perhaps you saw the film, the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond," the one with Leonardo DiCaprio. Well, some of that sprang from our work.
Luanda, it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets, and a tiny, very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal.
And it was a slightly crazy place.
So I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed.
But it wasn't about blood diamonds.
Because I'd been speaking to lots of people there who, well, they talked about a different problem: that of a massive web of corruption on a global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing.
And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people, trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge.
So let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier.
Well, he didn't end up with high-end art and luxury houses without help.
And he didn't do all of this in his own name either.
He used shell companies. He used one to buy the property, and another, which was in somebody else's name, to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place.
And then there's Dan Etete.
Now, it was then much later traded on with the kind assistance of the Nigerian government -- now I have to be careful what I say here — to subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni, two of the biggest oil companies around.
So the reality is, is that the engine of corruption, well, it exists far beyond the shores of countries like Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.
Now let's take the banks first.
Now this region, it has just five percent of its forests left intact.

Well, because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years.

And will the people of Congo, will they ever get their money back?

(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Robbie Mizzone: Thank you. Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.
It's such an honor.
Like he said, we're three brothers from New Jersey -- you know, the bluegrass capital of the world.
And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14, and I play the fiddle.
So, it started when Jonny was little, and he first started the banjo, he would play on his back with his eyes closed, and we'd say it looked like he was sleeping.
It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds.
I started to imagine what this would look like.
So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.
At Microsoft Applied Sciences, along with my mentor Cati Boulanger, I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace.
(Applause) Because windows and files have a position in the real space, selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.
What would such a future look like?
Today, we started by talking about the boundary, but if we remove this boundary, the only boundary left is our imagination.
There were no clouds in the sky.
That's part of you up there.
That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals.
" In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that.
" And so three days later, driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only two percent actually do.
These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere. They can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous standing under them. Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.
There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.
And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues. I've learned to respect the lightning. My hair used to be straight. (Laughter) I'm just kidding.
All my relations.Thank you. (Applause)Everything is interconnected.
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.
We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.
There were no clouds in the sky.
And after a while I began to perspire.
And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, "Look, do you see that?
That's part of you up there.
That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals.

At 7:45 a. m. , I open the doors to a building dedicated to building, yet only breaks me down.
I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day by regular janitors, but I never have the decency to honor their names.
Lockers left open like teenage boys' mouths when teenage girls wear clothes that covers their insecurities but exposes everything else.
Masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers, camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed but need hugs.
Teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here.
Oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons but never learn to swim, part like the Red Sea when the bell rings. This is a training ground.
My high school is Chicago, diverse and segregated on purpose.
Social lines are barbed wire.
Labels like "Regulars" and "Honors" resonate.
I am an Honors but go home with Regular students who are soldiers in territory that owns them.
This is a training ground to sort out the Regulars from the Honors, a reoccurring cycle built to recycle the trash of this system.
Trained at a young age to capitalize, letters taught now that capitalism raises you but you have to step on someone else to get there.
This is a training ground where one group is taught to lead and the other is made to follow.
No wonder so many of my people spit bars, because the truth is hard to swallow. The need for degrees has left so many people frozen.
Homework is stressful, but when you go home every day and your home is work, you don't want to pick up any assignments.
Reading textbooks is stressful, but reading does not matter when you feel your story is already written, either dead or getting booked.
Taking tests is stressful, but bubbling in a Scantron does not stop bullets from bursting.
I hear education systems are failing, but I believe they're succeeding at what they're built to do -- to train you, to keep you on track, to track down an American dream that has failed so many of us all.

(Applause)
I have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse, or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse.
(Laughter) Both my parents were educators, my maternal grandparents were educators, and for the past 40 years, I've done the same thing.
And so, needless to say, over those years I've had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives.
Some of those reforms have been good.
Some of them have been not so good.
And we know why kids drop out.
We know why kids don't learn.
It's either poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences. . . We know why.
But one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection. Relationships. James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship.
George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships.
Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult.
For years, I have watched people teach.
I have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst.
A colleague said to me one time, "They don't pay me to like the kids.
They pay me to teach a lesson.
The kids should learn it.
I should teach it, they should learn it, Case closed.
" Well, I said to her, "You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like.
" (Laughter) (Applause) She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey.
" And I said to her, "Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear.
" Needless to say, it was.
Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship, or you don't.
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea.
He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand, as opposed to being understood. Simple things, like apologizing.
You ever thought about that?
Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.
(Laughter) I taught a lesson once on ratios.
I'm not real good with math, but I was working on it.
(Laughter) And I got back and looked at that teacher edition.
I'd taught the whole lesson wrong.
(Laughter) So I came back to class the next day and I said, "Look, guys, I need to apologize.
I taught the whole lesson wrong.
I'm so sorry.
" They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson. You were so excited, we just let you go.
" I have had classes that were so low, so academically deficient, that I cried.
I wondered, "How am I going to take this group, in nine months, from where they are to where they need to be?
And it was difficult, it was awfully hard.
How do I raise the self-esteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time?
One year I came up with a bright idea.
I told all my students, "You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students, they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it.
" One of the students said, "Really?
" (Laughter) I said, "Really. We have to show the other classes how to do it, so when we walk down the hall, people will notice us, so you can't make noise.
You just have to strut.
" (Laughter) And I gave them a saying to say: "I am somebody.
I was somebody when I came.
I'll be a better somebody when I leave.
" And they said, "Yeah!
" I said, "Yes.
" (Laughter) He said, "Then why'd you put a smiley face?
" I said, "Because you're on a roll.
You got two right.
You didn't miss them all.
" (Laughter) I said, "And when we review this, won't you do better?
"+2" said, "I ain't all bad.
And so she kept those things in her desk, and years later, after she retired, I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker, you made a difference in my life.
You made it work for me.
And I want you to just see what I've become.
" And when my mama died two years ago at 92, there were so many former students at her funeral, it brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone, but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear.
Can we stand to have more relationships? Absolutely. Will you like all your children?
Of course not.
(Laughter) And you know your toughest kids are never absent.
(Laughter) Never.
It's the connection. It's the relationships.
Teaching and learning should bring joy.
Is this job tough?
You betcha. Oh God, you betcha.
But it is not impossible.
Thank you so much.
Some of those reforms have been good.
Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult.
They pay me to teach a lesson.
" (Laughter) I said, "Really. We have to show the other classes how to do it, so when we walk down the hall, people will notice us, so you can't make noise.
I have things to do, people to impress, and places to go.
A student missed 18. I put a "+2" on his paper and a big smiley face.
" You see, "-18" sucks all the life out of you.
See, it's hard to teach kids who stink.
(Laughter) And kids can be cruel.
And so she kept those things in her desk, and years later, after she retired, I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker, you made a difference in my life.
You made it work for me.
You made me feel like I was somebody, when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.
And I want you to just see what I've become.
" And when my mama died two years ago at 92, there were so many former students at her funeral, it brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone, but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear.
Can we stand to have more relationships? Absolutely. Will you like all your children?
Of course not.
(Laughter) And you know your toughest kids are never absent.
(Laughter) Never.
You won't like them all, and the tough ones show up for a reason.
It's the connection. It's the relationships.
So teachers become great actors and great actresses, and we come to work when we don't feel like it, and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense, and we teach anyway.
We teach anyway, because that's what we do.
Teaching and learning should bring joy.
How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks, who were not afraid to think, and who had a champion?
Every child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.
We can do this.
We're educators.
We're born to make a difference.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
These days scientists know how you inherit characteristics from your parents.
They're able to calculate probabilities of having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease according to the information from the parents and the family history.
But how is this possible?
To understand how traits pass from one living being to its descendants, we need to go back in time to the 19th century and a man named Gregor Mendel.
Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants.
By breeding the pea plants he was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles that rule heredity.
In one of most classic examples, Mendel combined a purebred yellow-seeded plant with a purebred green-seeded plant, and he got only yellow seeds.
He called the yellow-colored trait the dominant one, because it was expressed in all the new seeds.
Then he let the new yellow-seeded hybrid plants self-fertilize.
And in this second generation, he got both yellow and green seeds, which meant the green trait had been hidden by the dominant yellow.
He called this hidden trait the recessive trait.
From those results, Mendel inferred that each trait depends on a pair of factors, one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father.
Now we know that these factors are called alleles and represent the different variations of a gene.
Depending on which type of allele Mendel found in each seed, we can have what we call a homozygous pea, where both alleles are identical, and what we call a heterozygous pea, when the two alleles are different.
This combination of alleles is known as genotype and its result, being yellow or green, is called phenotype.
To clearly visualize how alleles are distributed amongst descendants, we can a diagram called the Punnett square.
You place the different alleles on both axes and then figure out the possible combinations.
Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example. Let's write the dominant yellow allele as an uppercase "Y" and the recessive green allele as a lowercase "y. " The uppercase Y always overpowers his lowercase friend, so the only time you get green babies is if you have lowercase Y's.
In Mendel's first generation, the yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid a yellow-dominant allele, and the green homozygous pea dad will give a green-recessive allele.
So all the pea kids will be yellow heterozygous.
Then, in the second generation, where the two heterozygous kids marry, their babies could have any of the three possible genotypes, showing the two possible phenotypes in a three-to-one proportion.
But even peas have a lot of characteristics.
For example, besides being yellow or green, peas may be round or wrinkled.
So we could have all these possible combinations: round yellow peas, round green peas, wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled green peas.
To calculate the proportions for each genotype and phenotype, we can use a Punnett square too.
Of course, this will make it a little more complex.
And lots of things are more complicated than peas, like, say, people.
But, it all started with Mendel and his peas.These days scientists know how you inherit characteristics from your parents.
They're able to calculate probabilities of having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease according to the information from the parents and the family history.
But how is this possible?

What are we going to do?
Okay?
What do they eat?
What are we going to do?

A morning that I will never forget.
So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed to be outside alone, to a secret school. It was the only way we both could be educated.
Each day, we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going.
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were we being followed?
Do they know where we live?
We were scared, but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan, he insisted that his daughter, my mom, go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
There she is.
She retired two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father -- that's him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.
There was no question that his children would receive an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children. During Taliban years, I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future.
I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life.
Your money can be stolen.
You can be forced to leave your home during a war.
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees, we will.
So do you still not want to continue?
" Today I am 22. I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war. Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school, and had my family not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.
(Applause) When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters, was among the first to congratulate me.
He not only brags about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul.
(Applause) My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me. That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOLA, the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity.
And I see their parents and their fathers who, like my own, advocate for them, despite and even in the face of daunting opposition.
Like Ahmed.
That's not his real name, and I cannot show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village, and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes.
As he arrived home, the phone rang, a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.
"Kill me now, if you wish," he said, "but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas.
" What I've come to realize about Afghanistan, and this is something that is often dismissed in the West, that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success.
It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.
In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters, but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan, we must have the support of men.
Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.
(Applause) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U. S. troops' withdrawal.
But when I am back in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and lasting change.
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities, and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that.
Like me, they are dreaming big. Thank you. (Applause)When I was 11, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house. My father was listening to BBC News on his small, gray radio.
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then, because the news mostly depressed him.
"The Taliban are gone!
" my father shouted.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school now," he said.
A morning that I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed to be outside alone, to a secret school. It was the only way we both could be educated.
Each day, we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going.
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.

" And the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that.
You know?
You can be anything. You could be the President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first one.
To understand the phenomenon of color, it helps to think about light as a wave.
But, before we get to that, let's talk a little bit about waves in general. Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the ocean watching a cork bob up and down in the water.
The first thing you notice about the motion is that it repeats itself.
The cork traces the same path over and over again. . . up and down, up and down.
That is, how many of them go by in one second.
If you know how many seconds one full wave takes, then it's easy to work out how many waves go by in one second.
And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect. It's called color.
That's right. Color is nothing more than a measure of how quickly the light waves are waving.
If our eyes were quick enough, we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly, like we can with the cork and the ocean.
The pencil looks yellow because it reflects yellow light more than it reflects the other colors.
What happens to the blue, purple and red light?
But nevertheless, neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing.
Here's one example: Neuro drinks, a line of products, including Nuero Bliss here, which according to its label helps reduce stress, enhances mood, provides focused concentration, and promotes a positive outlook.
I have to say, this sounds awesome.
(Laughter) I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago. So when this came up in my local shop, naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims.
So I went to the company's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products.
But I didn't find any.
Trial or no trial, these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain.
And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties.
A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article.
For half the people, the article included a brain image, and for the other half, it was the same article but it didn't have a brain image.
At the end — you see where this is going — people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article.
So this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image.
And this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image. So the take-home message here is, do you want to sell it?
Put a brain on it.
Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades, and we're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain.
Like, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.
Really cool stuff.
But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations and some overblown, unproven claims.
So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves, dead giveaways, really, for what's variously been called neuro-bunk, neuro-bollocks, or, my personal favorite, neuro-flapdoodle. So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people's thoughts and emotions.
Here's a study published by a team of researchers as an op-ed in The New York Times.
The headline?
"You Love Your iPhone. Literally. " It quickly became the most emailed article on the site.
So how'd they figure this out?
They put 16 people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iPhones.
The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula, a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion.
So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula, this meant the subjects loved their iPhones.
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning, and that's that the insula does a lot.
Sure, it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion, but it's also involved in tons of other processes, like memory, language, attention, even anger, disgust and pain.
So based on the same logic, I could equally conclude you hate your iPhone.
The point here is, when you see activation in the insula, you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation from off this list, and it's a really long list.
My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.
So speaking of love and the brain, there's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love, who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together, the source of love and prosperity.
You've probably heard of it.
So, Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people's oxytocin, this increases their trust, empathy and cooperation.
Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy.
It increases gloating.
What about the clinic?
These scans, the clinics say, can help prevent Alzheimer's disease, solve weight and addiction issues, overcome marital conflicts, and treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.
Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business.
The answers shouldn't be simple, because the brain isn't simple.
But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway. Thank you. (Applause)
Hello, Doha. Hello!
Salaam alaikum.
I love coming to Doha.
It's such an international place.
It feels like the United Nations here.
Yeah?
And then a Swedish guy showed me my room. I said, "Where are the Qataris?
" (Laughter) (Applause) They said, "No, no, it's too hot.
They come out later. They're smart. " "They know.
" (Laughter) And of course, it's growing so fast, sometimes there's growing pains.
You know, like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well, but they don't know it that well.
My Indian cab driver showed up at the W, and I asked him to take me to the Sheraton, and he said, "No problem, sir.
" And then we sat there for two minutes.
I said, "What's wrong?
" He said, "One problem, sir.
" (Laughter) I said, "What?
" He goes, "Where is it?
" (Laughter) I go, "You're the driver, you should know.
" I go, "You just arrived at the W?
" "No, I just arrived in Doha, sir.
" (Laughter) "I was on my way home from the airport, I got a job. I'm working already.
" (Laughter) He goes, "Sir, why don't you drive?
" (Laughter) "I don't know where we're going.
Are there any Lebanese here tonight, by applause?
You know the Middle East is going crazy when Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region. (Laughter) (Applause) Who would have thought?
(Laughter) Oh my gosh.
No, there's serious issues in the region.
Some people don't want to talk about them.
I'm here to talk about them tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East, here's a serious issue.
When we see each other, when we say hello, how many kisses are we going to do?
(Laughter) Every country is different and it's confusing, okay?
In Lebanon, they do three.
In Egypt, they do two.
I was in Lebanon, I got used to three.
I went to Egypt. I went to say hello to this one Egyptian guy, I went, one, two. I went for three -- He wasn't into it.
(Laughter) I told him, I said, "No, no, I was just in Lebanon.
" He goes, "I don't care where you were. You just stay where you are, please.
" (Laughter) (Applause) I went to Saudi Arabia.
In Saudi Arabia, they go one, two, and then they stay on the same side: three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 -- (Laughter) Next time you see a Saudi, look closely.
They're just a little bit tilted.
(Laughter) "Abdul, are you okay?
" "I was saying hello for half an hour.
I'll be all right.
" (Laughter) Qataris, you guys do the nose to nose.
Why is that? Are you too tired to go all the way around?
(Laughter) "Habibi, it's so hot.
Just come here for a second.
Say hello.
Hello, Habibi.
Just don't move.
Just stay there, please.
I need to rest.
" (Laughter) Iranians, sometimes we do two, sometimes we do three.
A friend of mine explained to me, before the '79 revolution, it was two.
(Laughter) After the revolution, three.
So with Iranians, you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you.
Yeah, if you go one, two, three -- "I can't believe you support this regime!
" (Laughter) "With your three kisses.
I'm Iranian and American. I'm there. I know, I've traveled here.
There's so much, we laugh, right?
People don't know we laugh.
When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour, it came out on Comedy Central, I went online to see what people were saying.
I ended up on a conservative website.
One guy wrote another guy. He said, "I never knew these people laughed.
" Think about it. You never see us laughing in American film or television, right?
Maybe like an evil laugh: "Wuhahaha.
" (Laughter) "I will kill you in the name of Allah, wuhahahahaha.
" (Laughter) But never like, "Ha ha ha ha la.
" (Laughter) We like to laugh.
We like to celebrate life.
And I wish more Americans would travel here.
I always encourage my friends: "Travel, see the Middle East, there's so much to see, so many good people.
" And it's vice versa, and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening.
For example, I don't know if you heard about this, a little while ago in the US, there was a Muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane, talking about the safest place to sit on the plane.
Some passengers overheard them, somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk, got them kicked off the plane.
It was a family, a mother, father, child, talking about the seating.
As a Middle Eastern male, I know there's certain things I'm not supposed to say on an airplane in the US, right?
I'm not supposed to be walking down the aisle, and be like, "Hi, Jack.
" That's not cool.
(Laughter) Even if I'm there with my friend named Jack, I say, "Greetings, Jack. Salutations, Jack.
" Never "Hi, Jack.
(Laughter) The next time you're on an airplane in the US, just speak your mother tongue.
That way no one knows what you're saying.
" The key, to my Arab brothers and sisters, is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as you're walking down the aisle.
Just as you're walking down -- (Imitating Arabic) Strawberry!
(Laughter) "I think he's going to hijack the plane with some ice cream.
(Cheers) (Applause)
But what I'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models.
They're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy.
So with disease models like these, we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.
This is another example of patient-specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa.
And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next, and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies.
Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body. Our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology, helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster, more cheaply and more effectively.
It gives new meaning to models against animal testing, doesn't it? Thank you. (Applause)
I'm a designer and an educator.
I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?
Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking.
A couple of examples. Look at that. This is my multitasking activity result. (Laughter) So trying to cook, answering the phone, writing SMS, and maybe uploading some pictures about this awesome barbecue.
So someone tells us the story about supertaskers, so this two percent of people who are able to control multitasking environment.
But what about ourselves, and what about our reality?
When's the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend?
So this is a project I'm working on, and this is a series of front covers to downgrade our super, hyper — (Laughter) (Applause) to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones into the essence of their function.
Another example: Have you ever been to Venice?
How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island.
But our multitasking reality is pretty different, and full of tons of information.
So what about something like that to rediscover our sense of adventure?
I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge, but I push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task, or maybe turning your digital senses totally off. So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.
Thank you. (Applause)
There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives.
(Laughter) How can we lend and borrow more things, without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time?
How can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and gain a better understanding of our landscape?
How can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts, so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today?
Now, I live in New Orleans, and I am in love with New Orleans.
My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees, shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years, and I trust a city that always makes way for music.
I feel like every time someone sneezes, New Orleans has a parade.
(Laughter) The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much. Her name was Joan, and she was a mother to me. And her death was sudden and unexpected.
And I thought about death a lot. And . . . this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had. And . . . brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now.
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life.
I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, and forget what really matters to you.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out, and it kept growing.
And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall.
"Before I die, I want to be tried for piracy.
" (Laughter) "Before I die, I want to straddle the International Dateline.
" "Before I die, I want to sing for millions. " "Before I die, I want to plant a tree.
" "Before I die, I want to live off the grid.
" "Before I die, I want to hold her one more time. " "Before I die, I want to be someone's cavalry.
" "Before I die, I want to be completely myself.
" So this neglected space became a constructive one, and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud, tear up, and they consoled me during my own tough times.
It's about knowing you're not alone; it's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways; it's about making space for reflection and contemplation, and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time, and our relationships with other people.
In our age of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective, and remember that life is brief and tender.
Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about, or even think about, but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do.
Thinking about death clarifies your life.
Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us, as individuals and as a community, and with more ways to share our hopes, fears and stories, the people around us can not only help us make better places, they can help us lead better lives.
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
Literary critic Northrop Frye once observed that in our primitive days, our literary heroes were -- well, nearly gods, and as civilization advanced, they came down the mountain of the gods, so to speak, and became more human, more flawed, less heroic.
From the divine heroes like Hercules, down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as Beowulf, the great leaders such as King Arthur, and the great but flawed heroes like Macbeth or Othello.
Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, or Hiccup, until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero.
Contrary to the sound, the anti-hero is not the villain, not the antagonist.
The anti-hero, however, at best demonstrates a few underdeveloped traits, at worst, is totally inept.
The story of the anti-hero usually unfolds something like this.
The anti-hero initially conforms, ignorantly accepting the established views, a typical, unquestioning, brainwashed member of society.
The anti-hero struggles to conform, all the while starting to object, perhaps finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions, and naïvely, unwisely, sharing those questions with an authority figure.
The anti-hero openly challenges society, and tries to fight against the lies and tactics used to oppress the populace.
This step, for the anti-hero, is seldom a matter of brave, wise and heroic opposition.
Maybe the anti-hero fights and succeeds in destroying the oppressive government, with a lot of impossible luck.
Perhaps he or she runs away, escapes to fight another day.
All too often though, the anti-hero is killed, or brainwashed to return to conformity with the masses.
No heroic triumph here, no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern world, inspiring others to fight, or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive army of the evil empire.
Our storytelling ancestors calmed our fears of powerlessness by giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demons and monsters that we suspected haunted the night beyond our campfires.
But eventually, we realized the monsters did not lie out there, they reside inside of us.
Beowulf's greatest enemy was mortality.
Othello's, jealousy.
Hiccup, self-doubt.
And in the tales of the ineffectual anti-hero, in the stories of Guy Montag and Winston Smith, lie the warnings of contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fears: that we are not strong enough to defeat the monsters.
Only this time, not the monsters chased away by the campfire, but the very monsters who built the campfire in the first place.
So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.
It makes me to stand here, the fame, the money I got out of it.
So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.
What you did in the early marriage days, you tried to impress your wife.
I did the same.
On that occasion, I found my wife carrying something like this.
I saw.
"What is that?
" I asked.
My wife replied, "None of your business.
" Then, being her husband, I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth.
I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days.
Then I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?
She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads], but myself and my sisters, if they start using that, we have to cut our family milk budget.
Then I was shocked.
What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget?
And it's called affordability.
I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.
I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.
That fellow looks left and right, and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper, gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.
I don't know why.
I did not ask for a condom.
Then I took that pad.
I want to see that. What is inside it?
The very first time, at the age of 29, that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.
I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?
They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad, where can I check it?
It's not like I can just check it in the lab.
I need a woman volunteer.
Where can I get one in India?
Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.
So only problem: the only available victim is my wife.
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.
"Close your eyes.
Whatever I give, it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring, even a chocolate, I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.
Close your eyes.
" Because I tried to make it intimate.
Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.
(Laughter) So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.
Then other victims, they got into my sisters.
But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.
That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.
Why I am not getting [any]?
You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.
Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
They also refused.
Finally, I decide, use sanitary pad myself.
Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon. Armstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest, like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe.
I wore a sanitary pad.
I filled animal blood in a football bottle, I tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties, while I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press, doses of blood will go there.
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect.
That five days I'll never forget -- the messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.
My God, it's unbelievable.
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton.
It's not working.
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.
You need first funds.
Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research, I come through all sorts of problems, including a divorce notice from my wife.
Why is this?
I used medical college girls.
She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls.
Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood, but even after that, you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material.
Again, a stop-up.
Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.
In this machine, any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant, anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.
That is my invention.
So after that, what I did, usually if anyone got a patent or an invention, immediately you want to make, convert into this.
I never did this.
I dropped it just like this, because you do this, if anyone runs after money, their life will not [have] any beauty.
It is boredom.
A lot of people making a lot of money, billion, billions of dollars accumulating.
Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?
Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India, for rural women, because in India, [you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women are using sanitary pads.
The rest, they're using a rag cloth, a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.
It is the same in the 21st century.
That's why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.
So far, 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries.
Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational, transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark.
A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.
(Applause) Play video one.
(Video) Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?
" She replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start using napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget.
" Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?
So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups.
That is my idea.
AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment for machine and all.
Now, any rural woman can.
They are performing puja.
(Video): (Singing) You just think, competing giants, even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.
I'm sustaining on seventh year.
Already 600 installations.
What is my mission?
I'm going to make India [into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.
In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create.
That's why I'm not running after this bloody money.
I'm doing something serious.
If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.
Do your job simply, the girl will chase you.
Like that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.
Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man.
That's all.
A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad.
I am becoming a solution provider.
I'm very happy.
I don't want to make this as a corporate entity.
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe.
That's why I put all the details on public domain like an open software.
Now 110 countries are accessing it.
Okay?
So I classify the people into three: uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.
Little educated, done this.
Surplus educated, what are you going to do for the society?
Thank you very much.
Bye!
(Applause)
Today I have just one request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, tall and very handsome.
He's speechless, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless.
He's not greedy.
He doesn't see skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this: He has never told a lie.
When he sings songs from our childhood, attempting words that not even I could remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome.
He has the most impeccable memory.
He has a selective one, though.
He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar, but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod, conversations we had when he was four, weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies, and Lady Gaga's birthday.
Don't they sound incredible?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into society's version of normal, they're often bypassed and misunderstood.
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case, although they were not seen as ordinary, this could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It manifests in each individual differently, hence why Remi is so different from Sam.
