In March 2021, fierce winds blew a container ship off courseIn most places, this would have caused a minor incidentBut in the Suez Canal, it was a global crisisThis vessel wasn't just blocking other shipsIt was obstructing the flow of international trade through one of the world's most important waterwaysThe side of the Suez Canal has been of interest to rulers of this region as far back as the second millennium BCETo move goods between Asia and the Mediterranean basin, traders had to traverse the narrow isthmus separating the Red Sea and the Nile, journeying and camelbound caravans through the unforgiving desertA maritime passage between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea would bypass this trip altogether and throughout the 16th century, multiple powers attempted to construct such a canal, but their plans were obstructed by cost, political strife, and the ever-shifting sandsIn 1798, interest in building a canal was rekindledThis time, attracting attention from across EuropeOver the fallen decades, individuals from Austria, Italy, Britain, and France pitched their plans to Egypt's rulersAt the time Egypt was a territory of the Ottoman Empire, which was resistant to these proposalsBut Egypt's political and economic autonomy was gradually increasing and its government was eager to pursue the projectOnce I ate Pasha came into power in 1854, he approved a plan from the enterprising, an appeal to French diplomat, Ferdinand, Della Sets, signed in 1854 and 1856, a pair of concessions gave Della Sets authority to establish the Suez Canal Company and finance it by selling shares to capitalists of all nationsThe contracts between Saeed Pasha and the Canal Company also promised a workforce of hundreds of thousands of Egyptian workersBeginning in 1862, about 20,000 laborers, or forcibly recruited every month, digging the canal and harsh desert conditions without easy access to food or waterDiseases like cholera ran rampant and workers toiled under the threat of whipsThe estimates of those who died during construction range into the thousandsIn 1864, the new Egyptian ruler, Ismai al Pasha, put an end to the coerced Egyptian labor, but he's still pressed forward with constructionForeign workers from all over Europe and the Middle East, labored alongside directors and bucket excavators to remove 74 million cubic meters of dirtThis massive population of workers required infrastructure to deliver drinking water and other supplies, giving rise to a flourishing economy of restaurants, rothles, and smuggled goodsThe myths of the bustle will bring three new cities with multi-ethnic populationsPort Said on the northern Mediterranean shore is Maya Leia on the Canal's middle tract and port to Fique at the southern edge of the CanalThe construction site bypassed the Nile and ran directly from Port Said to SuezAnd after years of work, the streams of the two seas finally began merging in the May 1860sThe finished canal was 164 kilometers long with a width of 56 meters at the surface and it was officially inaugurated on November 17th, 1869While it struggled financially during its first few years, the canal ended up dramatically accelerating global tradeIt also facilitated the migration of numerous marine species, dramatically changing, local ecosystems and cuisineOver the decades, traffic threw the canal brood, but in 1875 financial issues forced Egypt to sell much of its stock in the canal company, allowing Britain to take overIt was only in 1956 that control of the canal fully reverted to Egypt when it was nationalized at President Gamal Abdel NasserThis move sparked a military standoff between Egypt and Britain, France, and IsraelOnce resolved, it transformed the canal into a major source of Egypt's national revenue and helped redeem the canal's imperialist legacyToday, nearly 30% of all global ship traffic passes through the Suez Canal, totaling over 20,000 ships in 2021However, the incident of the ever-given is a stark reminder of just how fragile our man-made systems can beThe King's and Queen's of Kush would go on to successfully challenge two of the most dominant empires in historyFrom 1500 to 1100 BCE, Egypt controlled Kush, introducing many Egyptian cultural and religious practicesThe civilization of Kush was more than a thousand years old at that timeIts early capital city at Kerma had impressive temples, palaces, and houses, including a massive mud brick temple structure that had a chapel deep inside, reached by a long staircase at the centerRich gold mines helped the Kushites build a flourishing commercial network, making bronze weapons and tools and trading materials like incense, animal skins, ivory and Ebony wood from Sub-Saharan AfricaThe tide started to change for Kush as Egypt descended into civil warBy 750 BCE, Egypt was divided into local kingdoms with fluctuating alliancesThe Kushite king Piyanki saw an opportunityHe led his navy, flanked by horsemen and archers, up the Nile to the gateway city of him and himAs Piyanki's army constructed sea-drams and battle towers, the city's ruler sent his wives and daughters to negotiate, not with Piyanki, but with the women of his royal householdlater known as Kandikek, who were extremely influential in military affairs and political successionAt the end of a long siege, Piyanki entered the Concord city and bitterly criticized the conditions in its stablesFrom there, Piyanki and the Kushite forces conquered the Egyptian capital of MemphisPiyanki installed his sister, Amunirdis, as priestess of the Great God Amun in the Egyptian city of Thieves, and left other Kushite officials there before returning to live in KushHis successor's extended control all the way to the Nile DeltaThis was a high point for the Empire of Kush, trade thrived and they built magnificent temples, palaces, and pyramid tombs all along the NileBut the Assyrian army was approaching Egypt in its annual campaignsWhen the Assyrians began to encroach on trade roots near Jerusalem, the Kushite king to Harco moved to stop themThe Assyrians defeated him with the help of some Rebelling Egyptian Prinsives and drove him out of Egypt in the 7th century BCEThe Kushites continued to rule in their homeland for nearly 1,000 years that were prosperous and innovativeThey moved to their capital farther south to the city of Meadowi, where they built temples to a new god called Apede-MakThey built new cities in the Savannah south of the Sahara Desert, some of which contained huge reservoirs for waterWhen the Roman Empire conquered Egypt in 31 BCE, Kushite armies again traveled north, led by Queen Amani ReynasShe led them to success in battle against the Romans, capturing the bronze head of the statue of the Roman Emperor Augustus and bringing it back to KushThey barriaded under the doorway of the temple in the capital, so that worshippers would step on it as they crossed the thresholdAfter brokering peace with the Romans, Kush continued to prosperOver time, however, groups of people called the Noba braided from the West and trade routes were disrupted by the rising kingdom of OxenAround 350 CE, the Oxenite King Sacked Motore, effectively bringing Kushite rule to an endSince then, some have argued that Kush's history has been overlooked by generations of European and American scholars, who promoted the idea that Egypt part of the origin of Western civilization, while Kush as an African culture was excludedToday, there's still much to learn about Kush, including a writing system we haven't deciphered foodWhen I'm out of the grocery store or maybe a restaurant or the park with my son, he's six and a halfPeople will stop us and mention that they think that he's handsomeI agreeThough he used that opportunity to chop it up with him and often when they're done talking with him, they'll mention that he's smart and engaging in little guyWhen those people walk away, the thought that comes to my mind is that I hope they remember meeting him as a child when they see him again as a grown manThis thought comes to my mind because I've written two books about race and racism and the United States and this kind of work can produce feelings of pessimismOne of the things that I've learned is that American Southern Orientation toward progressThis context that means is that we often celebrate the distance between where we were and where we are nowBut that same orientation can bind us from the gap between where we are and where we could or should beThe other thing that I've learned about Americans is that we have a very, very narrow understanding of racismMostly in the minds and hearts of people, usually old people, old people from the southAnd this really narrow definition can constrain our opportunities to produce some more racially egalitarian societyWe like to hunt for racists in distance ourselves from people who say mean things about whole groups of people or who idealize the 1950sBut the fact of the matter is that we might just need to look in the mirrorNow I'm not saying that everyone here is a racist, but what I am saying is that everyone here has the capacity and perhaps even the propensity to live their life in a way, to make decisions, to rely on biases that reproduce racial inequalitySo people say, well, you do all this work about racism, what's the answer? And I say that the first thing we might need to do is to come to a shared understanding about what recent racism is in the first placeHistory shows that racism has had the upper hand in deciding who the race is to star and what racism is and it's never the thing that they doBut maybe if we come together and come to a shared and perhaps a precise definition of what racism is, we can work toward creating a society where mothers like me aren't in constant fear of their children's livesI'd like to dispel three myths about racism on our threat toward mutual understandingFirst, it's true that the South has done its work to earn its reputation as the most racist region, but there are other states and regions that are competing for the titleFor example, if we look at the most segregated states in terms of where black kids go to school will see sure somewhere in the South, there's some out west in the Midwest and in the NortheastThere where we liveOr if we look at states with the biggest racial disparities in terms of prison populations, we see that none of them aren't the South, there where we liveMy colleague Rebecca Kreitz, sir and I, looked at a standard matter of racial attitudes of prejudiceWe found that in the 1990s, states in the South dominated the most racially negative attitudesBut this geography has evolved and things have changedBy 2016, we found that the decoders, Nebraska, states in the Midwest and the Northeast were competing for the most prejudice population titlesNow, I'm not saying that one state is more racist than another, but what I am saying is that every state might have its own special brand of racismAnd it doesn't have to be like thisMost of the inequalities that we see in our day-to-day lives happen at the state and local levelWhat that means is that we don't have to go to all the way to Congress to make change in our communitiesWe can simply hold our city, our county, our state legislators to task to produce more equitable outcomesNip toWe're not that good at hunting for racistRemember that time when the governor of Virginia did black face and people were like, ooh, that's badI mean, the convent racist had a hairI was giving all the side eyeAnd here's whyWhile people were going back to your books to look for things that were obviously racist, fewer people were looking into the current day policy scancers of legislators and probably did back phase but didn't get caughtSo how many of us might have supported a candidate who was willing to let neighborhoods to see from their district so that kids could go to all white schools in the 21st centuryOr, how many of us might have supported a ballot measure that systematically reduced some group's chances of voting? Or, how many of us might have focused on the behavior of black mothers, rather than doctors, or healthcare systems and policies, when we learned about the huge racial disparities and maternal and infant mortality? It doesn't have to be like thisWe could do something differentWe could scrutinize the behaviors of the rule makersWe could orient ourselves, put them more just societyAnd on our way there, we can't mystify practical policy solutionsMyth 3If you believe that when all the grandmas and Mississippi die, that racism is gonna go with them, you are in for a big disappointmentWe like to think that young people are going to do the hard work of eradicating racism, but there's some things that we might should knowWe know that young folks, young white folks especially, like diversity, they appreciate it, they're looking for it, but we also know that they don't live diverse livesResearch shows that the average white American literally has one black friendwhat that means is that most don't have any at allSociologists like Santa, Mayurga show that even when well-mitting white folks move to diverse neighborhoods, they don't necessarily have positive interactionsNo less than any with their neighbors who aren't whiteMy research with Professor Christopher Desan to show that when we ask white millennials the Irish or attitudes and policy preferences, that there's sometimes just as in other times, even more racially conservative in boomersWhen we ask them about the things that are important to them, they don't have any particular sense of urgency around questions of racial inequalityHow do we get like this? One of the things we might think about is how we raise our kids and equip them to solve the problems that we want them to solveWe research shows that white parents in particular will either choose to not talk about issues of racism to their kids in order to protect them from a harsh racial reality, or they still color blind lessonsAnd that can actually reinforce negative racial attitudesSo it's kind of like how some of your parents might have given you books about puberty, so they don't have to talk about the words in the bees, and then you try to connect all the dots, and then you did it all wrongIt's like thatIt doesn't have to be like thisWe can do betterWe can have heart conversations with our kids, so that they don't grow up like many of us did, thinking that talking about racism makes you a racistIt doesn'tAnd so that we can prevent them from making the same mistakes that we've seen in the pastRemember, a long, long time ago in 2008, when we were all pining to live in a post-racial world, what I say that it's time for us to think bigger and dream bigger and think about what it would be like to live in a post-racist worldBut in order to do that, we'd have to come together to have a shared definition of racism, not just in the matter of hearts and minds, but in systems, policies, rules, decisions made over and over again to marginalize some people, and agree to become anti-racistPeople who learn more and do betterSo we could ask harder questions of candidates about their stance as on racial inequality before we throw our full weight behind themWe could buy cotton or boycott business systems practices, don't align with our valuesWe could talk to our kids about racismWe could figure out our state's special brand of racism and work to eradicate itPeople made racial disparities and people can unmake themSure, it'll be hardBut the fact of the matter is, is that someone is depending on us, to do nothing at allThank youThank youWhy is 15 degrees such a big deal? Because to warm our entire planet up by 15 degrees Celsius requires a lot of heatAll this extra heat melts glaciers which raise sea levelsIf the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland melt completely, millions of people's homes will be underwaterThe extra heat also intensifies weather, making wet places wetter, dry places drier, and increasing the ferocity of stormsThat 15 degree increase also won't be distributed evenlyThe coldest nights in the Arctic might get 10 degrees warmerThe warmest days in Mumbai might get 5 degrees hotterOver the past 10,000 years, we've been luckyEarth's climate was stable and our civilization's flourishedBut as our climate gets more unstable, solar economies and our societies, we'll all suffer, and the vulnerable will be hit hardest, unless we act nowJune 8th, 2010Russell Wilson, fourth round pick to the Kawaraki's baseballI'm fired up when the highest moment of my lifeEvery kid's dream to be drafted by a Major League baseball teamJune 8th, 2010June 9th, 2010The line goes flatMy dad passes awayHigh as the high to the lowest to the lowJust like thatMy dad laying his death bed just tears running down my face and you know what I do nextAnd my mind racing memories, flashbacks, momentsEarly mornings getting up, taking grounders and throwing, speedouts and deep posts routes to my brother and my dad to early morning car rides to AUbaseball to my dad being the third base coachFast forward to the championship high of winning a Super Bowl holding up the Lombardi trophy and then motions an excitement of it all and blew and green confetti all over the place and knowing that you just won the Super Bowl to a year later the pressure of the game and the ball in the one yard line and this is the chance to win the game and it doesn't work and however many millions and millions of people all over the world watching and having to walk to the median what What do I say next? What do I do? What do I think? Being married at a young age and just coming out of college and everything else to short the after, marriage is not working out and realizing, you know what life happensLife happens, life happens to all of usLots of family members divorce, fear, pain, depression, concerns, worriesWhen you think about being super positive, yes, I'm positive by nature, but positivity, you know, it doesn't always work because when you're down 16, nothing NFC championship game, if people are like Russ, we're not gonna be able to win this game, and it's not a great situation right now, when you're facing cancer, when you have things you have to deal with, or finances, and this and that, how do we deal with it? And it's hard to be positive in the midst of it allAnd what I definitely knew was this, that negativity works a hundred percent of the timeNegativity was gonna get me nowhereI start saying to myself, new or his mercies every morning, new beginnings, new starts, and despite hardship and pain worries and wanting to get through it and how do I do this? I started thinking about a carYou know you guys have drive a car and get stick shift and you want to shift to neutralWell you go from first year to second year all the way to fifthWell you got to know how to shift to neutral and I needed to shift to neutral immediately before I crashedSitting there after the Super Bowl, I had a decision to makeWell I let this define my career well I let it define my lifeHell no, but I found out was thisThe mindset is a skillIt can be taught and learnedI started 10 years ago, training my mind with this guy named Trevor Moe at my mental conditioning coach and he's been with me for 10 years and we've been best friends and partners ever sinceAnd as athletes we train the body, we train ourselves to be able to run fast and throw farther and jump higher and do these different thingsBut why don't we train our mind? What do you want your life to look like? Write it outYou know, talk about itSay itWhat's our language? What does our language look like? Watch these highlights of us of when you're in your your best momentsWhat does that look like? And be thatLive thatSound like thatThe best free throws shoesThey don't worry about the shotThey just missThey think about this shotThis put, this throw, this first downThen I met this kid Milton Wright, 19 years oldHe had cancer three different timesThis day when I went to see Milton, Milton was frustratedWell, so I'm doneI don't want to do this anymoreIt's my time to goI said, Milton, I started telling the story about my dad and how my dad used to say, son, why not you? Why not you graduate early? Why not you play a profile for on ProBass? But why not you? Why not you? Why not you? Why not you? It's just saying, Milton, why not you? If you try to self-therapy and you try this and it doesn't work, you know, you won't rememberSo Milton got a smile on his face and he said, you know what? You're exactly rightYes, I do have cancer, RussBut I can either let this kill me, not just physically, like and also let it kill me emotionally and mentallyAnd I have a choice right now and the and the midst of the problem, and the midst of the storm, to decide to overcomeOne of the questions I always get asked about neutral thinking is this, does that mean I don't have any emotion? I always say absolutely notYeah, we have emotionsWe have real life situationsWe have things to deal with, but what you have to be able to do is to stay focused on the moment and to not be super emotional, it's okay to have emotions, but don't be emotionalWhen people look at me, they see that on the highest pay player in the NFL, they see that I have the girl in Sierra, that I have the family in this and that, but I still have real life situationsWe all doWe all have sadness and loss and depression and worries and fearI didn't just get hereWhat's the truth? And how do I come through this better? And that's really kind of how my mindset at shifting was not just on the success of it all with the failure of itIt was on the processWhat is the next step? How do I do this right here right now? You have a choice to make in lifeFor me, when I was young and I didn't have much, I made a choiceI made a choice that I was going to believe that great things were going to happenThat I was going to have my mindset rightI was going to have the right language and the right things to think about, which helped prepare me for the dayI'm just a humanI just have a ability to throw the ball a long way and run around and make some cool and fun throws and it makes some people smileBut the reality is that I still have pressureI still have worriesI still have fearsI still have things that happenIt still have lossPositiveity can be dangerousBut what always works is negativityAnd never want to live in negativitySo I stayed in neutralI kept my shift in neutralAnd so that's why I livedThat's why I've been living ever sinceHumanity takes center stage at that, but I would like to add a voice for the animals, whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped usSome years ago it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder on an island, not far from VancouverHis name is Jimmy Smith, and he shared a story with me that has told among his people, who called themselves the Quikva SutanukOnce upon a time he told me, all animals on earth were oneEven though they looked different on the outside, inside, they were all the sameAnd from time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unityWhen they arrived, they would all take off their skinsRaven, shed his feathers, bear his fur, and salmon or scalesAnd then they would danceBut one day a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw because he did not understandAnd bearers, the animals fled and that was the last time they revealed themselves this wayThe ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities, all animals are one has been a powerful inspiration to meI like to get past the fur, the feathers and the scalesI want to get under the skinNow matter of whether I'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog, my goal is to connect us with themI do IYou may wonder, do I ever photograph people? SurePeople are always present in my photosNow matter of whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions, you just have to learn how to look past their disguiseAs a photographer, I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thingAnd I use my cameraI drop my skin like the animals at that caveSo I can show who they really areAs animals blessed with the power of rational thought, we can marvel at the intricacies of lifeAs citizens of a planet in trouble, it is a moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in the versatility of lifeBut as humans with hearts, We can all rejoice in the unity of life, and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred caveLet's find a way to join the danceThank youI'd like to talk about my dadMy dad has Alzheimer's diseaseHe started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005Now he's really pretty sickHe needs help eatingHe needs help getting dressedHe doesn't really know where he is or when it isAnd it's been really, really hardMy dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life, and I've spent the last decade watching him disappearMy dad's not aloneThere's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementiaAnd by 2030, they're expecting that to double to 70 millionThat's a lot of peopleDementious cares usThe confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia, the big numbers of people who get itThey frighten us and because of that fear, we tend to do one or two thingsWe go into denialIt's not meIt has nothing to do with meIt's never going to happen to meOr we decide that we're going to prevent dementiaAnd it will never happen to us because we are going to do everything right and it won't come and get usI'm looking for a third wayI'm preparing to get Alzheimer's diseasePrevention is goodAnd I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer'sI'm eating rightI'm exercising every dayI'm keeping my mind activeThat's what the research says you should doBut the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100% protect youIf the monster wants you, the monster's going to get youThat's what happened with my dadMy dad was a bilingual college professorHis hobbies were chess, bridge, and writing op-edsHe got dementia anywayIf the monster wants to, the monster's gonna get you, especially if you're me, because Alzheimer's tends to ruin in familiesSo I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's diseaseBased on what I've learned from taking care of my father and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparationI'm changing what I do for funI'm working to build my physical strength And this is the hard oneI'm trying to become a better personLet's start with the hobbiesWhen you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourselfYou can't sit and have long talks with your old friends because you don't know who they areIt's confusing to watch television and often very frighteningAnd reading is just about impossibleWhen you care for someone with dementia and you get training, they train you to engage them activities that are familiar, hands on, open-endedWith my dad that turned out to be letting him fill out formsHe was a college professor at a state schoolHe knows what paperwork looks likeHe'll sign his name on every lineHe'll check all the boxesHe'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbersBut it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me? I'm my father's daughterI read, I write, I think about global health a lotWould they give me academic journals, so I could scribble in the margins? Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color? So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-onI've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more, even though I'm really very bad at itI am learning some basic origamiI can make a really great boxI'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blobBut, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at itWhat matters is that my hands know how to do itBecause the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do, the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymoreThey say that people who are engaged in activities are happier, easier for their caregivers to look after, it may even slow the progress of the diseasebut all seems like win to meI want to be as happy as I can for as long as I canA lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms as well as cognitive symptomsYou lose your sense of balanceYou get muscle tremorsAnd that tends to lead people to being less and less mobileThey get scared to walk aroundThey get scared to moveSo I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balanceI'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance that when I start to lose it, I'll still be able to be mobileI'm doing weight-bearing exercise so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move aroundFinally, the third thingI'm trying to become a better personMy dad was kind of loving before he had Alzheimer's and he's kind of loving nowI've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skillsBut I've also seen thisHe loves me, he loves my sons, he loves my brother and my mom and his caregiversAnd that love makes us want to be around him, even now, even when it's so hardWhen you take away everything that he ever learned in this world, his naked heart still shinesI was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as lovingAnd what I need now is to learn to be like thatI need a heart so pure, that if it's stripped bare by dementia, It will surviveI don't want to get Alzheimer's diseaseWhat I want is a cure in the next 20 years soon enough to protect meBut if it comes to me, I'm going to be readyThank youThank youI was speaking to a group of about 300 kids, ages six to eight at a children's museum, and I brought with me a bag full of legs, similar to the kinds of things you see up here, and had them laid out on a table for the kidsAnd for my experience, kids are naturally curious about what they don't know, we don't understand or is far into themThey only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way and maybe sensors that natural curiosity or you know, reins in the question asking for the in the hopes of them being polite little kidsSo I mean I could just picture the first great teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids saying now whatever you do, don't stare at her legsAnd of course that's the pointThat's why I was thereI want to invite them to look and exploreSo I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their ownSo the doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs, and they are poking and prodding and they're wiggling toes and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with thatAnd I said, kids, really quicklyI woke up this morningI decided I wanted to be able to jump over a houseNothing too big, two or three storiesBut if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character, anything you can dream up right now, What kind of legs would you build me? And immediately, a voice shouted, can you, no, no, no, she'd be a frog, no, it should be go-go gadget, no, no, no, it should be the incredibles and other things that I don't aren't familiar withAnd then when eight-year-old said, hey, why wouldn't you want to fly to? And the whole room, including me, was like, yeahAnd just like that, I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as disabled, to somebody who had potential that their bodies didn't have yetSomebody that might even be super ableInterestingThe sum of you actually saw me a TED 11 years agoAnd there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees and I am no exceptionTed literally was a launch pad to the next decade of my life's explorationAt the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prostheticsI had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs, wanted out of the hand leg of a cheetah, which you may have seen on stage yesterdayAnd also these very lifelike and intrinsically painted silicon legsSo at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out of innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legsSo that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function, and aesthetic, and assigning them different valuesWe're lucky for meA lot of people answered that callAnd the journey started funny enough with a Ted conference attendeeShe Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere todayShe was the editor And then I'm a magazine called ID, and she gave me a cover storyThis started an incredible journeyCurious encounters were happening at the timeI've been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the Cheeto Legs around the worldAnd people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk, men and womenAnd the conversation would go something like thisYou know Amy, you're very attractiveYou don't look disabledI thought, well, that's amazing, because I don't feel the same holdsAnd it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored about beautyWhat does a beautiful woman have to look like? What does a sexy body? And interestingly, from an identity standpoint, what does it mean to have a disability? I mean, people Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I doNobody calls her disabledSo, so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer Peter Stavl went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen and photographer Nick Knight who were also interested in exploring that conversationSo, three months after Ted, I found myself on a plane to London doing my first fashion shoot, resulted in this cover, fashion, ableThree months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexandria McQueen on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash, nobody knew, everyone thought they were wooden bootsActually I have them on stage with meGreat vines, my nollias, truly stunningPoetry mattersPoetry is what It elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of artIt can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look and look a little longer and maybe even understandI learned this firsthand with my next adventure, the artist, Matthew Barney, and his film opus called the creamaster cycleThis is where it really hit home for me that my legs could be wearable sculptureAnd even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate humanness as the only aesthetic idealSo we made what people lovingly refer to as glass legs, even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane, aka bowling ball materialThen we made these legs that are cast in soil with potato root system growing in them and beat roots at the top and I'm very lovely brass toeIt's a good close of that oneThen another character was a half woman, half chida, little homage to my life as an athlete14 hours of prosthetic makeup to get into a creature that had articulated paws, claws, and the tail that whipped around like a geckoAnd then another pair of legs, we collaborated on with theselook like jellyfish legs, also polyurethaneAnd the only purpose of these legs can serve outside the context of the film is to provoke the senses and ignite the imaginationSo whimsy mattersToday, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for meAnd with them, I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feetAnd I can change my heightI have a variable of five different heightsToday I'm 61And I had these legs made a little over a year ago and a doorstep or the pedic in EnglandAnd when I brought them home to Manhattan, my first night out in the town, I went to a very fancy partyAnd a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal 58Her mouth dropped open when she saw me and she went, but you're so tallAnd I said I knew it wasn't it funI mean, it's a little bit like wearing stillton stillt, But I have an entirely new relationship to Dorjame that I never expected I would ever haveAnd I was having fun with itAnd she looked at me and she said, but Amy, that's not fairAnd the incredible thing was she really meant itIt's not fair that you can change your height as you want itAnd that's when I knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decadeIt is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiencyIt's a conversation about augmentationIt's a conversation about potentialA prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymoreIt can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that spaceSo people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowermentAnd what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting edge technology, robotics, bionics, with the age-old poetryWe are moving closer to understanding our collective humanityI think that if we wanted to discover the full potential in our humanity, we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all haveI think of Shakespeare ShilockIf you prick us, do we not bleed? And if you tickle us, do we not laugh? It is our humanity and all the potential within it that makes us beautifulThank youThank youI'll now have been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth senseA sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to metal information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever this ever coming acrossAnd some of you may argue, well, don't today's cell phones do that alreadyBut I would say noWhen you meet someone here at TED and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year, you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you? Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, You don't take out your cellphone and open a browser and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to makeSo we don't really have easy access to all these relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to takeSo my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way without requiring that the user changes any of their behaviorAnd I'm here to unveil our latest effort and most successful efforts so far, which is still very much a work in process, actually wearing the device right now And we sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf and that by the way, only cost $350 at this point in timeI'm wearing a camera, just a simple webcam, a portable battery powered rejection system with a little mirrorThese components communicate to my self-only my pocket, which acts as the communication and computation deviceAnd in the video here, we see my student Pranath mystery who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole systemAnd we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of himThe system tracks the four significance fingers, in this case, he's wearing simple marker caps, and then you may recognizeBut if you want a more stylish version, you could also paint your nails in different colorsAnd the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's makingSo he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, Zoom in and out, et ceteraThe system also recognizes iconic gestures, such as the take picture gesture and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of youAnd when he then walks back to the media lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them and resize them etcAgain using all natural gesturesSo some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by the Jeff Han or some of you may think, well, it doesn't just look like the Microsoft Surface tableAnd yes, you also interact using natural gestures, both hands, et ceteraBut the difference here is that you can use any surfaceYou can walk up to any surface, including your hand, if nothing else is availableAnd interact with this project data, the device is completely portable and can be nodesSo one important difference is that it's totally mobileAnother important difference is that in mass production, this would not cost more tomorrow then today's cellphones and would actually not sort of be a bigger package and could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neckBut other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in minority report, The reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these six sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of youSo we see Pranath here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels and as he picks up a product, the system can recognize the product that he's picking up using either image recognition or marker technology and give him the green light or an orange light, he can ask for additional informationSo this particular choice here is a particularly good choice given his personal criteriaSome of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleaching it rather than the most psychologically responsible choiceBut if he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating, gets projected right on the cover of the bookThis is Huan's book, our previous speaker, which gets a great rating by the way, a AmazonAnd so, Pranath turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about notebook, reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, et ceteraIf he turns to a particular page, he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular pageReading the newspaper, it never has to be outdatedYou can get video annotations of events that you're reading aboutYou can get a latest sports course, et ceteraThis is a more controversial oneAs you interact with someone at a test, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pagesIn this case, the student is interested in cameras, et ceteraon your way to the airport, if you pick out your boarding pass, you can tell you that your flight is delayed, that the gate has changed, etcAnd if you need to know what the current time is, it's a simplest drawing a watch on your armSo that's where we're at so far in developing this six cents sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we make come acrossMy student Pronalf who's really like I said, the genius behind thisHe does deserve a lot of applause because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months actually and his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him eitherBut it's not perfect yet, it's very much a working progress and who knows maybe in another ten years will be here with the ultimate six-cent brain implantThank youThank youI wrote letters last week talking about the work of the foundations, sharing some of the problems, and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that, being honest about what was going well, what wasn't, and making it kind of an annual thingA goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think There are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturallyThat is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right thingsAnd only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need toSo this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they standBut before I dive into those, I want to admit that I am an optimistAny top problem I think it can be solvedAnd part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century, average lifespan is more than doubledAnother statistic, perhaps my favorite, is to look at childhood deathsAs recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of fiveFive years ago, 135 million children were born, so more, and less than 10 million of them died before the age of fiveSo that's a factor of two reduction in the childhood death rateIt's a phenomenal thingI mean, each one of those lives matters a lotAnd the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising in comes, but also a few key breakthroughs, vaccines that were used more widelyFor example, measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000So we really can make changesThe next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half againAnd I think that's doable in well under 20 yearsWhy? Well, there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malariaAnd so that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning, which is, how do we stop a disease, a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes? What's the history of this disease? It's been a severe disease for thousands of yearsIn fact, we look at the genetic codeIt's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malaria deathsThat's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930sSo it was absolutely giganticAnd the disease was all over the worldTerrible diseaseIt was in the United Stateswas in EuropePeople didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoesSo it was everywhereAnd two tools helped bring the death rate downOne was killing the mosquitoes with DDTAnd the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivativesAnd so that's why the death rate did come downNow ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where all the rich countries areSo we can see 1900 it's everywhere, 1945 it's still most places1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it1990 you've gotten most in northern areasAnd then more recently you can see it's just around the equatorAnd so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries, it doesn't get much investmentFor example, there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malariaNow, baldness is terrible thingAnd rich men are afflictedAnd so that's why that priority has been setBut malaria, even the million deaths of your caused by malaria, greatly understate its impactOver 200 million people at any one time or suffering from it, means that you can't get the economies in these areas going, because there's just, it holds things back so muchNow, malarists, of course, transmit a bite mosquitoesI brought some here, so you could experience thisWe'll let those roam around the, out of Torem a little bit thereThere's no reason only poor people should have the experienceNot those mosquitoes are not infected, butSo we've come up with a few new thingsWe've got bednets and bednets are a great toolis the mother and child stand at the bed net at nightAnd so the mosquitoes that bite lead at night can't get at themAnd when you use indoor sprain with DDT and those nets, you can cut deaths by over 50%And that's happened now in a number of countriesIt's great to seeBut we have to be careful because malaria, the parasite evolves, and the mosquito evolvesSo every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffectiveAnd so you end up with two choicesIf you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously, you can actually get a local eradicationAnd that's where we saw the malaria map shrinkingOr if you go in kind of half-heartedly, for a period of time, you'll reduce the disease burdenBut eventually, those tools will be coming effective and the death rate will soar back up againAnd the world has gone through this, where it paid attention and then didn't pay attentionNow we're on the up screenBednet funding is upThere's new drug discovery going onOur foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple monthsAnd that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effectiveAnd so we're going to have these new toolsBut that alone doesn't give us the roadmapBecause the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many thingsIt involves communicators to keep the funding hide, to keep the visibility hide, to tell the success storiesIt involves social scientistsSo we know how to get not just 70% of people who use the bad nets, but 90%We need mathematicians to come and assimilate this, to monitor all the things, to understand how these tools combine and work togetherOf course, we need drug companies to give us their expertiseWe need ritual governments to be very generous in providing aid for these thingsAnd so as these elements come together, I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malariaWell, now let me turn to a second questionA fairly different question, but I'd say equally importantAnd this is how do you make a teacher great? Now, seems like the kind of question that people had spend a lot of time on and that we understand very wellAnd the answer is really that we don'tLet's start with why this is importantWell, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachersWe all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today, part of the reason we're successfulI can say that, even though I'm a college dropoutI had great teachersAnd in fact, in the United States, the teaching system is worked fairly wellThere are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of placesSo the top 20% of students have gotten a good educationAnd those top 20% have been the best in the world, if you measure them against the other top 20%And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the USat the forefrontNow, the strength for those top 20% is starting to fade on a relative basis, but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are gettingNot only has that been weak, it's getting weakerAnd if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better educationAnd so we have to change thisWe have to change it so that people have equal opportunityWe have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront to things that are driven by advanced education, like science and mathematicsWhen I first learned the statistics, I was pretty stunned at how bad things areOver 30% of kids never finished high schoolAnd that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before thatBut most of the dropouts that take place before that and so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percentFrom an orty kids, it's over 50 percentAnd even if you graduate from high school, if you're low income, you have less than of 25% chance of ever completing a college degreeIf you're low income in the United States, you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degreeAnd that doesn't seem entirely fairSo how do you make education better? Our foundation for the last nine years is invested in thisThere's many people working on itWe've worked on small schoolsWe funded scholarshipsWe've done things in librariesA lot of these things had a good effectBut the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thingAnd so we looked up with some people studying, how much variation is there between teachers? Between, say, the top quartile, the very best and the bottom quartileHow much variation is there within a school or between schools? And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievableA top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single yearWhat does that mean? Well, that means that the entire US for two years had top quartile teachers, the entire difference between us and Asia would go awayAnd within four years, we would be blowing everyone in the world awaySo it's simpleAll you need is those top quartile teachersAnd so you'd say, wow, that's goodWe should reward those peopleWe should retain those peopleWe should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other peopleBut I can tell you that absolutely is not happening todayWhat are the characteristics of this top quartile? What do they look like? You might think, well, these must be very senior teachersAnd the answer is noOne, somebody is taught for three yearsTheir teaching quality does not change thereafterThe variation is very, very smallYou might think, well, these are people with masters degreesThey've gone back and they've gotten their masters of educationThis chart takes four different factors and says, how much do they explain teaching quality? Bottom things, which says there's no effect at all, is a master's degreeNow, the way the P system works is there's two things that are rewardedOne is seniority, because your pay goes up and you've asked in your pensionAnd the second is giving extra money to people to get their master's degreeBut in no way is associated with being a better teacherTeach for America a slight effectFor math teachers, majoring in math is a measurable In fact, but overwhelmingly, it's your past performanceThere are some people who are very good at thisAnd we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in, to replicate it, to raise the average capability, or to encourage the people with it to stay in the systemYou might say, well, do the good teachers stay in the bad to retrieveThe answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnoverNow, there are a few places, very few, where great teachers are being madeGood example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPKIP means knowledge is powerIt's an unbelievable thingThey have 66 schools, mostly middle schools, seven high schools, and what goes on is great teachingThey take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year collegesAnd the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schoolTheir team teaching, they're constantly improving their teachersThey're taking data, the test scores, and saying to a teacher, hey, you caused this amount of increaseAnd so they're deeply engaged in making teaching betterWhen you actually go and sit one of these classrooms at first, it's very bizarreI sat down and I thought, what is going on? The teacher was running around and the energy levels highI thought, well, I'm in the prep, the sports rally, or somethingWhat's going on? And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention, which kids were boredAnd calling on kids rapidly, putting things up on the boardIt was a very dynamic environmentBecause particularly in those middle school years, fifth or eighth grade, keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attentionNobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of, you know, the kid who doesn't want to be there, everybody needs to be involvedAnd so Kip is doing itHow does that compare to a normal school? Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they areThe data isn't gatheredIn the teachers' contract, it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom, sometimes to once per yearAnd they need advanced notice to do thatSo imagine running a factory where you've got these workers, some of them just making crapAnd the management is told, hey, you can only come down here once a year, but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good jobthat one brief momentEven a teacher wants to improve, doesn't have the tools to do itThey don't have the test scoresAnd there's a whole thing of trying to block the data, for example, New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachersAnd so that's sort of working in the opposite directionsBut I'm optimistic about thisI think there's some clear things we can doFirst of all, there's a lot more testing going on, and that's given us the picture of where we areAnd that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques areOf course, digital video is cheap nowPutting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis that is very practical in all public schoolsAnd so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say, okay, here's a little clip of something I thought I did wellHere's a little clip of something I think I did poorlyAdvise me when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that? And they can all sit and work together on those problemsYou can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it, have itSo everyone sees who is the very best teaching this stuffYou can take those great courses to make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from thatIf you have a kid who's behind, you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the conceptAnd in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the internet, but you could make it so that DVDs were always availableAnd so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachersAnd so by thinking of this as a personnel system, we can do it much betterThere's a book actually about the place that this is going on that Jane Matthews, a news reporter called Work Hard Be NiceAnd I thought it was so fantasticGive you a sense of what a good teacher doesI'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this bookNow, we put a lot of money in dedicationAnd I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should haveIn fact, we have an stimulus bill, it's interesting that house version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because there are people threatened by these things, but I'm optimisticI think people are beginning to recognize how important this is, and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it rightWhy only had times to frame those two problems? There's a lot more problems like that, AIDS, pneumonia, and just see or get him excited just at the very name of these thingsAnd the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broadThe system doesn't naturally make it happenGovernments don't naturally pick these things in the right wayThe private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these thingsSo it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things, get other people involved, and you're helping to come up with solutionsAnd with that, I think there's some great things will come out of itThank youGreat creativity in time of needWe need great creativity, discussGreat creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerfulGreat creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom, make education seem like a bright ideaGreat creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation, or show that deprivation ain't necessarily soGreat creativity can make politicians, electable, or parties unelectableIt can make war seem like tragedy or fastCreativity is the meme maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lipsIt's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral mazeScience is clever, but great creativity is something less noble, more magicalAnd now we need that magicThis is a time of needOur climate is changing quickly, too quicklyAnd great creativity is needed to do what it does so well, to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements, to tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scrapsHere is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greenerYou know, rather than drive today, I'm gonna walk and sow you walkAnd as he walk, he's often strange and wonderful thingsHe would not otherwise have seen a deer with an itchy leg, a flying motor specA father-in-dark separated from a bicycle by the mysterious wallAnd then he stoppedWalking in front of him was herThe woman who has a child that skid with him through fields and broken his heartSure, she'd age the littleIn fact, she'd age a lot, but he felt all his old passion for her returnFord, he called softlyThat was her nameDon't say another word, Gusti, she said, but that was his nameI know it's 10 next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from hereLet's go thereMake lovein the tent, for it on dressShe spread one leg and then the otherGosty, enter her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him because she was a keen amateur pornographerThe Earth moved for both of them and they lived together happily ever after and all because he decided to walk that dayWe've got the science we've had the debate, the moral imperative is on the tableGreat creativity is needed to take it all, make it simple and sharp, to make it connect, to make it make people want to actSo this is a call, a plea to the incredibly talented Ted communityLet's get creative against climate change, and let's do it soonThank youAPPLAUSEI would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit and showing you some of the designs that we have in natureAnd so I have my first slide to talk about the donning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation that is looking at the relics of creation and ensuring what happened at the beginning and then following it up and trying to understand itAnd so one of the questions that I asked you is when you look around what do you see? Well, you see this space that's created by designers and by the work of peopleBut what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here of being reshaped on a certain formAnd so the question is, how did that material get here? How did it get into the form you had before? It got reshaped and so forthIt's a question of what's the continuity? So one of the things I look at is, how did the universe begin and shape what was the whole process and the creation and the evolution of the universe? to the getting to the point that we have these kind of materialsSo that's sort of part, and let me move on, then show you the Hubble Ultra-D fieldAs you look in this picture, what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in itAnd everything, but four of these light objects are stars, and you can see them there little plusesThis is a starThis is a starEverything else is a galaxySo there's a couple of thousand galaxiesYou can see easily with your eye in hereAnd when I look out, it particularly this galaxy which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's an art design college conference going onAnd it tells me things there are thinking about, what designs I might doAnd there might be a few, because I'm all just trying to understand where the universe itself came fromAnd there might even be some on that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what's going on over hereBut there's a lot of other galaxies and some are nearby and they're kind of the color of the sun and some are further away and they're a little blue and so forthBut one of the questions is, this should be to you, how come there's so many galaxies? Because this represents a very teeny fraction of the skyThis is only a thousand galaxiesWe think there's on the order visible to the Hubble say telescope if you have the time of the scan and around about 100 billion galaxiesIt's a very large number of galaxiesAnd that's roughly how many stars there are on our own galaxyBut when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see more galaxies and stars, which is kind of a conundrumSo the question should come to your mind is what kind of design, what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like thatAnd then I'm going to tell you, it's actually a lot more complicatedWe're going to try and follow it upWe have a tool that actually helps us out in the studyAnd that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine in a certain senseWe draw this set of nested spheres cut awaySo you can see it put the earth at the center of the nested spheres, just because that's for making observationsAnd the moon is only two seconds awaySo if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light, this is the moon two seconds ago, and who cares? Two seconds is like the presentThe sun is eight minutes agoThat's not such a big deal, unless it's all our flares comingYou want to go the other wayYou'd like to have the advance morningBut you get out to Jupiter in its 40 minutes awayIt's a problemYou hear about MarsIt's a problemYou communicate with Mars because it takes light long enough to go thereBut if you look out to the nearest set of stars, so the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 yearsto pick and take a picture what's going on, it's 10 years agoBut you go and look to the center of the galaxy is thousands of years agoYou look at end drama, which is the nearest big galaxyAnd it's two million years agoIf you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago, there'd be no evidence of humans at all because we don't think they were humans yetI mean, it just gives you the scaleAnd with Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to billion yearsBut if we were capable to come up with an idea how to look even further to since things even further And that was what I did a lot of my work was to develop the techniquesAnd we could look out back to even earlier effects before there were stars and before there were galaxies back to when the universe was hot and dense and very differentAnd so that's the sort of sequenceAnd so I have a more artistic impression of thisThere's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way and around it are the Hubble nearby kind of galaxiesAnd there's a sphere that marks the different timesAnd behind that are some more modern galaxiesYou see the whole big pictureSo beginning of time is funny, it's on the outsideAnd then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot, light can't escapeIt's like you can't see the center of the sunYou have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the sunBut you can see the edge of the sun, and the universe gets that wayAnd you can see thatAnd then you see this sort of model area around the outsideAnd that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang, which is actually incredibly uniformThe universe is almost a perfect sphere, but there are these very tiny variations, which we show here in great exaggerationAnd from them in the time sequence, we're gonna have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars, to these more advanced galaxies and eventually this solar system, so forthSo it's a big design job, but we'll see how things are going onSo the way this measurements were done has been to set a satellite, and this is where you get to seeSo there was the Kobe satellite, which was launched in 1989, And we discovered these variationsAnd then in 2000, the map satellite was launched, the W map, and it made somewhat better picturesAnd later this year, this is the cool stealth version, the one that actually has some beautiful design features to itAnd it's the planks satellite will be launched, and it will make very high-rolls-efficient mapsAnd that will be the sequence of understanding in the very beginning of the universeAnd what we saw was we sound these variations, and then they told us the secrets, both about the structure of space time and about the content of the universe and about how the universe started in its original motionsSo we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture, and I'll come back to it at the beginning, where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning, and we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe expands and cools, and until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent, then the dark ages, and then the first stars turn on, and they evolve into galaxies, and the later they get to the more expensive galaxiesAnd somewhere around this period is when there are some systems start disforming and it's maturing up to the present timeAnd there's some spectacular things and this waste basket part, that's the represent what the structure of space time itself is doing during this periodAnd so this is a pretty weird model, right? What kind of evidence do we have for that? So let me show you some of nature's patterns that are results of thisI always think of space time as being the real substance space and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the oceanIt's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever we're notSo here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxiesSo there's dot on here for every galaxyThey go out and point it up to the sky, take a picture, identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies, estimate how far away they are and plot them upAnd just put radially they're going out that wayAnd you see these structures, this thing, we call the Great Wall, and what there are voids, and those kind of stuffAnd they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do itNow I'm going to show you this in 3DWhat happens is you take pictures as the Earth rotates, you get a plan across the skyThere's some places you can't look because of our own galaxy or because there are no telescopes available to do itSo the next picture shows you the three dimensional version of this, rotating aroundYou see the fan like scans made across the skyRemember, every spot on here is a galaxyAnd you see the galaxies, sort of, in our neighborhoodAnd you sort of see this structureAnd you see this thing we call the Great WallAnd you see the complicated structureAnd you see these voidsThey're places where there are no galaxies and they're places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped togetherSo there's an interesting patternBut we don't have enough data here to actually see the patternWe only have a million galaxiesSo keeping like a million balls on the airbut what's going on? So there's another survey which is very similar to this, called the 2-degree field of view, Galaxy Redshift surveyNow we're going to fly through it at warp a millionAnd every time there's a galaxy at its location, there's a galaxy, and we know if we know anything about the galaxy, which you do, because there's a redshift measurement, everythingYou put in the type of galaxy in the colorSo this is the real representationAnd when you're in the middle of the galaxy, it's hard to see the patternIt's like being in the middle of lifeIt's hard to see the patternmiddle of the audience, it's hard to see the pattern of thisSo we're going to go out and swing around and look back at thisAnd you'll see the first structure of the survey, then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out thereSo again, you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up hereBut you can see the voids, you can see the complicated structure And you say, well, how did this happen? Suppose you're the cosmic designer, how are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that? It's not just throwing them out at randomThere's a more complicated process going on hereHow are you going to end up doing that? And so now we're in for some serious play that as we have to seriously play God, not just change people's lies, but make the universeSo if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that? What's the kind of technique, what's the kind of thing you're going to do? So I'm going to show you the results of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like using essentially some of the play principles and some of the design principles that humans have labored so hard to pick up would apparently nature knew how to do at the beginningAnd that is you start out with very simple ingredients and simple rules and what you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicatedAnd then you put in some randomness, some fluctuations, and some randomness, and realize a whole bunch of different representationsSo what I'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales we're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it isAnd we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out, right, with called dark matterThat is matter that doesn't interact with light, the typical way that ordinary matter does, the way the light shining on me or on the stageIt's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it, we're going to make it whiteSo the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter, which should be called invisible matter, the dark matter made visibleAnd then the stuff that is in the yellow color, that is the ordinary kind of matter, is turned into stars and galaxiesSo I'll show you the next movieSo this we're going to zoom inWe'll notice this pattern, and pay attention to this patternWe're going to zoom in and zoom inAnd you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and when a number of filaments come together and do not, that makes a super cluster of galaxiesThis one we're zooming in on is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in a small regionSo we live in the boonies, we don't live in the center of the solar system, we don't live in the center of the galaxy, and our galaxy is not in the center of a big clusterSo we're zooming in, this is a region which probably has more than 100,000 on the order of a million galaxies in that regionWe're going to keep zooming inOkay, and so I forgot to tell you the scaleA parsec is 326 light yearsSo gigaparsecs is 3 billion light yearsThat's the scaleSo it takes light 3 billion years to travel over that distanceNow we're into a distance between here and hereThis is a distance between us and in dramaRight? These little specs that you're seeing hereThey're galaxiesNow we're going to zoom back outoutAnd you can see this structure that we get very far out looks very regularIt's made up of a lot of irregular variationsSo there's simple building blocksThere's a very simple fluid that we begin withIt's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter, it's got photons, and it's got neutrinos which don't play much role in the later part the universeAnd it's just a simple fluid and it, it, it, it, it, over time, develops into this complicated structureAnd so, you know, now, when you first saw this picture, didn't mean quite so much to youHere, you're looking across 1% of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right? And nodesBut you realize they're not even the main structureThere's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter, the South there, that's actually holding it all togetherSo let's slide through it and you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this outSo here's that same end resultYou see a filament, you see the white is the invisible matter and the yellow is the star so the galaxies showing up and we're going to fly around and we'll fly around and you'll see some occasionally a couple of filaments intersect and you get a large cluster of galaxies and then we'll fly in and we're the very large cluster is and you can see what it looks likeAnd so from inside, it doesn't look very complicatedIt's only when you look at it on a really large scale and then explore it and stuff forthYou realize this is a very intricate, complicated kind of a designAnd it's grown up in some kind of waySo the question is, how hard would it be to assemble this? How big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together? That's this issueAnd so here we areYou see how several elements are coming together and therefore making this super cluster of galaxiesAnd you have to understand, this is not how it actually look if you were, first you can't travel this fast, but everything will be distortedBut so this is using simple renderingGraphic art, it's kind of stuffThis is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to youif you could see in this a little matter tooAnd so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe in a very simple way, we're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe, everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments was once an region that was smaller than an atomIt started with tiny quantum mechanics fluctuations, but expanding an instrument is right And those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizesAnd those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the causing microwave backgroundAnd then we need some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and to make these kind of structures go onSo I'm going to show you a smaller simulationThis simulation was run on a thousand processors for a month in order to make just the simple visual oneSo I'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next pictureSo you start out with teeny fluctuations when in the nearest was at this point now four times smallerAnd so forthAnd you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure formingAnd this is a simple one because it doesn't have the ordinary matter, and it just has the dark matter in itAnd you see how the dark matter lumps up and the ordinary matter just trails along behindSo there it isAt the beginning it's very uniformThe fluctuations are apart in 100,000It's a few peaks that are apart in 10,000And then over billions of years, gravity just pulls inThis is light over density, pulls the material around inThat pulls in more material and pulls in more materialBut the distance is on the universe as so large, and the timescale is so large, that it takes a long time for this to formAnd it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now, and in terms of a expansionAnd at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of large scale structureSo we're just seeing as large scale structure as we can seeAnd then the only things that are started forming already are going to form then from then onSo it's going to go onSo we're able to do this simulationBut this is two days on a desktopWe need 30 days on a thousand processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you beforeSo we have an idea of how to play seriously it creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedrope full of material, right? And we create everything we can see in any direction, right? From almost nothing, that is something extremely tiny, extremely smallAnd it is almost perfect, except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part 100,000 level, which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and design that is galaxies and stars and so forthSo we have a model and we can calculate it and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like and that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever wasSo this is what we started with 15 years ago with the Cosmic Backgroundist Laura made the map and the upper right which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations, and actually fluctuations on several scalesYou can kind of see thatSince then, we've had WMAP, which just gives us higher angle resolutionWe see the same large scale structure, but we see additional small scale structureAnd on the bottom right is, if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth, what kind of map we've gotten the Earth, you could have seen, well, you can kind of pick out all major continents, but that's about itBut what we're hoping when we get the plank, we'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the of the Earth there where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth and you can also tell because of the sharp edges and the way things fit togetherThere are some nonlinear processesThere is geology has these effects in which is moving the plates around and so forthYou can see that just from the map aloneWe want to get to the point in our maps of the early universeWe can see whether they are really nonlinear effects that are starting to modify and And it gives a hint about how space time itself was actually created at the beginning momentsSo that's where we are todayAnd that's what I wanted to give you a flavor ofGive you a different view about what the design and whatever everything else looks likeThank youSpeaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassionThe truth of the matter is otherwiseOur holy book, the Quran, consists of 114 chapters and each chapter begins with what we call the best smell of the saying in the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful, or as Sir Richard Burton, not the Richard Burton was made to Elizabeth Taylor, but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature, translates it as in the name of God, the compassionating the compassionateAnd in a saying of the Quran, which for the Muslims is God speaking to humanity, God says to his prophet Muhammad, whom we believe to be the last of our series of prophets, beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham, including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad, said that we have not sent you or Muhammad, except as a Rahma, except as a source of compassion to humanityAnd for us human beings and certainly for us as Muslims, whose mission and whose purpose, in following the path of the Prophet, is to make ourselves as much like the Prophet and the Prophet in one of his saying said, Adorn yourselves with the attributes of GodAnd because God himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassionIn fact, the Quran says that God decreed upon himself compassion, or reigned himself in by compassionTherefore our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion, activators of compassion, actors of compassion, and speakers of compassion, and doers of compassionThat is all well and goodBut why do we go wrong? And what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world? For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual pathIn every religious tradition, there is what you call the outer path and the inner path, or the exoteric path and the exoteric pathThe esoteric path of Islam is more popular in known as Sufism, or Tasawwaf in ArabicAnd these doctors, or these masters, these spiritual masters, of the Sufi tradition, refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lieIn one of the battles that the Prophet waged, he told his followers, we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war, to the greater battleAnd they said, messenger of God, we are battle wearyHow can we go to a greater battle? Because that is the battle of the Self, the battle of the egoThe sources of human problems have to do with egoatismI, the famous Sufi Master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you, has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and knocks on the door the voice answers, who's there? It's me, or more grammatically correctly, it is I, as we might say in EnglishThe voice says, go awayAfter many years of training, of discipline, of search and struggle, he comes back and with much greater humility, he knocks again on the doorThe voice asks, who is there? It is you, oh, hotbreakerThe door swings open, and the voice says, Come in, for there is no room in this house for two eyes, two capital eyes, not these eyes, the, for two egosAnd roomless stories are metaphors for the spiritual pathIn the presence of God, there is no room for more than one eye, and that is the eye of divinityIn a teaching, what is called a Hadith Qutzi in our tradition, God says, that my servant, or my creature, my human creature, There's not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to doAnd those of you who are employers know exactly what I meanYou want your employees to do what you ask them to doAnd if they've done that, then they can do extraBut don't ignore what you've asked them to doGod says, my seven continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what I've asked them to do, extra credit with my qualityUntil I love him or love herAnd when I love my seven God says, I become the eyes by which he or she sees the ears by which he or she listens, a hand by which he or she grasps, and the foot by which he or she walks and the heart by which he or she understandsIt is this merging of ourselves with divinity, that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditionsMuslims regard Jesus as the master of SufismThe greatest prophet in Messenger who came to emphasize this spiritual pathWhen he says, I am the spirit and I am the wayWhen the prophet Muhammad said, whoever has seen me has seen God, it is because they became so much an instrument of GodThey became part of God's steam so that God's will was manifested through them and not acting from their own self, from their own egoCompassion on earth is givenIt is in usAll we have to do is to get out egos out of the wayGet out ego-tism out of the wayI'm sure, probably all of you here, of certainly the very vast majority of you, have had what you might call a spiritual experience, a moment in your lives, when for a few seconds a minute perhaps the boundaries of your ego dissolvedAnd at that minute, you felt at one with the universeOne with that jug of water, one with every human being, one with the creator, and you felt in the presence of power, of all, of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassionate mercy that you have ever experienced in your livesThat is a moment which is a gift of God to usA gift when for a moment he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on I, I, me, me, meAnd instead, like the person in the room is story, we say, oh, this is all youThis is all youAnd this is all usAnd us and I and us are all part of youAll CreatorAll the objective, the source of our being, and the end of our journeyYou are also the breaker of our heartsYou are the one whom we should all be towardsFor who's purpose we live, and for who's purpose we shall die, and for who's purpose we shall be resurrected again, to account to God, to what extent we have been compassionate beingsOur message today, and our purpose today, And those of us of you who are here today, and the purpose of this chart of compassion is to remind for the Quran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human beingWe know it allWe have access to it allYoung may have called it the subconsciousThrough our subconscious, in your dreams, which we call, or uncolored, our state of sleep, the lesser death, the temporary deathIn our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions, we travel even outside of our bodies for many of usAnd we see wonderful thingsWe travel beyond the limitations of spaces we know it and beyond the limitations of time as we know itBut all this is for us to glorify the name of the Creator, whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionateGod, Bach, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om, whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity is the locus of absolute being, absolute love and mercy and compassion, an absolute knowledge and wisdom, what Hindus call sat-shitananda, the language differs but the objective is the sameRumi has another story about three a Turk and Arab and I forget the third person but for my sake it could be a meleeOne is asking for anger, one is saying Englishman, one is asking for an Arab and one is asking for grapes and they go have a fight and an argument because I want grapes, I want an Arab, I want not knowing that the word that they're using refers to the same reality in different languagesThere's only one absolute reality by definitionOne absolute being by definition, because absolute is by definition single and absolute and singularThere's this absolute concentration of being, the absolute concentration of consciousness, awareness, and absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinityAnd that should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be humanFor what defines humanity, perhaps biologically, is our physiologyBut God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our natureIn the Quran says, He speaks to the angel and says, when I have finished the formation of Adam from clay and breathed into Him of my spirit, and fall in frustration to himThe angels prostrate not before the human body, but before the human soul, why? Because the soul, the human soul embodies a piece of the divine breath, a piece of the divine soulThis is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine imageWhat is the imagery of God? The imagery of God is absolute being, absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and loveand therefore for us to be humanIn the greatest sense of what it means to be human, in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human, means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within usAnd to seek to perfect within ourselves, the attribute of being, of being alive, of beingness, the atrpt of wisdom of consciousness, of awareness, and the atrbit of being compassionate and loving beingsThis is what I understand from my faith traditionAnd this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditionsAnd this is the common platform on which we must all standAnd when we stand on this platform as such, I am convinced that we can make a wonderful worldAnd I believe personally, that we are on the verge, and that with the presence and help of people like you here, we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah, where he fought hold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plushes and will not learn war and make war any moreWe have reached a stage in human history that we have no optionWe mustWe mustlower our egos, control our egos, whether it is individual ego, personal ego, family ego, national egoAnd that all be for the glorification of the oneThank you and God bless youA human child is born and for quite a long time, it is a consumerIt cannot be consciously a contributorIt is helpless, it doesn't know you and how to surviveEven though it is endowed with an instinct to survive, it needs the help of mother or your foster mother to surviveIt can't afford to doubt the person who tends the childIt has to totally surrender as one surrenders to an anesthesiologistIt has to totally surrenderThat implies a lot of trustThat implies the trusted person won't violate the trustBecause the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trustIt doesn't know even the word violationTherefore it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve, They've birdless self-playedAs the child grows to become an adult, so far it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributeOne cannot contribute unless one feels secureOne feels bigOne feels I am, I have enoughTo be compassionate is not a jokeIt's not that simpleOne One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself, that bigness should be centered on oneself, not in terms of money, not in terms of power you wield, not in terms of any status that you can command in the societyWhat it should be sent at on oneself, the self you are self aware, on that self it should be sent at a bigness, a wholeness, otherwise compassion is just a word and a dreamYou can be compassionate occasionallyMore moved by empathy than by compassionThank God we are empatheticAnd somebody is in pain, we pick up the pain in a Wimbledon, match, final matchThese two guys fight it outEach one has got two gamesIt can be anybody's gameWhat they have swatted so far as no meaningOne person winsThe tennis etiquette is both the players have to come to the net and shakansThe winner boxes the air and kisses the ground, throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for itAnd this guy has to come to the net when he comes to the netYou see his whole faith, his face changesIt looks as though he is wishing that he didn't winWhy? YempathThat's human heartNo human heart is denied of that YempathNo religion can demolish that by indoctrinationculture, no nation and nationalism, nothing can touch it because it is empathyAnd that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to peopleYou do something that makes the difference in somebody's life, even wordsEven time, compassion is not defined in one formThere is no Indian compassionThere is no American compassionIt transcends nation, gender, ageWhy because it is there in everybody? It's experienced by people, occasionalAnd this occasional compassion, we are not talking aboutIt will ever remain a occasion, by mandate you cannot make a person compassionateYou can't say, please allow meNow it's something you'll discoverIt's not an actionBut in English language, it is also an actionI will come to it laterSo one has got to discover a certain wholenessI am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experienceIn spite of a very tragic life, one is happy in moments which are very few and far and the one who is happy, even for a slapstick joke, accept himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneselfThat means the whole universe, known things and unknown thingsAll of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourselfThe subject me and the object, the scheme of things, fuse into one's experience, nobody can say, I am denied ofAn experience common to all and sundryexperience, confirms that in spite of all your limitations, all your wants, desires and full-fueling and the credit cards and layoffs and finally, baldness, you can be happythe extension of the logiques that you don't need to fulfill a desire to be happyYou are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to beThere is no choice in thisThat only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you cannot be minus youIt has got to be youYou cannot be a part of wholeness and still be wholeA moment of happiness reveals that reality, that realization, That recognitionMaybe I am the wholeMaybe the Swami is rightMaybe the Swami is rightYou start in new lifeThen everything becomes meaningfulI have no more reasons to blame myselfIf one has to blame oneself, one has got million reasons plus manyBut if I say in spite of my body being limited, if it is black it is not whiteIf it is white it is not blackHe is limited in a which way you look at him, limitedYour knowledge is limited, health is limited, and powers therefore limited, and the cheerfulness is going to be limitedCompassion is going to be limitedEverything is going to be limitlessYou cannot command compassion unless you become limitless and nobody can become limitless, either you are or you are notPeriodAnd there is no way of your being not limitless tooYour own experience reveals, you spite of all limitations, you are the wholeAnd the wholeness is the reality of viewWhen you relate to the world, it is love firstWhen you relate to the world, the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is what we say, allow and itself becomes compassionIf the object that you relate to, you've talks that emotion, then that again transforms into giving, into sharing, you express yourself because you have compassion, to discover compassion, you need to be compassionate, discover the capacity to give and share, you need to be giving and sharingThere is no shortcut, it is like swimming by swimmingYou learn swimming by swimmingYou cannot learn swimming on a full mattress and enter into waterYou learn swimming by swimming, you learn cycling by cyclingYou learn cooking by cooking, having some sympathetic people around youTo eat what do you cook? And therefore what I say, you have to fake it and make itYou need my predecessor, men that you have to act it outYou have to act compassionatelyThere is no verb for compassionWhat you have an adverb for compassion? That's interesting to meYou act compassionatelyBut then how to act compassionately if I don't have compassion, that is where you You fake it and make itThis is the mantra of United States of AmericaYou fake it and make itYou act compassionatelyAs though you have compassion, grind your teethTake all the support systemIf you know how to pray, prayAsk for compassionLet me act compassionateDo itYou will discover compassion and also slowly, a relative compassion and slowly perhaps if you get the right teaching, you will discover, Compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself, which is one endless wholeness and that's what you areThis words, thank you very muchThank youOne of my favourite cartoon characters is SnoopyI love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of lifeSo when I thought about compassion, my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where his lying there and he says, I really understand and I really appreciate how one should love one's neighbor as one loves one's selfThe only trouble is the people next door I can't stand themAnd this in a way is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good ideaWe all, I think, believe in compassionIf you look at all the world religions or the main world religions, you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassionSo in Judaism we have from our Torah that you should love your neighbor as you love yourselfAnd within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hilell who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourselfAnd all the main religions have similar teachingsAnd again, within Judaism, we have a teaching about God who is called the compassionate one, Harachama, after all how could the world exist without God being compassionate? And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God, so we too have to be compassionateBut what does it mean? What is it impact on our everyday life? Sometimes, of course, being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to controlI know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral or when I have been sitting with the bereaved or with people who are dyingAnd I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty, the challenge that is there for the family, for the personAnd I'm touched so that tears come to my eyesAnd yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that things that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen toAnd yet on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion, then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbiAnd these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world, who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war, or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamisI know some people who say, well, you know, there's just so much out there, I can't do anything, I'm not going to even begin to tryAnd there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigueThere are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymoreAnd so they turn off the television and don't watchIn Judaism though, we tend to always say there has to be a little wayYou have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others, but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and to be of help to peopleSo part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tickAnd of course you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit moreAnd there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation, which says that when God created the world, God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justiceBecause after all, God is just, therefore there should be just as throughout the worldAnd then God looked to the future and realized it the world was created, just with justice, the world couldn't existSo God thought, no, I'm going to create the world just with compassionAnd then God looked to the future and realized that in fact, if the world is just filled with compassion, then there would be amyki and chaosThere has to be limits to all thingsThe rubby is described this as being like a king who has a beautiful fragile glass bowlIf you put too much cold water in, it will crashIt will shatterIf you put boiling water in, it will shatterWhat do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the twoAnd so God put both these possibilities into the worldThere is something more though that has to be thereAnd that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world, into actionYou know, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighborsWe actually have to do something about itSo there is also within Judaism this notion of loving kindness that becomes very important, has itAll these three things then have to be melded together the idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us an an an an an an a feeling of what's right about life, what's write about livingWhat you will be doing, social justiceThere has to be a willingness to do good deeds, but not a course at the expense of our own sanityThere's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo thingsAnd balancing them all in the middle is the notion of compassion, which has to be there if you like at our very rootsThis idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God who is ultimately the compassion of oneWhat does this compassion and tale it can tell understanding the pain of the otherBut even more than that it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creationThat understanding that one is part of that creation, that there is a unity that underlies all that we see, all that we hear, all that we feelI call that unity GodAnd that that unity is something that connects all of creationAnd of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of thingsThat something I do here actually does matter in AfricaThat if I use too much of my carbon allowance, it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central or eastern AfricaSo there is a connectivity and I have to understand that as part of the creation, as part of me being made in the image of GodAnd I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needsThis 18-minute business, I find quite fascinatingBecause in Judaism the word, the number 18 in Hebrew letters, stands for life, the word lifeSo in a sense, the 18-minute is a challenging way to say, in life, this is what's important in terms of compassionBut something else as wellActually 18 minutes is important, because of Passoverwhen we have to eat unleavened breadThe rabbi say, what is the difference between dough that's made into bread? And dough that's made into unleavened bread, mutterAnd they say it's 18 minutesBecause that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become 11What does it mean dough becomes 11? It means it gets filled with hot airWhat's mutter, what's unleavened bread? You don't get itsymbolically what the Rabbi say is that at Passover what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air, our pride, our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world and that everything should revolve around usSo we try and get rid of those and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas that are and slavise that make our eyes closed, give us television so we don't see the needs of othersAnd free ourselves from thatAnd that too is a basis for having compassion, for understanding our place in the worldNow there is Judaism, a gorgeous storyof a rich man who sat in synagogue one dayAnd as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermonAnd as he was dozing off, they were reading from the Book of Lviticus in the TorahAnd they were saying that in the ancient times in the Temple in Jerusalem, They hardly priests used to have bread which they used to place into a special table in the temple in JerusalemThe man was asleep, but he heard the words, bread, temple, God, and he woke upHe said, God wants bread! That's it! God wants bread! I know what God wants! And he rushed home, and after the Sabbath he made 12 loads of breadTook them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue, opened the art and said, God, I don't know why you want this bread be here you are, and he put it in the art with the scrolls of the TorahThen he went homeThe cleaner came into the art of synagogueOh God, I'm such troubleGod, children to feed, like wife-sale, God, no money, what can I do? Goes into the synagogue, God, will you please help me? Oh, what's up on the for smell? Goes to the arkHe opens the arkThere's bread! God, you've outsed my peeve! I've outsed my question! Ah, it takes the bread and goes homeMeanwhile, the rich man thinks to himselfI'm in it, he itGod wants breadGod, the one who rules me entire universe wants my breadYou rushes to the synagogueI'd get it out the ark before anybody finds itGoes in thereAnd it's not thereAnd he says, ah, God, you really did want itYou wanted my breadNext week with raisinsThis went on for yearsEvery week, then I would bring bread with raisins with muscles and good things, put it into the arkEvery week, the cleaner would comeGod, you've answered my prayer, can't take the breadTake it homeWent home until a new rabbi cameRabbi's always spoiled thingsRabbi came inand saw what's going onAnd he called to them to his officeAnd he said, you know, this is what's happeningAnd the rich man, oh dear, Cresfallen, you mean God didn't want my bread? And the poor man said, can you mean God didn't answer my please? And the rabbi said, you've misunderstood meYou can misunderstand, totally, he saidOf course, what you are doing, he said, to the rich man, is answering God's plea that we should be compassionateAnd God, he said to the poor man, as answering your plea, that people should be compassionate and giveHe looked at the rich manHe held the rich man's hands, and said, Don't you understand, he said, these are the hands of GodSo that is the way I feel that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionateBut understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world, that I want to try and serve that unityAnd that I can try and do that by understanding I hope trying to understand something of the pain of othersBut understanding that there are limits that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon themthat I have to understand that there are limits to my energy, to the giving I can giveI have to re-evaluate them, try and separate out what the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me so that I can see the world clearlyThen I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of GodAnd so try to bring compassion to life in this worldThis means I'm smilingSo does that? This means mouseCat? Here we have a storyThe start of the story where this means guyAnd that is a ponytail on a passerbyHere's where it happensThese are whenThis is a cassette tapeThe girl puts into her cassette tape playerShe wears it every dayIt's not considered vintageShe just likes certain music to sound a certain wayLook at her postureIt's remarkableThat's because she dancesNow, he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring honestly, geezWhat are my chances? And he could say, oh my GodOr, I heart youI'm laughing out loud, I wanna give you a hug, but he comes up with thatHe tells her, I'd like to hand paint your portrait on a coffee mugHe could have put a crab inside it, add some water, seven different saltsHe means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land, but just panhandle it the oceanHe says, you look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltzAnd the girl goes, whoaSo the guy replies, yeah, I know, I knowI think my heartbeat might be the Morris Code for inappropriate, at least that's how it seemsI'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimesFor swearing awkward silences and very simple rhyme schemes, right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guyI'm a monkeyblowing kisses at a butterflyBut I'm still suggesting you and I should meanFirst, soon, and then a lotI'm thinking the southwest corner of 5042 and it noon tomorrow, but I'll stay until you show upPonytail or notHell, ponytail aloneI don't know what else to tell youI got a pencil you can borrowYou can put it in your phone, but the girl does not bunch, does not smile, does not frownShe just says, no thank you, you know? Thank youHi, I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration, and thank you and having a be specific in genuineAnd the way I got interested in this was I noticed in myself when I was growing up and until about a few years ago that I would want to say thank you to someone I would want to praise and I'd want to take in their praise of me and I'd stop itAnd I asked myself, why? I felt shy, felt embarrassedAnd then my question became, am I the only one who does this side of the game? I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility so I get to see people who are facing life in death with addictionAnd sometimes it comes down to something as simple as their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's a prodigomBut then they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him, but he never told the sun, because he didn't know that his son needed to hear itSo my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need? I know, a gentleman married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, thank you for being the breadwinners, so I could stay home with the kids, but won't askI know woman who's good at this, she wants a week meets with her husband, and says, I really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the houseAnd with the kids, and he goes, and he goes, oh, this is great, this is great, And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that in the friend of my April who I've had since kindergartenShe thanks her children for doing their choresAnd she said, why wouldn't I think it even though they're supposed to do it? So the question is, why was I blocking it? Why were other people blocking it? Why can I say I'll take my stake medium rare I need size six shoes? But I won't say, would you praise me this way? And it's because I'm giving you critical data about meI'm telling you where I'm insecureI'm telling you where I need your helpAnd I'm treating you my inner circle like you're the enemyBecause what can you do with that data? You couldn't neglect me? You could abuse it? Or you could actually meet my need? And I took my bike into the bike storeI love this same bikeAnd they do something called trueing the wheelsThe guy said, you know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much betterI get the same bike backAnd they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half yearsmy bike is like newSo I'm going to challenge all of youI want you to true your wheels, be honest about the praise that you need to hearWhat do you need to hear? Go home to your wife, go ask her what does she need? Go home to your husband, what does he need? Go home and ask those questions and then help the people around youAnd it's simpleAnd why should we care about this? We talk about world peaceHow can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages? I think it starts household by household, under the same roofSo let's make it right in our own backyardNow, I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husband's great mother's friends, daughters, sons, and maybe somebody's never said that to you, but you've done a really, really good jobAnd thank you for being here and just showing up and changing the world with your ideasThank youThank youThe decorative use of wire and southern Africa dates back hundreds of yearsBut modernisation actually bought communication and a whole new material in the form of telephone wireRural to open migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to place hard to come by natural grassesSo here you can see the change from use starting to use contemporary materialsThese pieces date back from the 40s to the late 50sIn the 90s, my interest in passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a sportic camp outside DurbanAnd I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point and started developing really and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design, and the project soon grew from 50-50 rivers in a bar to yearSoon we had of grown the scrapyards what they could provideSo we could hear why I'm in effect to help usAnd we're not only to supply the materials and on bobbins but to produce our callous specificationsAt the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporarySo I developed a whole range around a mass-produced range that obviously fitted in too much high in Dick Hormack that could be exported and also service our local marketWe started experimenting as you can see in terms of shapes, forms, the scale will become very important and it's become our pit project, it's a tassel, it's been running for 12 years and we supply the current shafts and Donna Care And it's kind of greatThis is our group, our main group of weeversThey come on a weekly basis to do itThey all have bank accountsThey've all moved back to the rural area where they came fromIt's a weekly turnaround of productionThis is the community that our energy needs to show you the slide ofAnd that's also modernized todayAnd it's supporting work for 300 weeversAnd the race is a littleThank you very muchThank youI had a fire nine days agoMy archive is 175 filmsMy 16 millimeter negative, all my books, my dad's books, my photographsI had collectedI was a collector major big timeIt's goneI just looked at it and I didn't know what to doI mean, this was, was I my things?

Huh, I'm the only person I have loved Gee, that's swell I guess you're just my fatal attraction, your life cloning Thank youProbably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the 1900sThey were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoesAnd they wrote telegrams back to ManchesterAnd one of them wrote, Situation hopeless, stop, they don't wear shoesAnd the other one wrote, Glorious opportunity they don't have any shoes yetNow, there's a similar situation in the classical music world, because there are some people who think the classical music is dyingAnd there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yetAnd rather than go into statistics and trends and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing and the record companies that are folding, I thought we should do an experiment tonight, an experimentActually, it's not really an experiment because I know the outcomeBut it's like an experimentNow, before we start, I need to do two thingsOne is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child sounds like when he plays the pianoMaybe you have this child at homeHe sounds something like thisI see some of you recognize this childNow if he practices for a year and takes lessons, he's now eight, and he sounds like thisAnd any practice for another year takes lessons now, he's nineAnd any practice for another year takes lessons now, he's tenAnd at that point, they usually give upNow, if he's waited for one more year, you would have heard thisWhat happened? Was not maybe what you thought, which was suddenly became passionate, engaged, involved, got a new teacher, he had a puberty or whatever it isWhat actually happened was those impulses were reducedYou see the first time he was playing with an impulse on every noteAnd the second with impulse every other note, you can see it by looking at my headThe nine-year-old, the nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes, and the ten-year-old on every eight notes, and the eleven-year-old, one impulse on the whole phraseI don't know how I got into this positionI didn't say I'm gonna move my shoulder over, move my bodyYou know, the music pushed me over, which is why I call it one buttock playingI can be the other buttockI can be the other buttockI can be the other buttockYou know, a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing and I was working with the young pianistHe was the president of the corporation in OhioAnd I was working with this young pianistAnd I said, the trouble with you is you're a two buttock playerYou should be a one buttock playerAnd I moved his body like that while he was playingsuddenly the music took off, took flight, there was a gas in the audience when they heard the differenceAnd then I got a letter from this gentlemanHe said, I was so moved, I went back and I transformed my entire company into a one-buttac companyLAUGHTER Now, the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about youThere are 1600 people, I believeMy estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical musicYou, a door classical music, your FM, is always on that classical dialAnd you have CDs in your carAnd you go to the symphony, and your children are playing in some of these, you can't imagine your life without classical musicThat's the first groupIt's quite a small groupThen there's another group, bigger groupThese are the people who don't mind classical musicYou know, you come home from a long day, and you take a glass of wine, and you put your feet up a little, revolve the end of the background, doesn't do any harmThat's the second groupNow comes the third groupThese are the people who never listen to classical musicIt's just simply not part of your lifeYou might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport, but maybe a little bit of a march from IEThen when you come into the hall, then otherwise you'll never hear itThat's probably the largest group of allAnd then there's a very small groupThese are the people who think their tone deafAmazing number of people think their tone deafActually, I hear a lotMy husband is tone deafActually, you cannot be tone deafNobody is tone deafIf you were tone deaf, you couldn't change the gears on your car and a stick-shift carYou couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from RomeAnd the telephone, the telephone, if your mother calls, on their miserable telephone, she calls and says, hello, you're not in a who it isYou know what, Mouchizin? You have a fantastic earEverybody has a fantastic earSo nobody is turned deafBut I tell you what, it doesn't work for me to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and passionate about classical music and those who have no relationship to it at allThe tone deaf people, they're no longer here, but even between those three categories, it's too wide agoSo I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room downstairs and in aspirin and everybody else looking will come to love and understand classical musicSo that's what we're going to doNow, you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to workIf you look at my face, right? It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment, the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreamingImagine if Martin Luther King had said, I have a dream! Of course, I'm not sure there'll be up to itAll right, so I'm going to take a piece of shoppapThis is a beautiful prelude by ChopperSome of you will know itmusic You know what I think probably happened in this room, And when I started you thought how beautiful that soundsI don't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next yearIt's funny, isn't it? It's funny how there's thoughts kind of wafting your head when we're listening to Gassin' MusicAt a birthAnd of course, if pieces long and you've had a long day, you might actually drift offAnd then you're on the companion, we'll dig you in the room and say, wake up, it's cultureAnd then you feel even worseBut has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you, but because of us? Did anybody think, well, I was playing, why is he using so many impulses? If I'd done this with my head, you certainly would have thought itAnd for the rest of your life, every time you hear classical music, you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulsesSo let's see what's really going on hereWe have a BThis is a BThe next note is a CAnd the job of the C is to make the B sadAnd it doesComposes know thatIf they once had music, they just played those two notesBut basically it's just to be with four sarsNow I think we're starting to ANow to GAnd then to FSo we have B-A-G-FAnd if we have B-A-G-F, what do we expect next? Oh, that might have been a flukeLet's try it againOh, the Ted choirAnd you notice, you notice nobody has turned deafHe's like, right, nobody's, you know, every village in Bangladesh and every, you have a language in China, everybody knowsEverybody knows who's expecting thatNow, shop-pand didn't want to reach the E there because what will have happenedIt'll be over like HamletYou remember Hamlet act one scene threeHe finds out that his uncle killed his fatherAnd remember he keeps on going up to his uncle's homeAnd then he backs away and then he goes up to him againAnd almost kills him in the critics, all of whom sitting in the back rowThere they have to have an opinionSo they say Hamlet is a procrastinatorOh, they say Hamlet has an edipus complexNow, the way to play would be over stupidThat's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet, feel you're going mad and the play with him, the play and your ex-girl and the grave because that's in order to delay until act 5, he can kill himIt's the same with the sharp handHe's just about to reach the E and he says, oh, let's better go back up and do it againSo he does it againNow he gets excitedThat's excitingYou don't have to worry about itNow he gets deaf sharp and finally he goes down to EBut it's the wrong chordBecause the The chord is looking for is this oneAnd it says he doesNow we call that a deceptive cadence, because it deceives usI always tell my students, if you have a deceptive cadence, be sure to raise your eyebrows and everybody will knowAll rightSo you get to do even a strong chordNow you try to see againThat chord doesn't workNow you try to see againThat chord doesn't workNow you try to see againI'm going to trace the tricy again, back doesn't workAnd then finally, there's a gentleman in the front row who went, hmm, my badThere's the same gesture he makes me comes home after a long day, turns off the key in his car and says, oh, I'm home, because we all know where home isSo this is a piece which goes from a way to homeAnd I'm going to play it all the way through, and you're going to followBC, BC, BC, BC, down to A, down to G, down to F, almost goes to even otherwise the play would be over, goes back up to be, it's very excited, goes to our shop, goes to ears the wrong chord, it's the wrong chord, it's the wrong chord, and finally goes to E and it's homeAnd what you're gonna see is one buttock playingLAUGHTER Because for me to join the B to the E, I have to stop thinking about every single note along the way and start thinking about the long, long line from B2EYou know, we were just in South Africa, and you can't go to South Africa without thinking of Mandela in jail for 27 yearsWhat was he thinking about lunch? No, he was thinking about the vision for South Africa and for human beingsThat's what, yeah, this is about visionThis is about the long line, like the bird who flies over the field and doesn't care about the fences underneathSo now you're going to follow the line all the way from B2EAnd I've one last request before I play this piece all the way throughWould you think of somebody who you adore, who's no longer there? A beloved grandmother, a lover, somebody in your life, who you love with all your heart, but that person is no longer with youBring that person into your mind, and at the same time, follow the line all the way from B, tea and you'll hear everything that Chopin had to sayyou you I'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousI'm going to be a little bit more nervousNow, you may be wondering, you may be wondering why I'm crafting, well I did this to the school in Boston with about 77th graders, 12-year-olds, and I did exactly what I did with you, and I told them, and explained them the whole thingand at the end they went crazy, clapping, they were clapping, I was clapping, they were clappingFinally I said, why am I clapping? One of these little kids said, because we were listeningThink of it, 1600 people, busy people involved in all sorts of different things, listening, understanding and being moved by a piece by shopperNow that is somethingNow I am I sure that every single person followed that, understood it was moved by, But I can't be sure, but I tell you what happened to meI was in Ireland during the troubles 10 years agoAnd I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids on conflict resolutionAnd I did this with themA risky thing to do, because they were street kidsAnd one of them came to me the next morningAnd he said, you know, I've never listened to classical music in my lifeBut when you played that shopping piece, I said, my brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for himBut last night when you played that piece, he was the one I was thinking aboutAnd I felt the tears streaming down my face and you know it felt really good to cry for my brotherSo I made out my mind at that moment that classical music is for everybodyEverybodyNow how would you walk? Because you know my profession, the music profession doesn't see it that wayThey say 3% of the population likes classical musicIf only we could move it to 4% our problems will be overI say, how would you walk? How would you talk? How would you be if you thought 3% of the population likes classical music? If only we could move it to 4%How would you walk? How would you talk? How would you be if you thought everybody loves classical music? They just haven't found out about it yetSee, these are totally different worldsNow, I had an amazing experienceI was 45 years oldI've been conducting for 20 years, and I'm suddenly had a realizationThe conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a soundMy picture appears on the front of the CDBut the conductor doesn't make a soundHe depends for his power on his ability to make other people powerfulAnd that changed everything for meIt was totally life-changingPeople in my orchestra came out to me and said, Ben, what happened? That's what happenedI realized my job was to awaken possibility in other peopleAnd of course I wanted to know whether I was doing thatAnd you know how you find out, you look at their eyesIf their eyes are shining, you know you're doing itYou could light up a village with this guy's eyesRightSo if the eyes are shining, you know you're doing itIf the eyes are not shiny, you get to ask a question, and this is the question, who am I being? That might play as eyes are not shinyWe can do that with our children tooWho am I being? That my children's eyes are not shinyThat's a totally different worldNow we're all about to end this magical on the mountain week, and we're going back into the worldAnd I say, it's appropriate for us to ask the question, who are we being as we go back out into the world? And you know, I have a definition of successFor me, it's very simpleIt's not about wealth and fame and powerIt's about how many shining eyes I have around meSo now I have one last thought, which is that it really makes a difference what we sayThe words that come out of our mouthI learnt this from a woman who survived Auschwitz, one of the rare survivorsShe went to Auschwitz since she was 15 years old and her brother was eight and the parents were lostAnd she told me this, she said, we were in the train going to Auschwitz and I looked down and I saw my brother's shoes were missingAnd I said, you should just jump it, can't you? Keep your things togetherThe goodness sake, the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brotherUnfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him because she never saw him againHe did not surviveAnd so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow, she told me thisShe said, I walked out of Auschwitz into lifeAnd I made a vowAnd the vow was, I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever sayNow, can we do that? No, and we'll make ourselves wrong, another's wrongBut it is a possibility to live intoThank youThank youI'm just going to go ahead and get the startThis is a work in process based on some comments that were made at Ted two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccineSo 29 years ago, I had this thermo teach who talked about absorption refrigerationIt was one of those things that stuck in my headIt was a lot like the Sterling EngineIt was cool, but you didn't know what to do with itAnd it was invented in 1858 by this guy, Ferdinand Carre, but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools at the timeIt's crazy, crazy Canadian, and empowered, crawlsly, commercialized this thing called the icy ball in 1928And it was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why I didn't workBut here's how it worksThere's two spheres in the separated indistenceOne has a working fluid, water, and ammoniaThe other is a condenserYou heat up one side, the hot side, the ammonia evaporates, and it recondenses in the other sideYou let it cool to room temperatureAnd then as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the earth's wild hot side, it creates a powerful cooling effectSo it was a great ideaDidn't work at allThey blew upBecause they're using ammonia, you get hugely high pressures, if you heat it them wrongget a top 400 PSI, the ammonia was toxic, it's great everywhereBut it's kind of an interesting thoughtSo, it's a great thing about 2006There's a lot of really great computational work you can doSo we got the whole thermodynamics department that Stanford involved, a lot of computational fluid dynamicsWe proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrongWe found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressuresBrought an atteme from the UK, there's a lot of great refrigeration people that turn down in the UK and built a test rig and proved that in fact we could make a low pressure non-toxic refrigeratorSo this is the way it worksYou put it on a cooking fireMost people have cooking fires in the world whether it's camel-dung or woodHeads up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hourYou put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hoursIt looks like thisThis is the fifth prototypeIt's not quite doneways about eight poundsAnd this is the way it worksYou put it into a 15-liter vessel about three gallons and it'll cool it down to just above freezing, three degrees above freezing for 24 hours in a 30-degree C environmentIt's really cheapWe think we can build these in high volumes for about $25 in low volumes for about $40And we think we can make a refrigeration something that everybody can haveThank youOne way to change our genes is to make new ones as Craig Ventor has so elegantly shownAnother is to change our lifestylesAnd what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefitsWhen you eat healthier, managed stress, exercise, and love more, your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygenBut more than that, your brain gets measurably biggerthings that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured nowThis was a figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of usNow there's some things that you can do to make your brain grow into brain cells, some of my favorite things like chocolate and tea, blueberries, alcohol and moderation, stress management, and cannabinoids found in marijuanaKind of just a messengerWhat were we just talking about? And other things that can make it worse, it can cause you to lose brain cells, the usual suspects like saturated fat and sugar, nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stressYour skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyleSo you age less quickly, your skin doesn't wrinkle as muchYour heart gets more blood flowWe've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease that these clogged arteries that you seen the upper left after only a year become measurably less cloggedAnd the cardiac pet scan shown in the lower left, the blue means no blood flowA year later, Argin White is maximum a blood flowWe've shown you may be able to stop a reverse progression of early prostate cancer by extensionBreast cancer simply might make these changesWe found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited 70% in the group that made these changes whereas only 9% in the comparison group, these differences were highly significantEven your sexual organs get more blood flow, to you increase sexual potencyOne of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services showing that nicotine which constricts your arteries can cause a heart attack or a stroke, but it also causes impotence, half of guys who smoke or impotence, how sexy as thatAnd we're also about to publish a studyThe first study showing you can change gene expression and men with prostate cancerThis is what's called a heat map and the different colors and along the side on the right are different genesAnd we found that over 500 genes were favorably changedand effect turning on the good genes that disease preventing genes, turning off the disease promoting genesAnd so these these findings, I think, are really very powerful of giving many people new hope and new choicesAnd companies like Navigenex and DNA Direct and 23 and me that are giving your genetic profiles are getting some people a sense of gosh, well, what can I do about it? Well, our genes are not our fateAnd if we make these changes, they're a predispositionBut if we make bigger changes than we might have made Otherwise, we can actually change Howard James Rage's pressThank youAPPLAUSEWell, I'm involved in other things besides physicsIn fact, mostly now and other thingsOne thing is distant relationships among human languagesAnd the professional historical linguists in the US and in Western Europe, mostly try to stay away from many long-distance relationshipsbig groupings that go back a long time longer than the familiar familiesThey don't like that they think it's crankI don't think it's crankAnd there's some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, it's kind of a institute and in MoscowAnd I would love to see where that leadsDoes it really lead to a single ancestor, some 20, 25,000 years ago? And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor when there was presumably a competition among many languages? How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go? How many tens, how many tens of thousands of years does it go back? Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is? Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay of the caves in Western Europe in the organization period, some 35,000 years ago or earlierI can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a mountain languageSo I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe furtherBut that doesn't mean that all or many or most of today's languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say, 20,000 years or something of that kindThat's what we call a bottleneckWell, Philip Anderson may have been rightYou may just know more about everything than anyoneSo it's been an honorThank you, MaraGo onThank youThank youHow does the news shape the way we see the world? Here's the world based on the way it looks based on landmassAnd here's how news shapes what Americans seeThis map shows the number of seconds that American networking cable news organizations dedicated to news stories by country in February of 2007, just one year agoNow this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilitiesThere was massive flooding in IndonesiaAnd in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warmingThe US accounted for 79% of total news coverageAnd when we take out the US and look at the remaining 21% we see a lot of Iraq, that's that big green thing therelittle else, the combined coverage of Russia, China, and India, for example, reached just 1%When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story, here's how the world lookedWhat was that story? The death of Ananacol SmithThis story eclipsed every country except Iraq and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC reportAnd this cycle continues as we all know Brittany has loomed pretty large latelySo why don't we hear more about the world? One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by halfAside from one person ABC mini bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi, and Mumbai, there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America, places that are home to more than two billion peopleThe reality is, is that covering Brittany is cheaperIn this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for newsLocal TV news looms large and unfortunately only dedicates 12% of its coverage to international newsAnd what about the web? The most popular news sites don't do much betterLast year, Pew and Columbia J school analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google news as front page, and they, in fact, covered the same 24 news eventsSimilarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from USnews creators is recycled stories from the APYR services and writers, and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to itSo if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates, as well as less educated Americans, no less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years agoAnd if you think that it's simply because we are not interested, you would be wrongIn recent years, Americans, you say they closely follow global news most of the time, grew to over 50%The real question is this distorted world view, what we want for Americans, and are increasingly interconnected worldI know we can do better and can we afford not toThank youI have given the slideshow that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 timesI'm given a short slideshow this morning that I'm giving for the very first timeSo, well, it's, I don't want to raise the barI'm actually trying to lower the bar because I've cobbled this togetherto try to meet the challenge of this sessionAnd I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that if religion really properly understood is not about belief, but about behaviorPerhaps we should say the same thing about optimismHow dare we be optimisticOptimism is sometimes characterized as a beliefAn intellectual posture, as Mahatma Gandhi famously said, you must become the change you wish to see in the worldAnd the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behaviorBut the word behavior is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this contextI may be a big advocate of changing the light bulbs and buying hybrids and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house and dug the geothermal wells and done all of that other stuff, but as important as it is to change the light bulbs, it's more important to change the lawsAnd when we change our behavior in our daily lives, we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy partIn order to be optimistic about this, we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracyIn order to solve the climate crisis, we have to solve the democracy crisisAnd we have oneI have been trying to tell this story for a long timeI was reminded of that recently by a woman who walked past the tableI was sitting at just staring at me as she walked pastShe was in her 70slooked like she had a kind faceI thought nothing of it until I saw it from the corner of my eyesShe was walking from the opposite direction, also just staring at meAnd so I said, how do you do? And she said, you know, if you died your hair black, you would look just like Al GoreMany years ago when I was a young congressman, I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control and the nuclear arms raceAnd the military historians taught me during that quest that military conflicts are typically put into three categories, local battles, regional or theater wars, and the rare but all important global world war, strategic conflictsAnd each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources, a different approach, a different organizational modelEnvironmental challenges fall into the same three categoriesAnd most of what we think about are local environmental problems, air pollution, water pollution, hazardous waste dumpsBut there are also regional environmental problems like acid rain from the Midwest to the northeast and from Western Europe to the Arctic, from the Midwest, out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico and there are lots of thoseBut the climate crisis is the rare but all important global or strategic conflicteverything is affectedAnd we have to organize our response appropriatelyWe need a worldwide global mobilization for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency, and a global transition to a low-carbon economyWe have work to doAnd we can mobilize resources and political willBut the political will has to be mobilized in order to mobilize the resourcesLet me show you these slides hereI thought I would start with the logoWhat's missing here, of course, is the North Polar Ice CapGreenland remains28 years ago, this is what the Polar Ice Cap, the North Polar Ice Cap looked like at the end of the summer at the fall equinoxThis last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate LaboratoryThis is what's happened in the last 28 yearsTo put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous recordHere's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchersThe North Polar Ice Cap is the same size geographicallyIt doesn't look that quite the same size, but it is exactly the same size as the United States minus an area roughly equal to the state of ArizonaThe amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything used to the MississippiThe extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this muchcomes back in the winter, but not as permanent ice as thin ice, vulnerableThe amount remaining could be completely gone and summer in as little as five yearsThat puts a lot of pressure on GreenlandAlready around the Arctic Circle, this is a famous village in AlaskaThis is a town in NewfoundlandAntarctica, latest studies from NASA, the amount of moderate to severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of CaliforniaThere were the best of times over the worst of timesThe most famous opening sentence in the English literatureI want to share briefly a tale of two planetsBoth in Venus are exactly the same sizeEarth's diameter is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same sizeThey have exactly the same amount of carbonBut the difference is on Earth, most of the carbon has been leached over time out of the atmosphere deposited in the ground as coal, oil, natural gas, etcOn Venus, most of it is in the atmosphereThe difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average on Venus, it's 855This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible when putting it into the atmosphereIt's not because Venus is slightly closer to the sun, it's three times hotter than Mercury, which is right next to the sunNow briefly, here's an image you've seen as one of the only old images, but I show it But because I want to briefly give you CSI climateThe global scientific community says, man-made global warming pollution put into the atmosphere thickening this is trapping more of the outgoing infraredYou all know thatAt the last IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say, how certain are you? They wanted to answer that 99%The Chinese objected and so the compromise was more than 90%Now the skeptics say, oh, wait a minute, this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sunIf that were true, the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphereIf it's more coming in, if it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler hereHere is the lower atmosphereHere is the stratosphereCoolerYes, I claim itNow, here's the good news68% of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming69% believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant wayThere has been progressBut here is the keyWhen given a list of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom, what is missing is a sense of urgencyIf you agree with the factual analysis, but you don't feel the sense of urgency, where does that leave you? Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I had in conjunction with the current TV, who did this pro bono, did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate thisThis was the winnerOh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! In BC, I'll show all of the networks here, the top journals for NBC as 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates, two of them were about the climate crisisABC, 844 questions, two of the climate crisisFox, two, CNN, two, CBS, zeroFrom laughs to tear, This is one of the old tobacco commercialsSo here is what we're doingThis is gasoline consumption in all of these countries, and usBut it's not just the developed nationsThe developing countries are now following us and accelerating their paceAnd actually, their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent of where we were in 1965, and they're catching up very dramaticallyThe total concentrations by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture, we would still have this crisisBut we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisisThis is in Bolivia, over 20, over 30 yearsThis is peak fishing in a few secondsthe 60s, 70s, 80s, 90sWe have to stop thisAnd the good news is that we canWe have the technologies, we have to have a unified view of how to go about thisThe struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions all has a single very simple solutionHe was a what's the solution? Here it is, put a price on carbonWe need a CO2 tax revenue neutral to replace, to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck, and some things have changed since the 19th centuryIn the poor world, we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis, plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted if we do not solve the climate crisisBut responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countriesThis is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europeof this was from Nature MagazineThese are concentrating solar renewable energy plants linked in a so-called super grid to supply all of the electrical power to Europe largely from developing countriesHigh voltage DC currentsThis is not pie in the skyThis can be doneWe need to do it for our own economythe latest figures show that the old model is not workingThere are a lot of great investments that you can makeIf you are investing in tar sands or shale oil, then you have a portfolio that is crammed with subprime carbon assetsAnd it is based on an old modelJunkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapseDeveloping tar sands and coal shale is the equivalentHere are just a few of the investments that I personally think make senseI have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer thereBut geothermal concentrating solar advanced photovoltaics, efficiency, and conservationYou've seen this slide before, but there's a changeThe only two countries that didn't ratify now there's only oneAustralia had an election and there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people thereAnd we trained 250 people to give the slideshow in every town and village and city in Australialot of other things contributed to it, but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on KyotoAnd he hasNow, they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have hadThis is Lake LinereMy friend Heidi Cohen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes namesWe would call the one in the southeast now Katrina and we would say it's headed toward AtlantaWe can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political cultureHere's more good newsThe city's supporting Kyoto in the USare up to 780 and I thought I saw one go by there just to localize this, which is good newsNow, to close, we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routineWhat we need is another hero generationWe, those of us who were alive in the United States of America today, especially, but also the rest of the world, have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choiceThis is Jill Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going throughWe now have a culture of distraction, but we have a planetary emergencyAnd we have to find a way to create in the generation of those alive today a sense of generational missionI wish I could find the words to convey thisThis was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet, another that ended slavery and that gave women the right to voteWe can do thisDon't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do itIf we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War, we could be well on the way to solving this challengeWe have the capacity to do itOne final pointI'm optimistic because I believe we have the capacity at moments of great challenge to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to usSometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying, oh, this is so terribleWhat a burden we haveI would like to ask you to reframe thatHow many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts, that has a challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could doI think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation, about which a thousand years from now, Philharmonic orchestras, and poets and singers will celebrate by saying they were the ones that founded within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human futureLet's do thatThank you very muchOh, helloSo many people at TED, there is deep pain that basically a design issue, at the end of the day a design issue on a voting form, one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come trueThat hurtsYou have no ideaWhen you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now, I mean, there's a, are you excited by their plans on global warming? The answer to the question is hard for me because on the one hand, I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee, certain nominee, John McCain, And both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination, all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisisAll three have offered leadership and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administrationAnd I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals But the campaign dialogue as illustrated by the questions, that was put together by the League of Conservation voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questionsAnd by the way, the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian Label Clean CallHas anybody noticed that? Every single debate's been sponsored by Clean Call now, even lower emissionsThe richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really neededSo they're saying the right things and they may, whichever of them is elected, may do the right thingBut let me tell you, when I came back from Kyoto in 1997 with a feeling of great happiness that we'd gotten that breakthrough thereright through thereAnd then, confronted the United States Senate, only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm, to ratify that treatyWhatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside, what the people sayThis challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization, CO2ZX, hailing breath of our civilization literallyAnd now we've mechanized that process, changing that pattern requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the pastSo that's why I began by saying, be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen, demand, change the light bulbs, if it change the laws, change the global treatiesWe have to speak upWe have to solve this democracyWe have sclerosis in our democracyAnd we have to change thatUse the internetGo on the internetConnect with peopleBecome very active as citizensHave a more at TorimaWe shouldn't have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren't able to capture and store CO2Which means we have to quickly build these renewable sourcesNow nobody is talking on that scale, but I do believe that between now and November, it is possibleThis alliance for climate protection is going to launch a nationwide campaignGrassroots, mobilization, television ads, internet ads, radio, newspaper with partnerships with everybody from the girls, scouts to the hunters and fishermenWe need helpWe need helpAnd in terms of your own personal role going forward out, is that something more that you would like to be doing? I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that questionWhat can I do? But MrFuller wants to wrote, if the future of all human civilization dependent on me, what I do, how would I be? It does depend on all of us, but again, not just with the light bulbsWe, most of us here, are AmericansWe have a democracyWe can change things, but we have to actively changeWhat's needed really is a higher level of consciousnessThat's hard to createBut it is comingThere's an old African proverb that some of you know that says, if you want to go quickly, go alongIf you want to go far, go togetherWe have to go far quicklySo we have to have a change in consciousness, a change in commitment, a new sense of urgency, a new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challengeI'll go thank you so much for coming to TedThank you very much, BillThank youThank youThank youThank youThank youThank youThank youI'm working with motion and animation and also I'm an old DJ and a musicianSo music videos is something that I always found interestingBut they always seem to be so reactiveSo I was thinking, can you remove the us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it? So with two designers, Paul Gengrystina at my office, we took a trackMany of you probably know it, it's about 25 years old and it's David Baron and Brian you know, and we did this little animation, and I think that it's maybe interesting also that it deals with two problematic issues which is rising waters and religionThis is so good, strike! Keep going, the wind! You want more of the flag? That's the world! You're the flag! I believe it's all! No one can give me! I've been watching that duvet kick before! He come and run, never strike! Come and move ahead and do thisI'm just done as some boringThey can't really showAnd the sun began to move up and I'm just done like thisCome and blow him! Come and give him a sack! Oh, okayUh, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, It's been far from a very tight It's been a good day I'm gonna say oh yes, come on in It was so dark and we don't need a very tight Thank youGood morningLet's look for a minute as the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da VinciWe're all familiar with his fantastic work, his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writingsBut we do not know his faceThousands of books have been written about him, but there's controversy, and it remains about his looksEven this well-known portrait is not accepted by many other historiansSo what do you think? Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it? Let's find outLeonardo was a man that drew everything around himHe drew people anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everythingBut no facesI find that hard to believeHis contemporaries made faces like the ones you see hereOur fuss of three quarters, so surely a passion at drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits sometimes a timeSo let's try to find themI think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at usSo I looked at all of his drawings more than 700 and looked for male portraitsThere are about 120 you see them herewhich ones of these could be self-portraits? Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw on fast or three quarters, so we can eliminate all the profilesIt also has to be sufficient to detail, so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylizedAnd we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man, so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricaturesAnd look what happens, only three candidates remain that fit the billAnd here they areYes indeed, the old man is thereAs is this famous pandrome of the home of the truvianasAnd lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted the musicianAnd before we go into these faces, I should explain why I have some right to talk about themI've made more than 1100 portraits myself for newspapers over the course of 30 years, sorry, 30 years onlyBut there are 1100 and very few artists have drawn so many facesSo I know a little about drawing and analyzing facesOkay, now let's look at these three portraits and hold on to your seats because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad foreheadThe horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small well-developed chinI couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw thatThere was no reason why these portraits should look alikeAll we did was look for a portrait that had the characteristics of a self-portrait and look they do are very similarNow, are they made in the right order? The young man should be made first, and as you see it from the years that they were created, it is in the case, they are made in the right orderWhat was the age of Leonardoette the time? Does that fit? Yes, it doesHe was 33, 38, and 63 when these were madeSo we have three pictures, potentially, of the same person, of the same age as Leonardoette the timeBut how do we know it's him and not someone else? Well, we need a referenceAnd here's the only picture of the unauderated that's widely acceptedAnd the statue made by Virocchio of David for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15And if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician, you see the very same features againThe statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three facesLadies and gentlemen, This story has not yet been publishedIt's only proper that you hear it, Ted, hear and see it firstThe icon of icons finally has a faceHere he isThey are not allowed to ventureThank youI grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder schizophreniaAnd as a sister and later as a scientist, I wanted to understand why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come trueWhat is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses and I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I was working in the lab of DrFrancine Benus in the Harvard Department of PsychiatryIn the lab, we were asking the question, what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control? As compared with the brains of individuals' diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizophrenia, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder? So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitary of the brain, which cells are communicating with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities of those chemicalsSo there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for Nalami, the National Alliance on Mental IllnessBut on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my ownA blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brainAnd in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all informationOn the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of my lifeI essentially became an infant and a woman's bodyIf you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate for one anotherAnd I have brought for you a real human brainYesThank youThank youThank youSo this is a real human brainThis is the front of the brain, the back of the brain with a spinal cord hanging downAnd this is how it would be positioned inside of my headWhen you look at the brain, it's obvious that the two cerebral core disease are completely separate from one anotherFor those of you who understand computers, are right hemisphere functions like a parallel processorWhile our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor, the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus colosum, which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibersBut other than that, the two hemispheres are completely separateBecause they process information differently, each of our hemispheres think about different thingsThey care about different thingsAnd dare I say, they have very different personalitiesExcuse meThank youIt's been a joyIt's been a joyIt's a joyIt's a joyOur right human hemisphere is all about this present momentIt's all about right here right nowOur right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures, and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodiesInformation in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems, and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like, and what it sounds likeI am an energy bean connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphereWe are energy beans connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human familyAnd right here, right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better placeAnd in this moment, we are perfect, we are whole, and we are beautifulMy left hemisphere, our left hemisphere, is a very different placeOur left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodicallyOur left hemisphere is all about the past, and it's all about the futureOur left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details, details, and more details about those detailsIt then categorizes and organizes all that information, associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future, all of our possibilitiesAnd our left hemisphere thinks in languageIt's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external worldIt's that little voice that says to me, hey, you got to remember to pick up an antis on your way homeI need them in the morningIt's that calculating intelligence that knows that reminds me when I have to do my laundryBut perhaps most important, it's that little voice that says to me, I amI amAnd as soon as my left hemisphere says to me, I amI become separate, I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me, and separate from youAnd this is a portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my strokeOn the morning of the strokeI woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eyeAnd it was the kind of pain, caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice creamAnd it just gripped meAnd then it released meAnd then it just gripped meAnd then it released meAnd it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of painAnd so I thought, OK, I'll just start my normal routineSo I got up and I jumped onto my cardiac lighter, which is a full body full exercise machineAnd I'm jamming away on this thingAnd I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the barAnd I thought that's very peculiarAnd I looked down at my bodyAnd I thought, whoa, I don't know, weird looking thingAnd it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experienceIt was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse so I get off the machineAnd I'm walking across my living room floor and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way downAnd every step is very rigid and very deliberateThere's no fluidity to my paceAnd there's this constriction in my area of perceptionSo I'm just focused on internal systemsAnd I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the showerAnd I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my bodyI heard a little voice saying, okay, you muscles, you got to contractAnd you muscles, you relaxAnd now I lost my balance and I'm propped up against the wallAnd I looked down at my armAnd I realized that I can no longer define the boundaries of my bodyI can't define where I begin and where I endbecause the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wallAnd all I could detect was this energy, energyAnd I'm asking myself, what is wrong with me? What is going on? And in that moment, my brain chatter, my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silentJust like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button, total silenceAnd at first, I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind, but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around meAnd because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive, I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful thereAnd then all of a sudden, my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me, hey, we got a problem, we got to get some help But I'm going, oh, I got a problemI got a problemSo it's like, OK, OK, I got a problemBut then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousnessAnd I affectionately refer to this space as law law landBut it was beautiful thereImagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external worldSo here I am in this spaceAnd my job and any stress related to my job, it was goneAnd I felt lighter in my bodyAnd imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were goneAnd I felt the sense of peacefulnessAnd imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggageOh, I felt euphoriaEuphoria was beautiful thereAnd then again, my left hemisphere comes online and it says, hey, you've got to pay attentionWe've got to get help and I'm thinking I gotta get helpI got to focusSo I get out of the shower and I'm mechanically dressedAnd I'm walking around my apartmentAnd I'm thinking I gotta get to workI gotta get to workCan I drive? Can I drive? And in that moment, my ride arm went totally paralyzed by my sideAnd I realized, oh my gosh, I'm having a strokeI'm having a strokeAnd then the next thing my brain says to me is, wowThis is so coolThis is so coolHow many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out? And then it crosses my mindBut I'm a very busy womanI have time for a strokeIt's like, OK, I can't stop the strokes from happeningSo I'll do this for a week or two and then I'll get back to my routineOK, so I got to call helpI got to call workcould remember the number of worksSo I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number on itSo I go into my business roomI pull out a three inch stack of business cardsAnd I'm looking at the card on topAnd even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye, what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this was my card and not, because all I could see were pixelsAnd the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background, and the pixels of the symbols, and I just couldn't tellAnd then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarityAnd in that moment, I would be able to reattach to normal realityAnd I could tell that's not the card, that's not the card, that's not the cardIt took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cardsIn the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphereI do not understand numbersI do not understand a telephone, but it's the only plan I haveSo I take the phone pad, and I put it right hereI take the business card, I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the foam padBut then I would drift back out into La Land and not remember if when I come back if I'd already dialed those numbersSo I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality, I'd be able to tellYes, I've already dialed that numberEventually, the whole number gets dialed, and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me, And I think that myself, oh my gosh, he sounds like a golden retrieverAnd so I say to him, clear in my mind, I say to him, this is Jill, I need helpAnd what comes out of my voice is, oh, oh, oh, ohI think, oh my gosh, I sound like a golden retrieverSo I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I triedSo he recognizes that I need help and he gets me helpAnd a little while later, I'm writing in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Mass General HospitalAnd I curl up into a little fetal ballAnd just like a balloon with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloonI just felt my energy lift and just, I felt my spirit surrenderAnd in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life and either the doctor's rescue my body and give me a second chance a life or this was perhaps my moment of transitionWhen I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still aliveWhen I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my lifeMy mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of realityStimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure painLight burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in spaceI felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great way of gliding through a sea of silent euphoriaNirvanaI found NirvanaI remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little bodyBut then I realized, but I'm still aliveI'm still alive, and I have found NirvanaAnd if I have found Nirvana, and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive can find NirvanaAnd I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any timeand that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this pieceAnd then I realized, what a tremendous gift this experience could beWhat a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our livesAnd it motivated me to recoverTwo and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centersHere I am with my mama, who's a true angel in my lifeIt took me eight years to completely recoverSo who are we? We are the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive mindsAnd we have the power to choose moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the worldRight here, right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we areI am the life force power of the universeI am the life force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my formAnd one with all it isOr I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual, a solid separate from the flow, separate from youI am DrJill Bolte Taylor, intellectual, Neural and AtomestThese are the we inside of meWhich would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheresThe more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will beAnd I thought that was an idea we're spreadingThank youI'm here to enlist you and helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things doneHere's the old storyWe've already heard a little bit about itBiology is war in which only the fiercest surviveThis is a nation's succeed only by defeating, destroying, and dominating competitionPolitics is about your side winning at all costsBut I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emergeIt's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines in which cooperation, collective action, and complex interdependencies play a more important role and the central, but not all important role of competition and survival of the fittestjust a little bit to make roomI started thinking about the relationship between communication, media, and collective action when I wrote smart mobsAnd I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about itIn fact, if you look back, human communication media and And the ways in which we organize socially have been co-volving for quite a long timeHumans have lived for much, much longer than approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groupsNomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering foodThe form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay aliveBut at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger gameAnd we don't know exactly how they did this, although they must have solved some collective action problemsIt only makes sense that you can't hunt master dons while you're fighting with the other groupsAnd again, we have no way of knowing, but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emergedMore protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rottedSo that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forumsDid the people who ate that mass did on me owe something to the hunters and their families? And if so, how do they make arrangements? Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involvedOf course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations, the first cities, built of mud and brick, the first empiresAnd it was the administrators of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marksMarks on clay in that timeNot too much longer after that, the alphabet was inventedAnd this powerful tool was really reserved for thousands of years for the elite administrators who kept track of accounts for the empiresAnd then another communication technology enabled new mediaThe printing press came alongAnd within decades, millions of people became literateAnd from literate populations, new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge, religion, and politicsWe saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant reformation, constitutional democracies, possible where they had not been possible before, not created by the printing press, but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacyAnd again, new forms of wealth emergedNow commerce is ancientMarkets are as old as the crossroadsBut capitalism, as we know, it is only a few hundred years old, enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies, such as the joint stock ownership company, shared liability insurance, double entry bookkeepingNow, of course, the enabling technologies are based on the internetAnd in many, too many era, every desktop is now a printing press, a broadcasting station, a community, or a marketplaceEvolution is speeding upMore recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktopsAnd very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant portion if not the majority of the human race, walking around, holding, carrying or wearing, supercomputers, linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband todayNow when I started looking into collective action, the considerable literature on it, based on what sociologists call social dilemmas, and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmasI'm going to talk briefly about two of them, the prisoners dilemma and the tragedy of the commonsNow when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly, he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoners dilemmaSo I'm just going to go over that very, very quicklyIf you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly laterThe prisoners dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war, two players who couldn't trust each otherLet me just say that every unscured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemmaPerson with the goods, person with the money, because they can't trust each other, are not going to exchangeNeither one wants to be the first one, or they're going to get the suckers pay offBut both lose, of course, because they don't get what they wantThey can only agreeIf they can only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different pay off matrix called an insurance game they could proceed20 years ago Robert Axelrod used the prisoners dilemma as a probe of the biological questionIf we're here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all? He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoners dilemma strategies and discovered much to his surprise at a very, very simple strategy one, it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it one, it won the second tournamentThat's known as tip for TathAnother economic game that may not be, as well known as the Prisoners dilemma, is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactionsHere's how the game's playedThere are two players they've never played the game before, they will not play it again, they don't know each other and they are in fact in separate roomsFirst player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split50, 50, 90, 10, whatever that player wants to proposeThe second player either accepts a split, both players are paid and the game is over or rejects the split neither player is paid and the game is overNow that fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because somebody you don't know in another room is going to get 99Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50-50And although they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played the game before, proposals seem to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50-50Now the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other culturesdiscovered to their surprise that slashing burn agriculturalists in the Amazon, or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia, or it does in different cultures, each had radically different ideas of what is fair, which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness, that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions, whether we know that or notThe other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commonsGarrett Harden used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s, used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing in the depletion of the resourceYou have the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably disfoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using itNow Eleanor Ostrom, a political scientist in 1990, asked the interesting question that any a good scientist should ask, which is, is it really true that humans will always destroy all commons? So she went out and looked at what data she could findShe looked at thousands of cases of human sharing watersheds, forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case, humans destroyed the commons that they depending onBut she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoners dilemmaIn fact, the tragedy of the Commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemmaAnd she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to beThey escape by creating institutions for collective actionAnd she discovered, I think, most interestingly, that among those institutions that worked, There were a number of common design principlesAnd those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't workI'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplinesIn biology, the notions of symbiosis, group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested to be sureBut there is really no longer any major debate, over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology from the level of the cell to the level of the ecologyAnd again, our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturnedRational self-interest is not always the dominating factorIn fact, people will act to punish cheaters even at a cost to themselvesAnd most recently, Nerophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters and economic gains show activity in the reward centers of their brain, which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies togetherNow I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have help create new economic forms, commerce is ancient, markets are very old, capitalism is fairly recent, socialism emerged as a reaction to thatAnd yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emergingJim Sirawiki briefly mentioned, Yokeye Bankler's paper about open source, pointing to a new form of production, peer-to-peer productionI simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth, we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous onesVery briefly, let's look at some businessesIBM, as you know, HP Sun, some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world, are open sourcing their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the CommonsEli Lilly, and again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world, has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problemsToyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace, treats them as a network and trains them to produce better, even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitorsNow, none of these companies are doing this out of altruismThey're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interestOpen source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm, nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known themGoogle enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through ad senseAmazon has opened its application programming interface to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shopsThey're enriching others, not out of altruism, but as a way of enriching themselvesWe base all the prisoners dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance gameInstead of neither us contrast each other so we have to make suboptable movesIt's you prove to me that you're trustworthy and I will cooperateWikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free and cyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of yearsWe've seen that think cycle has enabled NGOs and developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world, including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now, it's a mechanism for rehydrating color of victims that's so simple to use that alliterates can be trained to use itBit torrent turns every downloader into an uploader, making a system more efficient, the more it is usedMillions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them to link together through the internet into super computing collectives that helps solve of the protein-folding problem for medical researchers that's folding at home, it's Stanford, to crack codes, to search for life and outer spaceI don't think we know enough yetI don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are, but I think we can begin to think about themAnd I don't have enough time to talk about all of them, but think about self-interestThis is all about self-interest that adds up to morein El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that have been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategyIn the US, in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world, citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mold devices and SMSThere's an Apollo project of cooperation, possible, a transdisciplinary study of cooperationI believe that the payoff would be very bigI think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplinesAnd I am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better peopleAnd sometimes people cooperate to do bad thingsBut I will remind you that a few hundred years ago, people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spiritsDaykarts said we need an entire new way of thinking when the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology show that microorganisms caused disease suffering was alleviatedforms of suffering could be alleviated, what forms of wealth could be createdIf we knew a little bit more about cooperation, I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happenIt's going to require effortSo I and list you to help me get the cooperation project startedThank youThank youSo I thought I would talk about deathIt seemed to be the passion todayActually, it's not about deathIt's inevitable, terribleBut really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they dieThat's what I want to talk aboutSo Art Buckwall left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died saying, hi, I'm Art Buckwall, and I just diedAnd Mike, who I met at Gallapagos, which I won a TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace, where he's chronicling his journey through cancerAnd my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebookIn the last two years of his life, when you a sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about meHe wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvementAnd coding, coding specific incidents and held a mirror to my lifeAfter he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymoreHand rating is a disappearing artI'm all for email in thinking while typing, but why give up all habits for new? Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives? There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him and trade all those years for one hugBut too lateBut that's when I take out his letters and I read themAnd the paper that touched his hand is in mine and I feel connected to himSo maybe we all need to leave our children with a value, like I see, and not a financial oneA value for things with a personal touchAn autograph book, a soul searching letterIf a fraction of this powerful terrarians could be inspired by a beautiful paper, John, it'll be recycled oneAnd write a beautiful letter to someone they loveWe actually may start a revolution where our children go to penmanship classesSo, what do I plan to leave for my son? I collect autograph books and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them and CDs too, TracyI plan to publish my own notebook as I witness my father's body being swallowed by fireI sat by his funeral pyre and wroteI've I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book and leave that publish book for my sonI'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote in my father's cremationAnd those linguists please pardon the grammar because I've not looked at it in the last ten yearsI took it out for the first time to come herePicture in a frame, Ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown upI hear you, and I know that you would want me to be strongBut right now, I'm being sucked down, surrounded, and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting, and flourishing just as you taught meYou're encouraging with spurs in my role pool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love againThank youThe End I'm gonna do itI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneI'm gonna go to the next oneYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna do itI'm gonna go! No, buddy, no, buddy, no, buddy, no, buddy, no, buddyI am very, very happy to be a midist, some of the most relates I really disturbing my eyes and they are reflecting on my glassesI am very happy and honored to be a midist, very, very innovative and intelligent peopleI have listened to the three previous speakers and guess what happened? Every single thing I plan to say, they have said it here and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to sayBut there is a saying in my culture that if a bad leaves a tree without saying something, that bad is a young oneSo I will, since I am not young and I'm very old, I still will say somethingWe are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment, because another conference is taking place in Berlin, it is the G8 summitThe G8 summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid, something akin to the Marshall PlanUnfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan, one because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstatedIt's largest recipients who had German and France and was only 25% of the GDP and average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15% of its GDP, and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countriesBut I want to say that there are two things we need to connectHow the media covers Africa in the West and the consequences of that by displaying the the sphere, helplessness and hopelessnessThe media is telling the truth about Africa and nothing but the truthHowever, the media is not telling us the whole truthBecause this sphere, civil war, hunger and famineAlthough their part and part of our African reality, they are not the only reality, and secondly, they are the smallest realityAfrica has 53 nationsWe have civil wars only in six countries, which means that the media are covering only six countriesAfrica has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audienceBut the effect of that presentation is that it appeals to sympathy, it appeals to pity, it appeals to something called charityAnd as a consequence, the Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is from the wronglyThe wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despairWhat should we do with it? We should give food to the hungryWe should delve away from anything as to those who are illWe should do sand piscipping troops, serve those who are facing a civil warAnd in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiativeI want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknessesBut equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potentialWe need to reframe the challenge that is facing AfricaFrom a challenge of despair, despair, which is called poverty reduction, to a challenge of hopeWe frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is world's creationThe challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not a challenge of reducing poverty, it should be a challenge of creating wealthOnce we change those two things, if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction, you have the international cocktail of good intentions, moving on to the continent with what? Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry, and piscophiles for those who are facing civil warAnd in the process, none of these things productive because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes of Africa's fundamental problemsSending somebody at school and giving them medicines, ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for themwealth is a function of income and income comes from you, finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying jobNow once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa, our second challenge will and who are the wealth-collgetting agents in an associated? They are entrepreneursAnd just as simple as all of us, they are always about 4% of the population, the 16% are imitatorsSo, but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurshipSo where should we be putting the money? We need to put money where it can productively growSupport private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreignsupport, research institutions, because knowledge is an important part of world's creationBut what is the international aid the community doing at Africa today? They are throwing large sums of money for primary health, for primary education, for food reliefThe entire content has been turned into a place of despair in need of charityThat is ungenital menCan anyone of you tell me a neighbour, a friend, a relative that you know, who grew well, who became rich by receiving charity, by holding the begging bow and receiving arms, there's anyone of you in the audience have that personDoes anyone of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another? Well, since I'm not sick of the hand, it appears that what I'm stating is trueI can see Bono says he knows the country, which country is that? Thank you very muchBut let me tell you thisExternal actors can only present you an opportunityThe ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacityAfrica has received the many opportunities, many of them we haven't benefitedmuch, why? Because we lack the institutional framework and the policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relationsI'll give you an exampleAnd the cotton wire government, former, former known as the Non-Aconvention, African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods due to free to the European Union marketMy own country Uganda has a water to export 50,000 metric tons of sugar to the European Union marketWe haven't exported one kilogram yetWe import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and CubaSecondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement, African countries that produce beef have brought us to export with Geetafree to the European Union marketNone of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana, has ever made it squatterSo I want to add you today that the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy frameworkAnd all forms of intervention need to support the evolution of the kind of institutions that create wealth, the kind of institutions that increase productivityHow do we begin to do that? And why is aid the bad instrument? Aid is the bad instrumentWhy? Because all governments across the world need the money to surviveMoney is needed for a simple thing like keeping low and orderYou have to pay the am and the police to show a low and orderAnd because many of our governments are quite a dictatorial, they need to really have the amic global oppositionThe second thing you need to do is pay your political hangar zone, why should people support government, well, because it gives them good paying jobsOh, in many African countries, an official opportunities to profit from corruptionThe third is no government in the world with exception of a few like that of idiomine, can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of ruleand the countries in the digital, they need legitimacyTo get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education, primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinicsIf the government's fiscal survival depends on each having to raise money from its own people, such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashionIt will sit with those who create wealthTalk to them about the kind of policies and institutions That unnecessary, for them to expand the scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from themThe problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing to governments in AfricaThe productive margin in our government's such for revenue does not lie in the domestic economyIt lies with international donorsRather than see to with Uganda, Rather than sit with Uganda non-sponuous, Ghanaian businessmen, South African, enter praising leaders, our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World BankI can tell you, if any of you have 10 PhDs, you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industryWhy? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand the business, requires that you listen to the private sector actors in that industryGovernments in Africa have therefore been given and no opportunity by the international community to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank and then this IMF and the World Bank that tell them what the citizens needIn the process, with African people have been said-lined from the policy-making, policy-reintention and policy implementation process in our countriesWe have limited input because he who pays the paper calls the tuneThe IMF, the World Bank, and the Katera of Good Intention in the World has taken over our rights as citizens, and therefore what our governments are doingBecause they depend on aid is to listen to international creditors rather than the Iran citizensBut I want to put a caveat on my argumentAnd that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructiveSome aid may have built a hospital, treated a hungry village, a rather fed a hungry villageIt may have built a road, and that road may have suffered a very good roadThe mistake of the international aid industry is to pick this isolated incidence of success, Generalize them, power billions and billions of dollars into them, and then spread them across the whole worldIgnoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village, the skills, the practices, the norms, and habits that allowed that small, the project succeed, like in Saudi village in Kenya, where Jeffree Sax is working, and therefore generalizes experience as the experience of everybodyEight increases the resources of all the potucafmentsAnd that makes working in the government the most profitable thing you can have as a person in Africa seeking a careerBy increasing the political attractiveness of the state, especially in our ethnicic fragmented societies in Africa, aid tends accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pieLadies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to businessGovernments are not changing it why? Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens, they talk to international donorsSo, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government and that has increased the political tensions in our countries is precisely because we depend on aidI also want to say that it is important for us not that over the last 50 years Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community, in form of technical assistance and financial aid and all other forms of aidbetween 1960 and 2003, our continental received $600 billion of aid, and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in AfricaWhere has all the aid gone? I want to use the example of my own country called Uganda and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought thereIn the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue 25 trillion shilingsExpected for an 8-19 trillionUganda's current expenditure, by recurrent, what do I mean? Handed mouth, is 26 trillionWhy does the government of Uganda budget spend 110% of its own revenue? It's because they're somebody they're called for an aid, who contributes for itBut this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments, but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure, the public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 609 billionThe military, 308, agriculture, which employs 18% of our poverty, street-and-sitizens, takes only 18 billionShared and industry takes 43 billionAnd let me show you what does public expenditure, rather public administration expenditure in Uganda, costitudeThere you goSeventor Company at Ministers, 114 presidential advisors by the way, who never see the president except on televisionAnd when they see him physically, it is at public functions like thisAnd even there, it is him who advises themWe have eight or one units of local government, each local government is organized like the central government, a bureaucracy, a community parliament, and so many jobs for the political Hangar zone, they were 56 and when our president wanted to amend the Constitution and removed Tamile myths, he had to create 25 new districts now, they're 81300 and 33 members of parliament, you need to implement a stadium to host our parliament134 commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies and semi-autonomous government bodies, all of which have directives and cars and, and the final thing, This is addressed to MrBono in his workHe may help us on thisA recent government of Uganda started a found that there are three South and four will drive motor vehicles at the Ministry of Health andquartersUganda has nine hundred and six to one sub-countiesEach of them with a dispensary none of which has an ambulanceSo the four will drive vehicles at the headquarters, drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects while the poor die without ambulances and medicineFinally, I want to say that before I can speak here, I was told that the principal of Ted Glober is that a good speech should be like a miniscuitIt should be short enough to arose interest, but long enough to cover the subjectI hope I have achieved itThank you very muchThank youI really am honored to be here and as Chris said, it's been over 20 years since I started working in AfricaMy first introduction was at the Abjana Airport on us, sweaty, I've recorched, coast morningI had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Meade, given way most everything that I owned and arrived with all the essentials, some poetry, few clothes, and of course a guitar, because I was going to save the world than I thought I would just start with the African continentBut literally within days of arriving, I was told to know on certain terms by a number of West African women that Africans didn't want saving, thank you very much, least of all not by meI was too young, unmarried, had no children, didn't really know Africa and besides my French was pitifulSo it was an incredibly painful time in my lifeAnd yet, it really started to give him the humility to start listeningI think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as wellSo I moved to Kenya and worked in UgandaAnd I met a group of who were warned in women who asked me in 1986 to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution thereAnd I did, and we ended up naming it due to the number of, meaning to go forward with enthusiasmAnd while we were doing it, I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women and so maybe I should try to run a business tooAnd so I started looking around and I heard about a bakery that was run by 20 prostitutesAnd being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this groupAnd what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to surviveAnd it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of languageAnd how the what we call people so often distances us from them and makes them littleI also found out that the bakery was nothing like a businessThat in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person who essentially spent $600 a month to keep these 20 women busy, making little crafts and baked goods, and living on 50 cents a day still in povertySo I made a deal with womenI said, look, we get rid of the charity side and we run this as a business and I'll help youThey nervously agreedI nervously startedOf course, things are always harder than you think they're going to beFirst of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team and we clearly aren't the team hereSo let's, I'll did all this trainingAnd the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Niyama-Rombo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali with a bucket and I sold all these little donuts to peopleAnd I came back and I was like, you see? And the women said, you know, Jacqueline, who in Niyama-Rombo is not going to buy donuts out of an orange bucket from a Tala-American womanAnd it's good for itSo I went the whole American way with competitions, team, and individual, completely feltBut over time, the women learned to sell on their own wayAnd they started listening to the marketplaceAnd they came back with ideas for cassovachips and banana chips and sorghum breadAnd before you knew it, we had cornered the key godly marketAnd the women were earning three to four times the national averageAnd when that confidence surge, I thought, well, it's time to create a real bakerySo let's paint itWomen said that's a really great ideaAnd my soul of what color do you want to paint it? And they said, well, you chooseAnd I said, no, no, I'm learning to listenYou chooseIt's your bakery, your street, your country, not mineThey wouldn't give me an answerSo one week, two weeks, three weeks went byAnd finally, I said, well, how about blue? And they said, blue, blue, blue, blue, let's do a blueSo I went to the storeI brought go down to the Recalcitrant one of allAnd we bought all this paint and fabric to make curtainsAnd painting day, we all gathered in YamuramboAnd the idea was we would paint it white with blue and streamed like a little French bakery, but that was clearly not as satisfying as painting a wall of blue, like a morning skySo blue, everything became blueThe walls were blue, the windows were blue, the sidewalk out front was painted blueAnd a wreath of Franklin was shouting RESP, ECT, the women's hips were swaying, and little kids were trying to grab the paint brushes, but it was there dayAnd at the end of it, we stood across the streetAnd we looked at what we had done, and I said, it is so beautifulAnd the women said, it really isAnd I said, and I think the color's perfectAnd they all nodded their head, except for a go-dance, and I said, what? And she said nothing, and I said what? And she said, well, it is pretty, but you know our color really, it is greenAnd I learned then that listening isn't just about patience, But that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long, it's really hard to say what you meanAnd mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do you don't really think they want to know the truthAnd so that I learned that listening is not only about waiting, but it's also learning how better to ask questionsAnd so I lived in Kikali for about two and a half years doing these two things, and it was an extraordinary time in my life, and it taught me three lessonsthat I think are so important for us today and certainly in the work that I doThe first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealthAs Elena said, when people gain income they gain choice and that is fundamental to dignityBut as human beings we also want to see each otherWe want to be heard by each otherWe should never forget thatThe second is that traditional poverty and aid are never going to solve the problems of povertyAndrew, pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point, which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of povertyYes, we ran this as a business, but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training and the management support, the strategic advice, and maybe most important on all the access to new context networks and new marketsAnd so on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropyAnd on a macro level, some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatizedBut having had a father with heart disease and realizing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten and having a good friend step into help, I really believe that all people deserve access to health and prices they can affordI think the market can help us figure that out, but there's gotta be a charitable component or I don't think we're gonna create the kind of societies we wanna live inAnd so it was really those lessons that made me decide to build acumen fun about six years agoIt's a nonprofit venture capital fund for the poor, few oxymorons in one sentenceIt essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans and both for-profit and non-profit entities that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water to low-income people in South Asia and Africa so that they can make their own choicesWe've invested about $20 million in 20 different enterprises and have, in so doing created nearly 20,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise were not able to afford themI want to tell you two stories, both of them are in AfricaBoth of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service and who really know the markets, both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterpriseAnd both of them, because they are manufacturers, create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly because they are in the malaria sectorAnd Africa loses about $13 billion a year because of malariaAnd so as people get healthier, they also get wealthierThe first one is called Advanced BioExtrax LimitedIt's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur and in Patrick Henry and his three colleaguesThese are old-hand farmers who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in Kenya over the last 30 yearsNow this plant is an art of media plantIt's the basic component for art of misnain, which is the best known treatment from malariaIt's indigenous to China and the far eastBut given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa, Patrick Henry's colleagues said, let's bring it here because it's a high-value ad productThe farmers get three to four times the yield that they would with MaysAnd so using patient capital, money that they could raise early on that actually got below market returns and was willing to go to the long haul and be combined with management assistance, strategic assistanceThey've now created the company where they purchase from 7,500 farmersThat's about 50,000 people affectedAnd I think some of you may have visitedThese farmers are helped by Kickstarter and technosurf who help them become more self-sufficientThey buy it, they dry it, and they bring it to this factory, which purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis, who was real interest in getting the powder so that they can make co-artumAcumans have been working with Abe for the past year, year and a halfBoth on looking at a new business plan, what does expansion look like, helping with management and helping to do term shifts and raise capitalAnd I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so, because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world quality level needed to make GuartamWhen they were in the biggest cash crisis of their historyAnd we called all of the social investors we knowNow some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa and understand the importance of agriculture, and they even help the farmersAnd even when we explain that, if Abe goes away, all those 700 jobs go away tooWe sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social, and it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fusedSo, Aku and May not want but two bridge loans, and the good news is they did indeed the meat worth quality classificationAnd are now in the final stages of closing at $20 million around to move it to the next levelAnd I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East AfricaThis is Samuel, he was actually living in the Kibara Slums when his father called him and told him about art of media and the value at potentialSo he moved back to the farm and long-stray short, they now have seven acres under cultivationSamiles Kizzer and private school, and he's starting to help other farmers in the area, also go into our music production, dignity being more important than wealthThe next one, many of you know, I talked about it a little bit, Oxford two years ago, and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing, which is one of the great real companies in East AfricaIt's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterpriseAnd this is really a story about a public-private solution that has really workedIt started in JapanSo, Metomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticides, so you could create a bednet, malaria bednet that would last five years and not need to be redeppedIt could alter the vectorBut like Artemisia, it had been produced only in East AsiaAnd as part of its social responsibility, So, me, Tomo said, why don't we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa for Africans? Unicef came forward and said, we'll buy most of the nets and then we'll give them away as part of the global funds and the UN's commitment to pregnant women and children for freeAkiman came in with the patient capital and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in AfricaAnd Exxon provided the initial resinWell, in looking around that for entrepreneurs, there was none better that we could find honor than a new Shah and a design manufacturing companyIt's a 40-year-old companyIt understands manufacturingIt's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania and continued for flourishShe had about 1,000 employees when we first found itAnd so, a news took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malariaAnd long story short, again, they've been so successful in our first yearThe first net went off the line in October of 2003We thought the hitting it out of the box number was 150,000 nets a yearThis year, they are now producing eight million nets a year, and they employ 5,000 people, 90% of whom are women mostly on skillsThey're in a joint venture with SumitomoAnd so from an enterprise perspective for Africa and from a public health perspective, these are real successesBut it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty because it's not long-term sustainableIt's a company with one big customerAnd if Avian Flu hits her for any other reason, the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody losesAnd so, a news and an argument have been talking about testing the private sector because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that looking at country like Tanzania, 80% of the population makes less than $2 a dayIt costs at manufacturing point $6 to produce theseIt costs the establishment another $6 to distribute itSo the market price in a free market would be about $12 per netMost people can't afford thatSo let's give it away freeAnd we said, well, there's another optionLet's use the market as the best listening device we haveand understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice we can start building local distribution, and actually it can cost the public sector much lessAnd so we came in with the second round of patient capital to a desired, alone as well as a grant so that a desired could play with pricing and listen to the marketplaceAnd found a number of things, one that people will play different prices, but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at $1 per net and make a decision to buy it, And that when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don't likeAnd that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work, but because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital, we've now found that it costs about $1 in the private sector to distribute an $1 to buy the netSo then from a policy perspective when you start with the market, we have a choiceWe can continue going along at $12 a netThe customer pay is zeroOr we could at least experiment with some of it to charge $1 in that, cost the public sector and other $6 in thatGive the people the dignity of choice and have a distribution system that might over time start sustaining itselfWe've got to start having conversations like thisAnd I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market, but also to bring other people to the table around itWhenever I go to visit Aida's Ed, I think of my grandmother's StellaShe was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machinesShe grew up on a farm in Austria, very poorDidn't have very much educationShe moved to the United States where she met my grandfather who was a cement haulerAnd they had nine children, three of them died as babiesMy grandmother had to burp your locusShe worked in a sewing machine shop making shirts for about 10 cents an hourShe, like some of the women I see at A-desad, worked hard every day, understood what suffering was, had a deep faith in God, loved her children, and would never have accepted a handoutBut because she had the opportunity of the marketplace, and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and educationHer children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreamsI look around at my siblings and my cousins and I said they're a lot of us and I see teachers and musiciansHead fund managers, designers, one sister who makes other people's wishes come trueAnd my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers, and I think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day, is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility, and that they also can believe and get access to services so that their children too can live those lives of great purposeIt shouldn't be that difficultBut what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse, try to assumptions, get out of our ideological boxesIt takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to successIt takes opening your arms both wide and expecting very little love and return, but demanding accountabilityand bringing accountability to the table as wellAnd most of all, most of all, it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience, whether we are rich or poor, African or non-Paper, can local or diaspora left or right to really start listening to each otherThank youThank youLike many of you here, I am trying to contribute to what's around a science in AfricaThe question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadershipAfrica can only be transformed by enlightened leadersAnd it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continentI want to tell you some stories that explain my viewWe all heard about the importance of stories yesterdayAnd the American friend of mine this year volunteers in Erson GhanaAnd in the period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that had taken me over a decade to reachtwice, she was involved in surgeries, where they lost power of the hospitalEmergency generators did not startThere was not a flash light, not a lantern, not a candle, pitch blackPatients cut open twiceThe first time it was a sea section, thankfully baby was out, mother and child survivedThe second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia and aesthetic wears offPatient feels painHe's crying, he's screaming, he's prayingPitch blackNot a candle, not a flashlightAnd that hospital could have afforded flashlightIt could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn'tAnd it happened twiceAnother time she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because it refused to give her oxygen that they hadAnd so three months later, just before she returns to the United States, nurses in a crowd going strike and her recommendation is, take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over againstart all over againNow, what does this have to do with leadership? You see, the folks of the Ministry of Education of Health, the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses, they are among just 5% of their peers who get an education after secondary schoolThey are the eliteThey are our leaderstheir decisions, their actions matterAnd when they fail, a nation literally suffersSo when I speak of leadership, I'm not talking about just political leadersWe've heard a lot about thatI'm talking about the eliteThose who've been trained, whose job it is, to be the guardians of their society, the lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors, the engineers, the civil servants, those are the leaders, and we need to train them rightNow my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occurred when I was 16 years oldWe had just had a military coup and soldiers were pervasive in our societyThey were pervasive presenceAnd one day I go to the airport to meet my father and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building, I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weaponsAnd they asked me to join a crowd of people though running up and down this embankmentWhy? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds, no signs of this effectNow I was 16I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hillI was especially concerned of what the girls, girls, my thinkAnd so I started to argue with these menIt's a little reckless now, 16I got luckyAgana, I always pilot falls into the same predicamentBecause of his uniform, they speak to him differentlyexplained to him that they're just following orders, so he takes her radio, talks to their boss, and gets us all releasedWhat lessons would you take from an experience like this? Several, for me, leadership mattersThose men were following the orders of a superior officerI learned something about courageIt was important not to look at those gunsAnd I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girlsSo a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my educationIt was the breath of fresh airYou know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as I was used to back in GhanaThey wanted us to think critically, they wanted us to be analytical, they wanted us to be concerned about social issuesIn my economics classes, I got high marks in my understanding of basic economicsBut I learned something more profound than that, which is that the leaders, the managers of Ghana's economy, were making breathtakingly bat decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapseAnd so here was this lesson again, leadership mattersIt matters a great dealBut I didn't really fully understand what had happened to meI thought, I had an inklingBut I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplaceAnd I went to work at Microsoft CorporationAnd I was part of this team, this thinking, learning teamwhose job it was to design an implement new software the created value in the worldAnd it was brilliant to be part of this teamIt was brilliantAnd I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore, this transformation, the ability, the ability to confront problems, complex problemsAnd to design solutions for those problems, The ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individualAnd I was part of thatNow, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of GhanaAnd by the way, it's continued to the gap as wide since I leftNow, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this This is occurredI mean, as the people there, we're so hard working, persistent, creative, empoweredBut there are also some external factors, free markets, the rule of law, infrastructureThese things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leadersand those leaders did not emerge spontaneously, somebody trained them to do the work that they doNow while that was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened, I became a parent, and for the first time Africa mattered more to me than ever before, because I realized that the state of the African continent would matter to my children and their children, that the state of the world, the state of the world, depends on what's happening to Africa, as far as my kids would be concernedAnd at this time, when I was going through what I called my pre-midlife crisis, Africa was a messSomalia had disintegrated into AnarchyRwanda was in the throes of this genocidal warAnd it seemed to me that that was a wrong directionAnd I needed to be back helpingI couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids in the upper middle class neighborhood and feel good about itThis was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up inSo I decided to get engagedAnd the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues wereAnd three things get coming upFor every problem, corruption, we can situations and the people who run them, the leadersNow, I was a little scared because when you see those three problems, they seem really hard to deal withAnd they might say, look, don't even tryBut for me, I asked the question, well, where these leaders coming from? What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems? So I went to look at what was happening in education system and it's the same learning by road from primary school through graduate schoolVery little emphasis on ethics and the average, you know, the typical graduate from a university in Ghana has a strongest sense of entitlement than the sense of responsibilityThis is wrongSo I decided to engage this particular problem because it seems to me that every society, every society must be very intentional about how how it trains its leadersAnd Ghana was not paying enough attention, and this is true across the Saharan Africa, actuallySo this is what I'm doingI'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to AfricaI wish there was a liberal arts college in every African countryI think it would make a huge differenceAnd what a Shessi university is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders, we're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity who have the ability to confront the complex problems, to ask the right questions and come up with workable solutionsI'll admit that there are times when it seems like mission impossibleBut we must believe that these kids are smart, that if we involve them in their education, if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront, that are whole society confronts, and if we give them skills, that enable them to engage the real world, that magic will happenNow, a month into this project, which just started classes, and a month into it, I come to the office and I have this email from one of our students, and it said very simply, I am thinking now, and he signs off, thank yousuch a simple statementBut I was moved almost to tears because I understood what was happening to this young manAnd it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this wayI am thinking now, this year we challenged our students to craft an on-a-code for themselvesIt's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now, about whether they should have an on-a-code and if so, what it should look likeOne of the students asked the question that just warned my heart, can we create a perfect society? Her understanding that a student crafted on-a-code code constitutes a reach towards perfectionIt's incredibleNow, we cannot achieve perfection, but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellenceI don't know ultimately what they will doI don't know whether they will decide to have this on a codeBut the conversation that they're having now about what their good society should look like, what their excellent society should look likeIt's a really good thingMy out of timeNow I just want to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about itI'm very excited about the fact that every student at the Sheshi University does community service before they graduate, that for many of them it has been a life-altering experienceThese young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership, the real privilege of leadership, which is, after all, to serve humanityI am even more thrilled by the fact that last year, our student body elected a woman to be the head of student governmentIt's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any universityIt says a lot about herIt says a lot about the culture that's forming on campusIt says a lot about her peers who elected herShe won with 75% of the voteAnd it gives me a lot of hopeIt turns out that corporate West Africa also appreciates what's happening with our studentsWe've graduated two class of students today and every single one of them has been placedAnd we're getting great reports back from corporate Ghana, from corporate West AfricaAnd the things that they're most impressed about is work ethicYou know, that passion for what they're doing, the persistence, the ability to deal with ambiguity, their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen beforeThis is goodBecause, you know, over the past five years, I've been times when I felt this is mission impossible, and it's just wonderful to see so these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids rightI think the current and future leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major innocence on the continentIt's an incredible opportunityanymore opportunities like this in the worldI believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with the March of Democracy and Free Markets across the continentWe have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generationIt will depend on inspired leadershipAnd it is my contention with the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the differenceThank you, God blessThank youGood to see youThanksSo, we've got a picture, I thinkWhere is this? This is my homeThis is where I liveWhere? In Manau, it's in KasungYeah, ManauOkayNow, you're 19 now? Yeah, I'm meant to need it nowFive years ago, you had an ideaWhat was that? I want to medeow in the mirrorWhen you? YeahAnd so, what about for lighting and stuff? YeahSo what did you do? How did you realize that? After I drove out from school, I went to live, and I read a book titled Using AnageAnd I get information about doing the mirrorAnd I try and I am medeowSo, soSo you copied, you exactly copied the design in the bookI knowI just, what happened? In fact, a design of the wind, that it was in the bookIt had four, three plates and mine had four platesthe book had three years at fourAnd you made it out of what? I made four prints just because I want to increase powerOkay, you tested three and found that four worked betterYeah, I justAnd what did you make the windmill out of? What did materials did you use? I use a basketball frame and a pooler and a plastic pipeWhy didn't pose? We have a picture of the next slideYeahIs that what they're in to me? And so, and that when it worked, when they wind bros, it's produced and generates how much electricity, fuel for what? And so that lit a light for the house, how many lights? Four, babbed and two radiosWow, yeahAnd soNext slideSo who's that? This is my parentsWhat in their idea? Oh, my, mySo what do they make of it? You were 14, 15 at the timeWhat do they make of this? They're impressed? YeahAnd so what's your, what are you going to do with this? What do you, I mean, do you want to build another one? Yeah, I want to build another oneTo pump water and a great irrigation for cropsSo this one would have to be biggerYeahHow big? I think, rule, produce more than 20, the votesSo that would produce irrigation for the entire village? YeahWowAnd so you're talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize the streamYeah, they can help me with my videosAnd as you think of your life going forward, your 19 now, do you picture continuing with this stream of working in energy? YeahI'm still thinking to work on an edgeWowWilliam, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conferenceThank you so much for comingThank youThank youWilliamThank youI told you three things last yearI've told you that the statistics of the world is not been made properly availableBecause of that, we still have the old mindset of developing industrialized countries, which is wrongAnd that animated graphics can make a differenceThings are changing, and today, on new United Nations Statistic Division homepage, homepage it says by first or may full access to the databasesAnd if I could share the image with you on the screen, and it's a three thing that happened, you know, you and open the statistic databasesAnd we have a new version of the software, upworking at the B down the netSo you don't have to download it any longerAnd let me ask repeat what you saw last yearthe bubbles of the countries here you have the fertility rate, the number of children government and there you have the length of life in yearsThis is 1950, those were the industrialized countries, those were developing countriesThat's that time that was a we and themThat was a huge difference in the worldBut then it changed and it went on quite well and this is what happensYou can see how China is the red big bubble, the the blue there is India and they go over all this when I try to be a little more serious this year and showing you how things really change and it's Africa which stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it? Large family still and the HIV epidemic brought down the countries like thisThis is more or less what we saw last year and this is how it will go on into the futureI will talk on is this possible because you see now I presented statistics that doesn't because this is where we areWill it be possible that this will happen? I cover my lifetime here, you know? I expect to live 100 years, huh? And this is where we are todayNow, could we look here at, instead the economic situation in the world? And I would like to show that against child survival in swap the axis here you have a child mortality that is survival for kids dying there, 200 dying there and this is GDP per capita on this axisAnd this was 2007And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statisticsHere we go, here we go, here we goNot so much statistics 100 years agoSome countries still have statisticsWe are looking down in the archiveAnd we were down into 1800 and 20There is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbersBut they were down hereThey had $1,000 per person per yearAnd they lost one fifth of their kids before the first birthdaySo this is what happens in the worldIf we play the entire world, how have they got slowly richer and richer? And they add statistics in the beautiful when they get statisticsyou see the importance of thatAnd here, children don't live longerThe last century, 1870 was bad for the kids in Europe, because most of this statistics is EuropeIt was only by the turn of the century that more than 90% of the children survived the first yearThis is India coming up with the first data from IndiaAnd this is the United States moving away here, earning more moneyAnd we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner hereAnd it moves up with Mount Sittum, getting health, not getting so rich, very died, then things drop, ping, brings moneyIt moves this way over hereAnd the bubbles keeps moving up thereAnd this is what the world looks like todayAPPLAUSE APPLAUSE Let us have a look at the United StatesWe have a function hereI can set tell the world, stay where you areAnd I take the United StatesWe still want to see the backgroundI put them up like thisAnd now we go backwardsAnd we can see that the United States go to the right of the mainstreamThey are on the money side all the timeAnd down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India, present contemporary IndiaThat means the United States was richer, but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionallyAnd look here, comparing to the Philippines of todayThe Philippines of today has almost the same economy as United States during the First World WarBut we have to bring United States forwards quite a while to find the same health of the United States as we have in the PhilippinesAbout 1957 here, the health of the United States is the same as the PhilippinesAnd this is the drama of this world, which many called globalize, is that Asia, Arab countries, Latin America, are much more ahead in being healthy, educated, having human resources than they are economicallyThere's a discrepancy in what's happening today in the emerging economiesThere, now social benefits, social progress is going ahead of economic progressAnd 1957, United States had the same economy as Chile has todayAnd how long do we have to You're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldYou're new to the worldand there's a lot of infrastructure, things, and yet real human resources are thereNow, we can take away this, and I would like to show you the rate of speed, the rate of change, how fast they're goneAnd we go back to 1920, and I want to look at JapanAnd I want to look at Sweden and the United States, and I'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here, and the red Toyota down there, and the brownish VolvoAnd here we goHere we goThe Toyota has a very bad start down hereYou can see itAnd the United States Ford is going off road thenAnd the Volvo is doing quite fineThis is the warThe Toyota got off track and now Toyota is coming on the healthier side of SwedenCan you see that? And they are taking over Sweden thenNow, healthier than SwedenThat's the bad way I saw the Volvo in both the ToyotaAnd now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in JapanThey really catch downAnd this change is gradualWe have to look over generations to understand itAnd let me show you my own sort of family historyWe've made these graphs hereAnd this is the same thing, money down there and healthYou know, and this is my familyThis is Sweden 1830, and my great-great-grandma was bornSweden was like Sierra Leone todayAnd this is when great-grandma was born 1863And Sweden was like MozambiqueAnd this is when my grandma was born 1891, she took care of me as a childSo I'm not talking about statisticsNow, now it's over the history in my familyThat's when I believe statisticAnd it's grandma verified statisticsI think it's the best way of verifying historical senseSweden was like GhanaIt's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub-seher and AfricaI told you last year, I'll tell you againMy mother was born in Egypt and I, who am I? I'm the Mexican in the familyAnd my daughter, she was born in Chile and the granddaughter was born in SingaporeNow they have fierce country on this earthbypassed Sweden about two to three years ago with better charts of IBut they're very small, you know, they're so close to the hospital, we can have a beat them out in these four yearsSo it's not that much to sing up or sing up or the other best ones, you know? Now, these looks also like a very good story, but it's not really that easy, that it's all good storyBecause I have to show you one of the other facility, we can also make the color here represent a very But then what have I choose in here? Carbon dioxide emission, metric ton per capitaThis is 1962And United States was a meeting 16 ton per person, and China was meeting 06And India was a meeting 032 ton per capitaAnd what happens when we move on? Where you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthierAnd everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxideThere's no one other than it's so farAnd we don't have the all the updated data and a long because this is really the hot data todayAnd there were two thousand and oneAnd in the discussion I attended with global leaders, many say now, now the problem is that the emerging economy, they are getting out too much carbon dioxideThe minister of the environment of India said, what you are the one who caused the problem, We always see the account list, the high income countries, they were the one who caused the climate changeBut we forgive you because you didn't know itBut from now on, we come per capitaFrom now on, we come per capitaAnd everyone is responsible for the capita emissionAnd this really shows youWe have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climateAnd this is really what has to be changedI've been criticized of showing a two positive image of the world, but I don't think it's like thisThe world is quite a messy placeThis we can call dollar streetEveryone lives on this street hereWhat they earn here, what number they live on is how much they earn per dayThis family earns about $1 per dayWe drive what's the street hereWe find the family here, which earns about $2, $3 a dayAnd we earn, drive what way hereWe find the first garden in the streetand they are on 10 to $50 a dayAnd how do they live? If we look at the bed here, we can see that they sleep on the floorThis is what poverty line is80% of the family income is just to cover the energy need, the food for the dayThis is $2 to $5You have a bed and here it's a much nicer bedroomYou can seeI lecture this for IKEA and they wanted to see the sofa immediately hereAnd this is the sofa, how it will emerge from thereAnd the interesting thing when you go around here in the photo panorama, you see the family still sitting on the floor thereAnd although there is the sofa, if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to ten dollarsIt comes beyond hereWhen you really can get good work in condition in the familyIf you really want to see the difference, you look at the toilet over hereThis can changeThis can changeThese are all pictures and images from Africa, and it can become much betterWe can get out of povertyMy own research has not been in IT or anything like thisI spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers, which was on the verge of famineAnd this is the result of the farmers' needs researchersThe nice thing here is that you can't see who are the researchers on this picturethat's when research function in poor societiesWe must really live with the peopleWhen you're in poverty, it's everything is about survivalIt's about having foodAnd these two young farmers, they are girls now, because the parents are dead in HIV and AIDSThey discuss with the trained agronomistsThis is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Jonathan MekombiraAnd he's discussing about what sort of cassava they would plan, the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found, and they are very, very eagerly interested to get adviceThat's to survive in povertyThat's one contextGetting out of povertyThe women told us one thing, get us technologyWe hate this mortal to stand hours and hours, get us a mill so that we can mill our flowers, then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselvesTechnology will bring you out of poverty, but there's a need for a market to get away from povertyAnd this woman is very happy now bringing her a product to the market, but she's very thankful for the public investments in schooling so she can count and won't be cheated when she reached the marketShe wants her kid to be healthy so she can go to the market and doesn't have to stay homeAnd she wants the infrastructure, this nice with a paved roadThere's also good with credits, micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know, an information will tell her when to go to market with which productsYou can do thisI find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possibleAfrica is not done badIn 50 years they've gone from premedeviant situation to a very decent 100-year-old Europe with its functioning nation stateI would say that sub-seer never can have done best in the world during the last 50 years because we don't consider where they came fromIt's this stupid concept of developing countries which put that Argentina and Uzambic together 50 years ago and said that musambic, it wasWe have to know a little more about the worldI have a neighbor who know 200 types of wineYou know everythingYou know the name of the great, the temperature, and every, I only know two types of wineRed and whiteBut my neighbor only know two types of countriesIndustrializing developingAnd I know 200I know about the small day about the livingYou can do thatBut they have to get serious and how do we get serious? You make a PowerPoint, you know? They make goalsHow much do they office package, no? What is this? What is this? What am I telling? I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of developmentEveryone wants your pet thingIf you're in the corporate sector, you love microcladIf you're fighting in non-governmental organization, you'll lie at the equity between genderOr if you're a teacher, you'll love UNESCO and so onIn global level, we ask what our own thingWe need everythingAll these things are important for developmentEspecially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfareNow, what we need to think about is what is a goal for development and what are the means for developmentLet me first grade, what are the most important means? economic growth to me as a public health professor is the most important thing for for development because it's explained 80% of survivalGovernance to have a government that functions that will broad California out of the mystery I 1850It was the government which made lower function finallyEducation, human resources are importantHealth is also important but not that much as a meanEnvironment is importantHuman rights is also important, but it just get one crossNow what about goals? Where are we going toward? We're not interested in moneyMoney is not a goalIt's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goalGovernance, ratherIt's fun to vote and a little thing, but it's not so muchAnd go to schoolI mean, it's not a goalIt's a meanHelps, I give two pointI mean, it's nice to be healthyMy age, especially, You can stand here, you have to let's goIt gives two plusEnvironment is very, very crucialThere's nothing for the grandkids, if you don't save itBut where are the important goals? It's, of course, it's human rightsHuman rights is the goal, but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development and cultureCatch is the most important thing I would say, because that brings joy to lifeThat's a value of livingSo the seemingly impossible is possibleEven African countries can achieve And I show you the shot that the seemingly impossible is possibleAnd remember, please remember my name messageThat is this, the seemingly impossible is possibleWe can have a good worldI showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint, and I think I will convince you also bycultureBring me my soulSoad soarlingIt's from Onsiant IndiaIt's an cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obviousAnd I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel solid steelThis is the army by on that from the Swedish army 1815The last year we had warAnd it's also solid steelYou can hear here, huh? And I'm going to take this blade of steel and push it down through my body of blood and flesh and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possibleCan I request a moment of absolute silence? Thank youThank you very much ChrisEverybody who came up here said they were scaredI don't know if I'm scared, but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this and I don't have any smart technology But you to look at their no slides, so you'll just have to be content with meWhat I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different AfricaAlready this morning there were some illusions to the Africa that you hear about all the timeThe Africa of HIV AIDS, the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict, and the Africa of disastersWell, it is true that those things are going onThere's an Africa that you don't hear about very muchAnd sometimes, I'm puzzled, and I ask myself whyThis is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded toThis is the Africa of opportunityThis is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destiniesAnd this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do thisThat's what I want to talk about todayAnd I want to start by telling you a story about that change in AfricaOn 15th of September 2005, MrDeppriya La Mesera, a governor of one of the oil-risk rich states of Nigeria, was arrested by the London Metropolitan Policeon a visit to LondonHe was arrested because there were transfers of $8 million that went into some domenta counts that belonged to him and his familyThis arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the economic and financial crimes commission of Nigeria led by one of our most able and courageous people, MrNuhuribadAlameh Seger was a reigned in London due to some slip-offsHe managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria, where, according to a constitution, those in office, as governor's president, as many countries have immunity and cannot be prosecutedBut what happened? People were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of officeToday, alums as we call him for short, is in jailThis is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leadersThis is a story about the fact that people want their resources, managed properly for their good and not taking out to places where they'll benefit just a few of their leadAnd therefore when you hear about the corrupt Africa, corruption all the time, I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countriesAnd that some successes I imagine, does it mean the problem is over the answer is noThere's still a long way to go, but that there's a will thereand that successes are being chocked up on this very important fightSo when you hear about corruption, don't just feel that nothing is being done about this that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruptionThat is not the caseThere's a will to fight and in many countries that fight is ongoing and is being wonIn others, like mine, where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria, the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to goBut the truth of the matter is that this is going onThe results are showing independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption and governance is improvingA study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clad trend upwards in governance in 28 African countriesAnd let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governanceThat is that people talk about corruption, corruption, all the time when they talk about it, you immediately think about AfricaThat's the image, African countriesBut let me say this, if a lance was able to export $8 million into an accounting LondonIf the other people who are taking money estimated at $20 to $40 billion now of developing countries' monies, sitting abroad in the developed countriesIf they able to do this, what is that? Is that not corruption? In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted? So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe, where the money is going, and what can be done to stop it? And working an initiative now, along with a well bank on asset recovery, trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken up broad, developing countries' monies to get that sent backBecause if we can get the $20 billion sitting out there back, it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that has been put togetherAPPLAUSE APPLAUSE The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reformAfricans after the tired, we are tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and careWe are gratefulBut we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reformAnd what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but usWe have to do itWe can invite partners who can support us, but we have to startWe have to reform my economies, change our leadership, become more democratic, be more openTo change and to information, and this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, NigerianIn fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in AfricaI want to tell you, GrandOne in four subsaharan Africa is NigerianAnd it has 140 million dynamic people, chaotic people, but very interesting peopleYou'll never be boredWhat we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselvesAnd with the support of Elida, who was willing at the time to do the reforms, we put forward a comprehensive reform program which we developed ourselves, not the international monetary for not the well bank where work for 21 years and rules to be a vice presidentNo one can do it for youYou have to do it for yourselfWe put together a program that would want get the state out of businessesIt had nothingIt had no business been inThe state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetentSo we decided to privatize many of our enterprisesWe, as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our marketsCan you believe that prior to this reform, which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington to go and take up the post of finance minister? We had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 land lines in its entire 30 year historyHaving a telephone in my country was a huge luxuryYou couldn't get itYou had to bribeYou had to do everything to get a phoneWhen President Toba Sanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, we went from 4,500 lines to 32 million GSM lines on countyNigeria's telecoms market is the second fastest growing in the worldgrowing in the world after ChinaWe are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecomsAnd nobody knows, except a few smart peopleThe smartest one first to come in was the anti-income near South AfricaAnd in the three years that I was finance minister, They made an average of $360 million profit per year360 million in a market in a country that is a poor country with an average by capital income just under $500So the market is thereWhen they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies and three or four others are comingBut there's a huge market out there and people don't know about itOr they don't want to knowSo privatization is one of the things we've doneThe other thing we've also done is to manage our finances betterBecause nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances wellAnd Nigeria with the oil sector had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances wellSo what did we try to do? We introduced the fiscal rule that the link tab budget from the oil price before we used to just budget on whatever oil would bring inBecause oil is the biggest most revenue and insect in the economy, 70% of our revenues come from oilWe did link thatAnd once we did it, we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save, whatever was above that priceWe didn't know we could pull it off, it was very controversialBut what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development, where oil prices were high would grow very fastWhen they crashed, we crashed and we could hardly even pay anything any salaries in the economyThat's smooth and outWe were able to savebefore I left $27 billionWhereas in this went to our reserves, when I arrived in 2003, we had $7 billion in reservesBy the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion as we speak now, we have about $40 billion in reservesDue to proper management of our finances, and that shows up our economy, makes it stable, our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economyWe brought inflation down from 28% to about 11%And we had GDP growth from an average of 23% the previous decade to about 65%Now, so all the changes and reforms were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economyAnd what is more important because we want to get away from oil and diversify and there's so many opportunities in this one big country as a many countries in AfricaWhat was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector, a number from non-oilAgriculture grew at better than 8%As a teleconceptor grew, housing and construction, and I could go on an honorAnd this is for the last trick to you that once you get the macroeconomy straightened out, the opportunities and various other sectors are enormousWe have opportunities in agriculture, like I said, we have opportunities in solid mineralsWe have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or exploredAnd we realize that without the proper legislation to make that possible, that wouldn't happenSo we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the worldWe have opportunities in housing and real estateThere was nothing in a country of 140 million peopleNo shopping mallsAs you know, them hereThis was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of peopleAnd now we have a situation in which the businesses in this small are doing four times the turn of other they had projectedSo huge things in construction, real estate, mortgage, market, financial servicesWe had 89 banks, too many, not doing the real businessWe consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital, share capitalAnd it went from about $25 million to $150 millionThe banks, these banks are now consolidated and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside backless bank of the UK's, bringing in 500 million, stunned that chartered this bringing has brought in 140 million, and I can go on dollars on a non into the systemWe're doing the same with the insurance sector, so in financial services, a great deal of opportunity in tourismA many African countriesA great opportunity, and that's what many people know East Africa forthe world life, the elephant, and so onBut managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very importantSo what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent, a new wave of openness and democratization in which since 2000, more than two thirds of African countries have had multi-party democratic electionsNot all of them have been perfect or will be, the trend is very clearI'm trying to tell you that since the past three years, the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 25% to about 5% per annumThis is better than the performance of many OECD countriesSo it's clear that things are changingConflicts are down on the continent from about 12 conflicts a decade ago were down to three of all conflicts one of the most terrible of course of which is thereforeAnd you know you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent, it looks like the entire continent is affectedBut you should know that this continent is not is a continent of many countriesNot one countryAnd if we are down to three or four conflicts, it means that They are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable, growing, exciting economies, where they are plenty of opportunityAnd I want to just make one point about this investmentThe best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feetAnd the best way to do that is by helping create jobsThere is no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's livesThat's not what I'm sayingThat is fineBut imagine the impact on their familyIf the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselvesIf we can invest in places where you yourself make moneyWhilst creating jobs and may help them people stand on their own feetIsn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go? And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent or the womenThank youAPPLAUSE I have a CD hereI'm sorry that I didn't say anything on timeOtherwise, I would have liked you to have seen thisIt says Africa opened for businessAnd this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the young to stand at the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania where they're having the session in June, but it shows you Africans, and particularly African women who against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world classOne of the women in this video, Nico Gunlesley, making children's clothes, which is started as a hobbyAnd grew into a business, mixing African materials such as we have, with materials from elsewhereSo she'll make a little pair of dongaris with corduroy's with African material mixed inVery creative designsHas reached a stage where she even had an order from Walmartfor 10,000 piecesSo that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing and the women are diligent, they are focused, they work hard, I could go and give in examples, Beatrice Gakuva of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with herHowever, many of these are stopped for capital to expandBecause nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessaryNobody thinks in terms of a marketNobody thinks there's opportunityBut I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now will miss it foreverSo if you want to be in Africa, think about investingThink about the Beatrice'sThink about the Nickes of this world who are doing incredible things that are bringing them into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate incomeSo I invite you to explore the opportunitiesWhen you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselvesThank you very muchThank youWhat I'm going to show you first is quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year agoThis is C-Dragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual dataWe're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming and padding through the thing rearranging it at any way we wantAnd it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are, or how big the images areAnd the most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of CongressAnd it's in the 300 megapixel rangeIt doesn't make me difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given momentIt's also a very flexible architectureThis is an entire bookSo this is an example of non-image dataThis is a bleak house, like DickensEvery column is a chapterAnd to prove to you that it's really text and not an image, we can do something like soTo really show that this is a real representation of the textIt's not a pictureMaybe this is a kind of an official way to read an e-bookI wouldn't recommend itThis is a more realistic caseThis is an issue of the guardianEvery large image is the beginning of a sectionAnd this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of mediumWe've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the gargain we've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution, much higher than you be able to get in the ordinaryAnd we've embedded extra contentYou've got to see the features of this car you can see it here, or other models, or even technical specificationsAnd this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estateWe hope that this means no more pop-ups, no other kind of rubbish like that should be necessaryOf course, mapping is one of those really obvious applications for technology like thisAnd this one I really want to spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as wellBut those are all the roads in the US, superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial imageSo let's pull up now something elseSo this is actually live on the live on the webNow you can go check it outThis is a project called Photosynth, which really marries two different technologiesOne of them is C-DragonAnd the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Snavley, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Sites at U-Dod and Rick Soliski at Microsoft Research, a very nice collaborationAnd so this is live on the webIt's powered by C-DragonYou can see that when we do these sorts of views, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experienceBut the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningfulThe computer vision algorithms have registered these images together, so if they correspond to the real space in which these shots all taken near grassy lakes and the Canadian Rockies, all these shots were takenSo you see elements here of stabilized slideshow or panoramic imagingAnd these things have all been related related spatiallyI'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environmentsThere are some that are much more spatialBut I'd like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data setsAnd this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in this summerTo show you what I think is really the punchline behind this technology, the photosynth technologyAnd it's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we've put up on the websiteWe had to worry about the lawyers and so onThis is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedralthat was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickerIt was typed nother down into flicker, and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts and of the campus and so onAnd each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this modelAnd so these are all flicker imagesAnd they've all been related spatially in this wayAnd we can just navigate in this very simple wayI never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft as very gratifyingI've got this kind of reception hereSo this is, I just can see this is a lot of different types of camerasIt's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRsquite a large number that have been registered together into this environmentIf I can find some of the sort of weird ones, there are so many of them are included by faces and so onThere's somewhere in here, there's actually, there's a series of photographs, here we goThis is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctlySo if we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environmentSo what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environmentThis is now taking data from everybody, from the entire collective memory of visually of what the Earth looks likeAnd Link all of that togetherAll of those photos become linked together and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the partsYou have a model that emerges of the entire Earth, think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's virtual EarthworkAnd this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use itTheir own photos are getting tagged with metadata that somebody else enteredIf somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all that dataAnd I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, since that metaverse, using everybody else's photos and do a kind of cross-model and cross-user social experience that wayAnd of course a byproduct of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on but from the collective memoryThank you so muchThank youThank youThank youThat's greatThank youThat's greatThank youThank youThank youThank youDo I understand this? Do I understand this right? What your software is going to allow is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link togetherYesdiscovery is creating hyperlinks if you will between between images and is doing that based on the content inside the images and that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images haveLike when you do a web search for images that you type in phrases and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is ofNow what if that picture links to all of your pictures and the amount of semantic and connection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really hugeIt's a classic network effectthat is truly incredibleCongratulationsThanks so muchBasically there's a major demographic event going on and maybe the passing the 50% urban point is a economic tipping pointSo the world now is a map of connectivityIt used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest citiesWell we have now as at the end of the rise of the West that's overThe aggregate numbers are overwhelmingSo what's really going on? Will villages of the world are emptying out? The question is why? Here's the unromantic truthAnd the city air makes you freeThey said in Renaissance Germany, some people go to places like Shanghai and most go to the squatter citiesWe're a aesthetics ruleAnd these are not really people oppressed by povertyThey're people getting out of poverty as fast as they canThey're the dominant builders and the largest-nether dominant designersThey have home-brew infrastructure and vibrant-errant lifeOne's sixth is the GDP and India is coming out of MumbaiThey're constantly upgrading in a few cases the government helpsEducation is the main event that can happen in citiesWhat's going on in the street in Mumbai? AlgoranosIt's basically everythingThere's no unemployment in squatter citiesEveryone worksOne sixth of humanity is thereIt's soon going to be more than thatSo here's the first punch lineThe cities of D-Few's, the population bombAnd here's the second punch lineThat's the news from downtownHere it is in perspectiveIt's just another day, just another dayIt's just another day on earthIt's just stars shining down on her life for a million yearsNow we're shining right back upIt's just another dayThank youOkaySome baiters, everyone's out in MaryManhattan in JanuaryI brought the ice tea that you bring the books, spray the flies or the size of your headNext to the palm tree, Did you see the gators looking happy and well fed? Everyone's out in MaryManhattan and JanuaryMy preachers said don't you worry the science has happened all wrong and so who cares It's winter here and I have my halter to bond I have my halter to bond Everyone's happy and merry Man, have to mention You're weary Thank youThank youThank youThank youYou know, one of the intense pleasures of travel in one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past and the wind, touch it and stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plantsJust to know that Jaguar-isham and still journey beyond the Milky Way or the myths of the the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the Himalayah, the Buddha still pursue the breath of the DharmaIt's to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but it's just one model of realityThe consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations agoAnd of course, We all share the same adaptive imperatives, we're all born, we all bring our children to the world, we go through initiation rights, we have to deal with the inexorable separation of deathSo it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have artBut what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every cultureAnd whether it is the Panan and the Force, the Borneo or the Voodoo Aqualites in Haiti, or the warriors in the Kaisu desert of Northern Kenya, the Kurandetto and the mountains of the Andes, or a Kattavansati in the middle of the Sahara, this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month agoOr indeed a yaccerter in the slopes of Chomalunma, Everest, the goddess Mother of the World, all of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself and the earthAnd this is an idea that you think about it, can only fill you with hopeNow, together, the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops a planetAnd it's as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is a biological web of life that you know as a biosphereAnd you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethno sphereAnd you might define the ethno sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations, intuitions, brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousnessThe ethno sphere is humanity's great legacyIt's a symbol of all that we are, and all that we can be as an astonishing and inquisitive speciesAnd just as the biosphere is being severely eroded, so-to is the ethno sphere, and if anything at a far greater rate, no biologists, for example, would there suggest that 50% of all species are more abundant around the brink of extinction because it's simply not true, and yet that, the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity, scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversityAnd the great indicator of that, of course, is language lossWhen each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planetNow, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rulesA language is a flash of the human spiritIt's a vehicle through which a soul of each particular culture comes into the material worldEvery language is an old growth force to the mind, a watershed of thought and ecosystem of spiritual possibilitiesAnd other of those 6,000 languages, as we see here today in Monterey, fully half or no longer being whispered into the ears of childrenThey're no longer being taught to babies, which means effectively unless something changes they're already deadWhat could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language? Have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors and anticipate the promise of the childrenAnd yet that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on earth, roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with them into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongueAnd I know there's some of you say, well, wouldn't it be better? Wouldn't there be a better place if we all just spoke one language? And I say, great, let's make that language, yourbahLet's make it CantoneseLet's make it kogiAnd you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own languageAnd so what I'd like to do with you today is instead of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what, in fact, is being lostNow, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say different ways of being, I really do mean different ways of beingTake for example this child of the Bada Sana, the Northwest Amazon, a people of the Anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk rivers in the east and the belly of sacred snakesNow this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people dependThey have a curious language and marriage rule, which is called linguistic exogamyYou must marry someone who speaks a different language And this is all rooted in the theological pastYet the curious thing is in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken because in intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a languageThey simply listen and then begin to speakOr one of the most fascinating tribes I've ever lived with, the Warani of Northeastern EcuadorAnd astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 and 1957, five missionaries attempted contact made a critical mistakeThey dropped from the air eight by 10 glossy photographs of themselvesAnd what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people are the rain force had never seen anything too dimensional in their livesThey picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form of the figure found nothing and concluded that these were calling cards from the devilAnd so they spearred the five missionaries to deathBut the Warrantie didn't just spear outsideers, they spear did each other54% of their mortality was due to them spear in each otherWe trace genealogy's back-age generations, and we found two instances of natural death, and when we pressured the people a little bit about it, they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we speared him anywayBut at the same time, they had a perspicacious knowledge of the force that was astonishingTheir hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behindIn the early 80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard, I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies, which for the foundation of the values strength and the tom tomakut, and securing the poison used to make zombiesIn order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of WdunAnd Wdun is not a black magic cult on the contraryIt's a complex metaphysical worldviewIt's interesting if I ask you the name of the great religions of the world, what would you say? Christianity is lamb, Buddhism, Judaism, whateverThere's always one continent left out, is the assumption being that Sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefsWell, of course, they didAnd Voodoo simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic diaspora of the slavery eraBut what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between living and the dead, the living of birth is spiritsThe spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water, responding to the rhythm of the dance, to momentarily displace the soul of the living so that for that brief shining moment, The act light becomes the God, that's why the voodooists like to say that you wait people to go to church and speak about God, we dance in the temple and become GodAnd because you are possessed, you are taken by the Spirit, how can you be harmed? You see these astonishing demonstrations, food to act life, in a state of trans, handling burning embers with impunity, a rather astonishing example of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in a state of extreme excitationNow of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the Kogi, of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and Northern ColumbiaThe sentence of the ancient Tyrone civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coasts with plain of Columbia, in the wake of the conquest, these people retreated into an isolated volcanic messif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plainIn a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the SpanishTo this day, they remained ruled by a ritual priesthood, but they're training for the priest to this rather extraordinaryThe young oxides are taken away from their families at the age of three and foursequestered in the shadowy world of darkness and stone huts the base of glaciers for 18 yearsTo nine-year periods to liberally chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation, they spend in their natural mother's wombNow they are metaphorically in the womb of the great motherAnd for this entire time, they are incultured into the values of their societyValues that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic, or we might say the ecological balanceAnd at the end of this amazing initiation, one day there's suddenly taken outNow for the first time in their lives, the age of 18, they see a sunriseAnd in that crystal moment of awareness, the first light, as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of this stunningly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed and stunning gloryAnd the pre-step's back, and so you see it's really, as I've told you, it is that beautifulIt is yours to protectThey call themselves the elder brothersAnd they say, we, who are the younger brothers, are the ones responsible for destroying the worldNow, this level of intuition becomes very importantWhenever we think of indigenous people in landscape, we either invoke who's so in the old canard, the noble savage, which is an idea of racism and simplicity, or alternatively we invite invoke for row and say these people are closer to the earth than we areWell, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weak by nostalgiaThere's not a lot of room for either in the malaria swamps of the asthma, or in the chilling winds of TibetBut they have nevertheless through time and ritual forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it, but on a far subtler intuition, the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it has breathing the bean by human consciousnessNow what does that mean? It means that a young kid from the the Andes, whose raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny, will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than the young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be minedWhether it's a boat of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant, what's interesting is the metaphor that defines a relationship between the individual and the natural worldI was raised in the forest, the British Columbia to believe those forest existed to be cutThat made me a different human being than my friends amongst the quagules who believe that those forests for the abode of Huku, from the crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits, the dwell of the north end of the world, spirits they would have to engage during their hummets initiationNow, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you can begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveriesTake this plant hereThe photograph I took in the northwest Amazon this last AprilThis is Ayahuasca, which many of you have heard aboutfrom most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shamans repertoireWhat makes Ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of itIt's made really of two different sourcesOn the one hand, this Woody Leon, which has in it a series of beta carbolines, harming, harmingly, and mildly, hallucinogenic to take the vignalone, it's rather to have sort of blue haze, smoke, drift across your consciousnessBut it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub and the coffee family called psychotry of theardisThis plant has in it some very powerful trip domains, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyl trip to mean five, methoxy dimethyl trip to meanIf you've ever seen the yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that that substance they make from a different set of species is also contains five methoxy dimethyl trip to meanTo have that powder blown up your nose rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel line with broke paintings and landing on a sea of electricityIt doesn't create the distortion of realityIt creates the delusion of realityIn fact, I used to argue with my professor Richard EMSchulte, who was a man who sparked this like itI look at ERA with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930sI used to argue that you couldn't classify these trip that means as hallucinogenic, because by the time you're under the effects, There's no home anymore to experience a hallucinationBut the thing about trip domains is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoaminoxidaseThey can only be taken orally as taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatured the MAONow the fascinating things of the beta carbonyms found within that Lyanna are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the trip to meanSo you asked yourself a question, how in a flora of 80,000 species of asteroid or plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that we can bind in this way created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than some of the parts? But we use that great euphemism trial in the era, which is exposed to be meaninglessBut you ask the Indians and they say the plants talk to usWell, what does that mean? This tried the co-fahn has 17 varieties of ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to R-I as one speciesAnd then you ask them how they establish your taxonomy, and they say, I thought you knew something about plantsI mean, do you know anything? And I said, noWell, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties on the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different keyNow, that's not going to get you a PhD at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting statementsNow, the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with applied at indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful, but somehow reduced to the margins of history as a real world, meaning our world moves onWell, the truth is, at 20th century, 300 years from now is not going to be remembered for its wars, there's technological innovations, but rather the air in which we stood by, neither actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological cultural diversity on the planetNow the problem isn't changeAll cultures through all time have constant being engaged in a dance with new possibilities of lifeAnd the problem is not technology itselfThe Sue Indians did not stop being Sue when they gave up the bone arrow any more than an American stop being an American when you gave up the horse and buggyIt's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphereIt is powerThe crude face of dominationAnd And whenever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade awayThese are dynamic living peoples being driven out of the existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to, whether it's the egregious DForestation in the homeland of the Panan, a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak, a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silk that seems to be carrying half a borne away to the so-chianise where the Japanese frayters hang light on the horizon ready to fill their holes with raw logs from the forestOr in the case of the Anomami, it's a disease entity that have come in in the wake of the discovery of goldOr if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political dominationIn a genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but, ethnicide, the destruction of people's way of life is not only not condemned, it's universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategyAnd you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground levelI once traveled 6,000 miles from Chendu and Western China over land through Southeast from Tibet to Lasa, where the young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lasa, did I understood the face behind these statistics you hear about, 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes, 12 million people killed by the cadreater in the culture revolutionThis young man's father had been a scribe for the Potchen LamaThat meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasionHis uncle fled with his holiness and the diaspora that took the people to NepalHis mother was incarcerated for the price of crime of being wealthyHe was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails, because she couldn't bear to be without himThe sister had done that brave deed, was put into an education camp, one day she had inadvertently stepped on an armband that of Mao, and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard laborThe pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to beholdAnd in the end, it really comes down to a choiceDo we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony? Or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity? Margaret Meade, the great anthropologist, said before she died, that her greatest fear that was, was that as we drift toward this blindly amorphous generic worldview, not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination, reduced to a more narrow and more narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten that there were even other possibilitiesAnd it's humbling to remember that our species has perhaps been around for 600,000 years, the Neolithic Revolution, which gave us agriculture at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed, the poetry of the Shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood, recreated hierarchy, specialization surplus, is only 10,000 years agoThe modern industrial world, as we know, it is barely 300 years oldNow that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millenniaWhen these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voicesAnd it's within that song that we all read the governability of being what we are, a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples in all gardens find a way to flourishAnd there are great moments of optimismThis is a photograph I took at the northern tip but Bath and Island when I went in our well-hunting with some Inuit peopleAnd this man, O'Layak, told me a marvelous story of his grandfatherThe Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit peopleAnd during the 1950s to establish her sovereignty, we forced them into settlementsThis old man, grandfather refused to goThe family fearful for his lifeTook away all of his weapons, all of his toolsNow, you must understand that Inuit did not fear the coldThey took advantage of itthe runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in carabouhideSo this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic Knight for the blizzard that was blowingHe simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his handAnd as a thesis began to freeze, he shaped it in the form of a bladeHe put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he blurtched for the dog with itHe skinned the dog and improvised a harness, took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled, harnessed up into Jason Dog, and disappeared over the ice flows, shit nice and beltTalk about getting by with nothingAnd this in many ways is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the worldThe Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit, an In the area of land, large and California and Texas put togetherIt's our new homeland, it's called Nunavit, it's an independent territory, they control all mineral resourcesAn amazing example of how a nation-state can reach sea restitution with its peopleAnd finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious, at least all of us who have traveled in these remote reaches of the planet to realize that they're not remote at allThey're home lands of somebodyrepresent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of timeAnd for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geography of hopeSo what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is we believe that politicians will never accomplish anythingWe think that the Palemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the worldAnd so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the worldWe get 35 million hits on our website every month156 nations carry our television channel, our magazines are read by millionsAnd what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethno sphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seenAnd hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually one by one, the central revelation of anthropology that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-beingThank you very muchThank youThis is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students cut down to three minutesAnd it all started one day on a plane on my way to Ted seven years agoAnd then the seat next to you was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor familyAnd she wanted to make something of her lifeAnd she asked me a simple little questionShe said, what leads to successAnd I felt really badly because I couldn't give her a good answerSo I get off the plane and I come to TedAnd I think, geez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful peopleSo why don't I ask them what help done succeed and pass it on to kids? So here we areSeven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes Tess just takeAnd the first thing is passionFreeman Thomas says, I'm driven by my passionTess just do it for loveThey don't do it for moneyCarol Collettis says, I would pay someone to do what I doThe interesting thing is if you do it for love, the money comes anywayWork, Rupert Murdoch said to me, it's all hard workNothing comes easily, but I have a lot of funDid he say, fun, Rupert? YesTests are still have fun working and they work hardI figured they're not workaholicsThey're workahphrolicsGoodAl Descarton says, the B successfulPut your nose down and something and get damn good at itThere's no magic, it's practice, practice, practiceAnd as focus, Normadjuus and said to me, I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thingAnd pushDavid Gallos has pushed yourselfPhysically, manly, you've got to push, push, pushYou've got to push through shyness and self-doubtGoli Han says, I always had self-doubtI wasn't good enoughI wasn't smart enoughI didn't think I'd make itNow it's not always easy to push yourselfAnd that's why they invented mothersThank you, EricFrank Gary said to me, my mother pushed meServeSure, when Newlin says it was a privilege to serve as a doctorNow, a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionairesAnd the first thing I say to them is, okay, when you can't serve yourself, you got to serve other something of value, because that's the way people really get richIdeas, headster Bill Gates says, I had an ideaan idea, founding the first micro computer software companyI'd say it was a pretty good idea and there's no magic to create tiviny and coming up with ideasIt's just doing some very simple things and I give lots of evidencePersist Joe Kraus says persistence is a number one reason for our successYou got to persist through failureYou got to persist through crap which of course means criticism rejection, asshole's, and pressureSo the big answer to this question is simplePay 4,000 bucks and come to TedOr failing that to the eight things and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to successThank you, teachers for all your interviewersThank youWith all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu, and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Drbrilliant later todayI want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, all of which are completely preventable for at least 95% of people just by changing diet and lifestyleAnd what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurringThe people are starting to eat like us and live like us and and dialectsAnd in one generation, for example, age has gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity in diabetes to one of the highestAnd in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countriesSo there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of little millions of people and practice preventive medicine on a global scaleHeart and blood of vessel disease is still kill more people not only in this country, but also worldwide than everything else combinedAnd yet, it's completely preventable for almost everybodyIt's not only preventable, it's actually reversibleAnd for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing died in live style, using these very high-tech expensive state-of-the-art measures to prove have powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like quantitative arteriography before and after a year and cardiac pet scansWe showed a few months ago, we published the first study showing that you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes and died in lifestyleAnd 70% regression in the tumor growth were inhibition of the tumor growth compared to only 9% in the control groupAnd in the MRI and the MR spectroscopy here, that prostate tumor activity is shown in redYou can see it diminishing after a yearNow, there isn't up a damn that KavobesityTwo-thirds of adults and 15% of kidsWhat's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70% in the past 10 yearsAnd this may be the first generation which are kids of a shorter lifespan than we doThat's pitiful and that's preventableNow, these are not election returnsThese are the number of people who are obese by state beginning in 85, 86, 87These are from the CDC website, 88, 89, 90, 91You get a new category, 92, 93, 94, 95, and 86, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2001It gets worseWe're kind of devolvingNow what can we do about this? Well, the diet that we found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet, but the people in Asia starting to, you know, like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we areSo I've been working with a lot of the big food companiesThey can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunch and convenient to eat healthier foodsLike I chair the advisor boards and McDonald's in PepsiCo and Conagrin, Safeway and soon Don MontyAnd they're finding that it's good businessthe salads that you see at McDonald's came from the workThey're going to have an Asian salad and PepsiTwo thirds of the revenue growth came from their better foodsAnd so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian fluThank youThank youAnyway, I am Michael Schermer, the director of the skeptics society, the publisher of skeptic magazine, we investigate claims of the paranormal pseudoscience and fringe groups and cults and claims of all kinds betweenScience and pseudoscience and non-science, junk science, voodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science and plain old nonsenseUnless you've been on Mars recently, you know, there's a lot of that out thereSome people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative turn, but let's face it, there's a lot of bunkAnd we are like the bunk of squads of the police departments out there flushing outWell, we're sort of like the Ralph Nader's of bad ideasTrying to replace bad ideas with good ideasI'll show you an example of a bad ideaI brought this with meThis was given to us by NBC Date Line to testIt's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West VirginiaIt's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser RodThis was being sold to high school administrators for $900 a pieceIt's a piece of plastic with a radio shack antenna attached to itYou can douse for all sorts of things, but this particular one was built to douse for marijuana in students' lockersSo the way it works is you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker and then you open the lockerSo it looks something like thisI'll show youAnd itOhWell, it has kind of a right leaning biasSo I'll show youWell, this is scienceSo we'll do a control experimentIt'll go this way for sureSir, you want to empty your pockets, please, sirSo the question was, can it actually find marijuana in student's lockers? And the answer is, if you open enough of them, yesBut in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits, and that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here is that this is how psychics work astrologers and tarot card readers and so onPeople remember the hits they forget the misses and scienceWe have to keep the whole database and look to see if the number of hits is somehow stands out from the total number that you would expect by chanceIn this case, we tested itWe had two opaque boxes, one with government approved THC Marijuana and one with nothingAnd it got it 50% of the timewhich is exactly what you'd expect with a coin-flip modelSo that's just kind of a fun little example here of the sorts of things we doSkeptic is the quarterly publicationEach one has a particular themeLike this one is on the future of intelligence, are people getting smarter or dumberI have an opinion of this myself because the business I'm inBut in fact, people turns out are getting smarterThree IQ points per 10 years going up sort of an interesting thingWith science, don't think of skepticism as a thing or even science as a thingour science and religion compatibleIt's like a science and plumbing compatibleThere are just two different thingsScience is not a thingIt's a verbIt's a way of thinking about thingsIt's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomenaI mean, what's more likely that extraterrestrial intelligence is a multidimensional beings travel across the vast distances of interstellar space to leave a cropped circle in farmer bodges fieldAnd Puckerbrush, Kansas to promote skepticcom or webpageOr is it more likely that a reader of skeptic did this with Photoshop? And in all cases, we have to ask, what's the more likely explanation? And before we say something is out of this world, we should first make sure that it's not in this worldWhat's more likely that Arnold had a little extra terrestrial help and is run for the governorship or that the world weekly news makes stuff upAnd part of that, the same theme is express nicely here in the Sydney Harris cartoonFor those of you in the back, it says here, then America occursI think you need to be more explicit here in step twoThis single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design argumentsThere's nothing more to it than thatYou can say a miracle occursIt's just that it doesn't explain anythingIt doesn't offer anythingThere's nothing to testIt's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationistsWhereas, and it's true, scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers, dark energy, or dark matter, or something like thatUntil we figure out what it is, we'll just call it thisIt's the beginning of the causal change for sciencefor intelligent design creationist at the end of the chainSo again, we can ask this what's more likely are UFOs, alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes? This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California, looking down over PasadenaAnd if it looks a lot like a Buecub cap, it's because it isYou don't even need PhotoshopYou don't need high-tech equipmentYou don't need computersThis was shot with a throwaway, codec, and schematic cameraYou just have somebody off on the side with a hub cap, ready to go, cameras ready, that's itSo although it's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on and that some of them are real, it's more likely that all of them are fake like the crop circlesOn a more serious note, in all of science, we're looking for a balance between data and theory, in the case of Galileo, he had two problems when he turned his telescope to SaturnFirst of all, there was no theory of planetary rings and second of while his data was grainy and fuzzy, and he couldn't quite make out what it was he was looking atSo he wrote that he has seen, I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodiesAnd this is what he ended up concluding that he sawSo without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data, you can't have a good theoryAnd it wasn't solved until 1655This is Christian Heigens book in which he catalogued all the mistakes that people made and trying to figure out what was going on with SaturnIt wasn't until Heigens had two thingshad a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated and then he had better telescopic more fine-grain data in which he could figure out that as the earth is going around faster according to Kepler's laws than SaturnThen we catch up with it and we see the angles of the rings at different angles there and that's in fact turns out to be trueThe problems with having a theory is that your theory may be loaded with cognitive biasesSo one of the problems of explaining why people believe where things is that we have things in a simple level and then I'll go to more serious onesLike we have a tendency to see facesThis is the face on Mars, which was in 1976, so there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area, because people thought this was monumental architecture made by MartiansWell, it turns out here's the close up of it from 2001If you squint, you can still see the faceAnd when you're squinting, what you're doing is you're turning that from fine grain to coarse grainAnd so you're reducing the quality of your dataAnd if I didn't tell you what to look for, You'd still see the face because we're programmed by evolution to see faces, faces are important for us sociallyAnd, of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to seeYou can see the happy face on Mars thereIf astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog, you see them there, little froggy legs, or geologists were elephantsReligious iconographyJust covered by a Tennessee Baker in 1996He charged five bucks ahead to come see the Nund buy and tell he got a cease and disissist from other trees his lawyerHere's our lady of Guadalupe and our lady of Watsonville down the streeters that up the street from hereTree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy, black and white splotchy, and you can get the pattern seeking humans or pattern seeking animalsHere's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in This is ApolloHere's the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich, which I got to actually hold in Las Vegas, Casino, of course, this is being AmericaThis Casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwichBut who does it really look like? The Virgin Mary has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s, there a lookVirgin Mary and Clearwater Florida actually went to see this oneThere was a lot of people there of the faithful come to be in their wheelchairs and crutches and so onWe went down and investigated, this gives you a size that's docked in me and the amazing Randy next to this two and a half story size imageAll these candles, so many thousands of candles, people had lit and tribute to thisSo we walked around the backside to see what was going on hereWe're at turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree you get the effectHere's a Virgin Mary on the backside which they started to wipe offI guess you can only have one miracle for buildingSo is it really a miracle of Mary or is it a miracle of Marge? And then I'm going to finish up with another example of this with AuditorialusionsThere's this film white noise with Michael Keaton about the dead talking back to usBy the way, this whole business of talking to the dead, it's not that big a deal anybody can do itTurns out it's getting the dead to talk backreally hard partIn this case supposedly these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena there's a reverse speechcom web page in which I downloaded this stuff here is the forward is the most famous one of all of these here's the forward version of the very famous song You can go back but in the long runAnd there's still time to playWell, I can just listen to that all dayAll right, here it is backwardsAnd see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in thereI'm going to get my boyfriends The world of happiness and the rest You can't grow in your dreams and sleep I'm all alone in my little self-lossed sleep What'd you get? Satan, okay, well at least we got to say itNow I will prime your auditory part of your brain to tell you what you're supposed to hear and then here it againI'm gonna be the best of all I've ever hadYou can't miss it when I tell you what's thereAll right, I'm just in with a positive, nice little story about the skeptics is a nonprofit educational organizationWe're always looking for little good things that people do in EnglandThere's a pop singer, very one of the top popular singers in England today, Katie MaluaAnd she read a beautiful songIt was in Top 5 in 1925 called 9 million bicycles in BeijingIt's a love storyShe sort of the Nora Jones of the UKAbout how much she loves her guy and compared to 9 million bicyclesAnd so forth, and she has this one passage hereI know that I will only be hereWell, that's niceAt least you got it closeIn America, it would be where 6,000 light years from the edgeBut my friend Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator and he wrote the book The Big Bang and so onHe uses every chance he gets to promote good scienceAnd so he wrote a op-ed piece in the Guardian about Katie Song in which he said, well, we know it's actually how far from the edge, You know, it's 137 billion light yearsAnd it's not a guessWe know within a precise error bars, they're close it isAnd so we can say, although not absolutely true, that it's pretty close to being trueAnd to his credit, Katie called them up after this op-ed piece came out and said, I'm so embarrassedI was a member of the Astronomy Club, and I should have known betterAnd she recut the song, so I will end with the new versionWe are 13 boys, 7 to the max From the edge of the observable universe That's a good estimate, we'll work as fun as ever And with the available information I predict that our room always be with you Our pool is there!I want to start off by saying Houston, we have a problemWe're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in spaceIn fact, we were dressedWe stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always doneAnd that is instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places and found out later, maybe to our surprise that that's the reason we survivedAnd I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's okay to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video and they need to look forward to explorationThey need to look forward to colonizationThey need to look forward to breakthroughsThey need to, we need to inspire them because they need to lead us in help us survive in the futureI'm particularly troubled that what NASA is doing right now with this new bush doctrine for this next decade and a hat of shoot, I screwed upWe have real specific instructions here, not to talk about politicsWhat we are looking forward to is what we're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children, but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country, the Boeing's and Lockheed Space Engineers, to go out and take risks and try new stuffWe're going to go back to the moon and move 50 years later, and we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything newI'm really troubled by thatAnyway, that's the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though, is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders laterThat's a theme of my next 15 minutes hereAnd I think that the inspiration begins when you're very youngThree year olds up to 12, 14 year oldsWhat they look at is the most important thingLet's take a snapshot at aviationAnd there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happenedStarted in 1908 when the Wright brothers flew in Paris and everybody said, Hey, I can do thatThere was only a few people that had flown in early 1908In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousands of pilotsAirplanes was invented by natural selectionNow, you can say that intelligent design designs are airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanesThere were probably at least 30,000 different things triedAnd when they crash and kill the pilot, I don't try that againThe ones that flew and landed okay, because there was no train pilots who were had good flying qualities by definitionSo we by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attemptsIn that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today, and that's why they're so safe as we gave it a lot of a lot of chance to find what's goodThat has not happened at all in space flying has only been two concepts tried two by the US and one by the RussiansWell, who was inspired during that time period aviation week asked me to make a list of who I thought or the movers and chargers of the first 100 years of aviation and I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful Renaissance of aviationWell, what happened when I was a little kid was, it was some pretty heavy stuff tooThe jet age startedThe missile age startedAnd Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars, and this was before SpudnikAnd this was at the time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is nowWe thought there'd be animals thereWe knew there were plants thereThe colors changed, right? But NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed only in the desertsThe, if you look at what happened, this is a black line, is as fast as man ever flewAnd the red line is the top of the line military fightersAnd the blue line is commercial air transportYou know, there's a big jump when I was a little kidAnd I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to tryWell, what did I do when I was a kid? I didn't do the hot rods and the girls in the dancing and well, we didn't have drugs in those daysBut I did competition model airplanesI spent about seven years there in a Vietnam word flight testing airplanes for the Air Force, and then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garagesAnd some 3,000 of these are flying, of course, one of them is around the world VoyagerI found another company in 82, which is my company now, and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart, the most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jetState and service, tell it was too rusty to fly and take an out of serviceWe retreated in 98 back to something that was developed in 56What? The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a grumant lunar landerIt was a land on the moon, take off in the moon, didn't need any maintenance guysThat's kind of coolWe've lost that capabilityWe banded it in 1972This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1960Well, three yearsAnd we can't do that nowCrazyTalk very briefly about innovation cyclesThings that grow have a lot of activityThey die out when they replace by something elseThese things tend to happen every 25 years, 40 years long with an overlap, you can put that statement on all kinds of different technologiesThe interesting thing, by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher speed travel is the title of these innovation cyclesThere is none hereThese two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958Here's the BiggieAnd that is you don't have innovation cyclesIf the government develops in the government, use itA good example, of course, is the DARPA netThe other computers were used for artillery first, then IRSBut when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from itPrivate sector has to do itKeep that in mindI put down innovationI've looked for innovation cycles in spaceI found noneThe very first year, starting when Gagarin went in spaceAnd a few weeks later, Alan Shepherd, There were five men's base flights in the world, a very first yearIn 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killedThere were only three or four flights in 2003In 2004, there were only two flights, two Russian Soyuz flights to the International Mendes Station, and I had to fly three in Mahave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five, which was the number the same year back in 1961There is no growth, there is no activity, there is no nothingThis is a picture here taken from spaceship one, this is a picture here taken from orbitOur goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy thatWe know how to do it for suborbital flying now, do it safe enough, at least as safe as the early airlines so that can be done and I think that I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small companyFirst of all, what's going to happen next? The first industry will be a high volumeA lot of players, there's another one announced just last week and it will be suborbitalAnd the reason it has to be subarbital is there is not solutions for atiquity to fly the public to orbitThe governments have been doing this three governments have been doing this for 45 years and still 4% of the people that left the atmosphere have diedAnd you know what to run a business with that kind of a safety recordIt will be very high volumeWe think a hundred thousand people will fly by 2020I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my scheduleBut I think once it does, we will find solutions and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit and that really easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon, so you have this cool viewAnd that'll be really cool, because the moon doesn't have an atmosphereYou can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feetIf you want it, oh, that's going to be so much funOkayMy critics say, hey, Routaine's just been in a lot of these billionaires money to for jury rights for billionairesWhat's this? And it's not transportation systemIt's just for funAnd I used to be bothered by thatAnd I got to thinking, well, wait a minuteI bought my first Apple computer in 1978And I bought it because I could say, I got a computer at my house and you don'tAnd what do you use it for? Come over it, it does froggerOK? Not the banks computer or lock-age computer, but the home computer was for gamesFor a whole decade, it was for funWe didn't even know what it was forBut what happened, the fact that we had this big industry, big development, big improvement in capability and so on, and they get out there and enough homes, We were right for a new inventionAnd the inventor is in this audienceAl Gore invented the internetAnd because of that, what something that we use for a whole year is give me whole decade for fun became everythingOur commerce, our research, our communicationAnd if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends, we can add, it doesn't more things to the listAnd it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homeSo fun is defendableOK, I want to show you kind of a busy chartBut it in it is my prediction with what's going to happenAnd in it also brings up another point, right here, there's a group of people that have come forwardAnd you don't know all of themBut the ones that have come forward were inspired As young children, this little three to 15 year old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time periodPaul Allen, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff BezosThe Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians suborbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station and KarmacThese people are taking money and putting it in an interesting areaAnd I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of better cell phone or somethingBut they're putting it in various areasAnd this will lead us into this kind of capabilityAnd it will lead us into the next really big thingAnd it'll allow us to exploreAnd I think eventually it'll allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinctThey were inspired by big progressBut look at the progress that's going on after thatThere were a couple of examples hereThe military fighters had a highest performance military airplane was the SR-71It went a whole life cycleGot too rusty to fly and was taken out of serviceThe Concord doubled the speed for airline travelIt went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of serviceAnd we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late 50sBut something is out there to inspire our kids nowAnd I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, if you've got a 10 year old nowWhat's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen hereRelatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplanesIt's never happened beforeThe fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes, why do you need something better? But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying suborbital flights to space, very soon, wait a minuteWhat's happening here? We'll have military fightersWhat suborbital capability, and I think very soon thisBut the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go firstOK, I look forward to a new capitalist space raceLet's call itRemember the space race in the 60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestonesWe didn't lose them technicallyThe fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it, you can argue that's not a technical lossSputnik was an technical loss, but it was a prestige lossAmerica, the world saw America as not being the leader, technologyAnd that was a very strong thingAnd then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagera, not months or decades or whateverSo we had the capability, but America lostWe lostAnd because of that, we made a big jump to recover itWell, again, it's interesting here as we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones alreadyYou cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in AmericaCan't do itYou can buy it in RussiaYou can fly with Russian hardwareThis is available because a Russian space program is starving, and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seatsIt's commercial, it's can be defined as space tourismThere are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done100 million bucks? Hey, go to the moonBut would you have thought back in the 60s when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do? Oh, do I have ticket to go to the moon? It would be an Russian hardwareAnd would you have thought, with the Russians have thought that when they first go to the moon and they're developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians, maybe it will probably be a Japanese or American billionaire? Well, that's weird, you know what really isBut anyway, I think we need to beat them againI think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful private spaceflight industryWhether we're first or not really doesn't matter, the Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the ConcordAnd then they flew a few cargo floods and took it out of serviceYou know, I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offeredOkay, I'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flightThis little thing says there are five times what NASA is doing by 2020I'll tell you already there's about a billion and a half to a billion point seven investment in private spaceflight that is not government at allAlready worldwideIf you read Google it you'll find about half of that money but there's twice of that being committed out thereNot spent yet but being committed and planned for the next few yearsHey, that's pretty bigI'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to beAnd it certainly is profitable when you fly people at $200,000 on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or lessThis is going to be very profitableI predict also that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the US taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft workAnd every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by factor of 10 to 15And what that means is before we know it, the progress in human spaceflight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flightAnd that is because it's us, it's private industryYou should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuffAnd we've done it for a long timeThe NACA before NASA never developed an airliner and never ran an airlineBut NASA is developing the space liner always has and runs the only space lineOK? And we've tried away from it because we are afraid of itBut starting back in June of 2004, when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, can get a start with itEverything changed after that timeOK, thank you very muchThank youI want to start with a story of a Seth Gauden from when I was 12 years oldMy uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater at this eye thoughtIt was beautifulIt had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru kind of right across the chest that were also fuzzyI wore it whenever I could thinking it was the most fabulous thing I ownedUntil one day in ninth grade when I was standing with a number of football players And my body had clearly changed and Matt Musselina who was undeniably my nemesis in high school said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips, but we could all ski on, now, no regretsAnd I'm so humiliated and mortified that he immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweaterWe drove to the good well and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniouslyMy idea being that I would never have to think about this sweater nor see it ever againFast forward, 11 years later, on the 25-year-old kid, working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopesWhen I see 10 feet in front of me, a little boy, 11 years old, running toward me wearing my sweaterAnd I'm thinking, no, this is not possibleBut so curious, I run up to the childOf course, scaring the living Vajizat out of him, grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there's my name written on the collar of this sweaterI tell that story because it has served and continues to serve as metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earthWe so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never knowI also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be that this traveled into the goodwill in Virginia and moved its way into the larger industry, which is that point was giving millions of tons of second-hand clothing to African Asia, which was a very good thing, providing low-cost clothingAnd at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industryNot to say that it shouldn't have, but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responsesSo I'm going to stick in Rwanda circa in 1985, 1986What I was doing two things, I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothersWe called the Bad News Bears and our notion was we were going to corner the Snackfood business in Kigali, which was not hard because there were no snacks before usAnd because we had a good business model, we actually did itAnd I watched these women transform on a micro levelBut at the same time, I started a microfinance bankAnd tomorrow, Ikbok Kadeer is going to talk about Grammene, which is the grandfather of all microfinance banks, which now is a worldwide movementYou talk about a memeBut then it was quite new, especially in a economy that was moving from barter into tradeWe got a lot of things rightWe focused on a business modelWe insisted on skin in the gameThe women made their own decisions at the end of the dayAs to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses, earn more income so they could take care of their families betterWhat we didn't understand, what was happening all around us with the confluence of fear, ethnic, strife, and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into this invisible, but certainly palpable movement inside Wandaat that time 30% of the budget was all far and eightThe genocide happened in 1994, seven years after these women all worked together to build this dreamAnd the good news was that the institution, the banking institution lastedIn fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the countryThe bakery was completely wiped outBut the lessons for me were that accountability counts, got to build things with people on the groundUsing business models were a Stephen level would say, The incentives matter, understand how ever complex we make be incentives matterSo when Chris raised to me, how wonderful everything that was happening in the world that we were seeing as shift in zeitgeistOn the one hand, I absolutely agree with himAnd I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bano and Bob Geldoff, the world is talking about global poverty, the world is talking about Africa and why I have never seen in my lifeIt's thrillingAnd at the same time, what keeps me up at night is a fear that will look at the victories of the G8, $50 billion in increased aid to Africa, $40 billion in reduced debt as the victory as more than chapter one, as our moral evolutionAnd in fact, what we need to do is see, that is chapter one, celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution, all about the how-toAnd if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor in ways that are financially sustainable and scalableIf we do that, we really can make poverty historyAnd it was that whole philosophy that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called Acumen Fund, which is trying to build some mini-blue prints for how we might do that in water, health, and housing, in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania, and EgyptAnd I want to talk a little bit about that and some of the examples, so you can see what it is that we're doingBut before I do this, and this is another one of my pet food peeps, I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are, because we too often talk about the Mesdias, strong, huge masses of people, you're earning to be freeWhen in fact, it's quite an amazing storyOn a macro level, 4 billion people on Earth make less than $4 a dayThat's who we talk about when we think about the fourIf you aggregated it to the third largest economy on Earth, then you have most of these people go invisibleWhere we typically work as people making between $1 and $3 a dayWho are these people? They are farmers and factory workersThey work in government officesThey're driversThey are domesticThey typically pay for critical goods and services like water, like healthcare, like housingAnd they pay 30 to 40 times with their middle class counterparts, payCertainly, where we work in Karachi and NairobiThe poor also are willing to make and do makes smart decisions if you give them that opportunitySo two examplesOne is in India where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than $2 a dayWhere we work in a Rangabad, the land is extraordinarily parsedYou see people on average making 60 cents to a dollarThis scyam pink is a social entrepreneur name AmitabaWhat he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches, and figure out how to trip irrigation, which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stockBut previously, it's only been created for large scale farmsSo Amitabha took this and modularized it down to a eighth of an acre, a couple of principles, build small, make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poorThis family, Serita and her husband bought a $15 unit when they were living in a literally a three-walled lane two with a corrugated iron roofAfter one harvest, they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter acreA couple years later, I meet themThey now make $4 a day, which is pretty much middle class, and they showed me the concrete foundationThey just laid to build their houseWhen I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes, something I truly believeYou can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria beddets, And I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rageFor $5, you can save a lifeMalaria's disease that kills 1 to 3 million people a year, 300 to $5 million cases are reportedIt's estimated that Africa loses about $13 billion a year to the disease$5 can save a lifeWe can send people to the moonWe can see if there's life on MarsWhy can't we get $5 net to $500 million? The question though is not, why can't we? The question is, how can we help Africans do this for themselves? A lot of hurdlesOne production is too low, two prices too highThree, this is a good roadAnd right near where our factory is located, the distribution is a nightmareBut not impossibleWe started by making a $350,000 loan to the largest traditional bednet manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer a technology from Japan and build these long lasting five year netsHere are just some pictures of the factoryToday, three years later, the company has employed another thousand womenIt contributes about $600,000 in wages to the economy of Tanzania, the largest company in TanzaniaThe throughput rate right now is 15 million nets, 3 million by the end of the yearWe hope to have 7 million at the end of next yearSo the production side is workingOn the distribution side though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do right now, 95% of these nets are being bought by the UN, and then given primarily to people around AfricaWe're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa people, their womenAnd so I want you to meet Jacqueline, my name'sake, 21 years oldIf she were born anywhere else, but Tanzania, I'm telling you she could run Wall StreetShe runs two of the lines and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her houseShe makes about $2 a dayIt's creating an education fund and told me she is not marrying or having children until these things are completedAnd so when I told her about our idea that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to othersShe quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed upWe took a lesson from IDO, one of our favorite companies, and quickly did a prototyping on thisAnd took Jacqueline into the area where she livesShe brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets $5 a piece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy oneAnd we learned a lot about how you sell things, not coming in with our own notionsbecause she didn't even talk about malaria until the very endFirst, she talked about comfort, status, beautyThese, and that, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your houseChildren can sleep through the nightThe house looks beautifulYou hang them in the window, and we've started making curtains, and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status that you care about your childrenOnly then did she talk about saving your children's livesA lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poorI want to end just by saying that there's a non-ass opportunity to make poverty historyTo do it right, we have to build business models that matter, that are scalable, and that work with Africans, Indians, people all over the developed in the world who fit in this category, to do it themselvesBecause at the end of the day, it's about engagement, it's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, but they want to make their own decisions they want to solve their own problems and that by engaging with them, not only do we create much more dignity for them but for us as wellAnd so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have to make poverty history by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us and them world and realizing that it's about all of us and the kind of world that we together want to live it in shareThank youThank youRight, thank you18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in right at the point where I get this thing to workHere we goI'm going to talk about five different thingsI'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirableI'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together and actually talk about this a bit more than we doI'm going to talk about feasibility as well of courseI'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about agingThen I'm going to spend perhaps a second half of the talk talking about how we might actually be able to prove that our fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about itI'm going to do that in two stepsThe first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension, which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people who are already in middle-aged when you start, to appoint which can genuinely be called defeating aging, namely essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year, or indeed to get sick in the first placeAnd of course the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years, life extensionSo I'm going to start with why we shouldNow I want to ask a question, hands up, anyone in the audience who is in favor of malariaThat was easyOkay, hands up, okay, hands up, anyone in the audience is not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thingOkay, so we often malaria is a bad thingThat's very good news because I thought that would be answered would beNow the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria, that it shares with agingAnd here is that characteristicI mean, the only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria doesI like an audience in Britain, especially to talk about the comparison with Foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle by the government, not very many months agoI know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logicThis is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to meA lot of people said, well, you know, it's that city boys have no business telling us or telling us rural types what to do with our timeIt's a traditional part of the way of life, and we shouldn't be, which should be that carry on doing itIt's ecologically sound, it's top to population explosion of foxesBut ultimately, the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the British public and certainly the majority of members of parliament came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilised societyAnd I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spadesWhat part of this do people not understand? It's not just about life, of courseIt's about healthy lifeGetting frail and miserable independent is no funWhether or not dying, maybe funSo really, this is what a little highlighted describedIt's a global chanceThese are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for agingAnd I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valuelessThere are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that nothing goes too well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix agingBut these are completely crazyWhen you actually, remember your sense of proportionYou know, these are argumentsThese are things that you have a legitimate, it would be legitimate to be concerned aboutBut the question is, are they so dangerous these risks of doing something about aging that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite namely leaving aging as it is? Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early deathYou know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, it's what I sayNow, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strongAnd here it isPeople worry about overpopulationThey say, well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing StGiles, Calis, and therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids and kids are really important to most peopleAnd that's trueAnd a lot of people try to find this question and give answers like thisI don't agree with those answersI think they basically don't workI think it's true that we will face a dilemma in this respectWe will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rateThe high death rate will of course arise from simply rejecting these therapies and in favor of carrying on having a lot of kidsAnd I say that that's fineThe future of humanity is entitled to make that choicewhat's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the futureIf we isolate and hesitate and do not actually develop these therapies, then we are condemning a whole cohort of people who would have been young and have been healthy enough to benefit from those therapies, but will not be because we haven't developed them as quickly as we couldWe will be denying those people in indefinite lifespan, and I'd consider that that is immoralThat's my answer to the other population questionRight, so the next thing is, know why should we get a little bit more active on thisAnd the fundamental answer is that the proaging trans is not as dumb as it looksIt's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of agentsAging is ghastly, but it's inevitableSo we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do to do thatLike, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after allBut of course, that only works when we have both of these componentsAnd as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear, and we might be in range of doing something about ageing, this becomes part of the problemThis pro-aging France is what stops us from meditating about these thingsAnd that's why we have to really talk about this a lot of antilies, I will let have our eyes to say, quite a lot, in order to get people's attention and make people realize that they are in a chance in this regardSo that's what I'm going to say about itAnd I'm not going to talk about feasibilityAnd the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable is some in a definition of aging that I'm giving hereA very simple definition, aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolitesI mean, this is not a completely total logical statementIt's a reasonable statementAging is a basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars, and it also happens to us, despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfectSo basically metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effectsThose side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathologyThat's a fine definitionSo we can put it this wayWe can say that we have this chain of eventsAnd there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing agingThough, while I'm going here, the gerontology approach and the geriatric approach, the geriatrician will intervene late in the day when pathology is becoming evidentThe geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite soonOf course, it's a very short termist tragedyIt's a losing battle because the things that are causing the pathology of a coming more abundant as time goes onThe gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface because it's, you know, prevention is better than cureBut unfortunately, the thing is that we don't understand the table is very wellIn fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms workEven selves, we're not ready to go down the edgediscover things like, for example, RNA interferenceOnly a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells workBasically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about interventionSo then, what we do about that? I mean, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it? But it isn'tBefore I tell you why, it isn'tI'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step twoJust the pose, as I said, that we do acquireLet's say we do it today for second argumentThe ability to confer 30 extra year of healthy life on people who are already in middle days, let's say 55I'm going to call that robust human redefinitionWhat would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today, or, equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapy to arrive, would actually live? In order to answer that question, you might think it's simple, but it's not simpleWe can't just say, well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longerThat's the wrong answerAnd the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progressThere are two sorts of technological progress, really, for this purposeThere are fundamental major breakthroughs and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughsNow, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time framesFundamental breakthroughs, very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthroughThe very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun and it took us in until 1903 to actually work out how to do itBut after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniformI think these are, this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flightWe can think really that each one is beyond the imagination of the inventors of the previous one, if you likeIt's sort of the incremental advances that add up to something which is not incremental anymoreThis is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthroughAnd you see it in all sorts of technologiesComputing, if you can look at a more or less parallel timeline happened a bit laterYou can look at medical careI mean, hygiene, vaccine, antibiotics, the same sort of time frameSo I think that actually, step two, that I call a step a moment ago, isn't a step at allThat in fact, the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapy to ride will be at some sort of costThey will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments, but we'll give them a further 30 or maybe 50 yearsIn other words, they will be staying ahead of the gameThey will be, the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with usThis is a very important point to me to get across because most people when they hear that I predict that a lot of people are live today are going to live to 1,000 or moreThey think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to a thousand and moreI'm not saying that at allI'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enoughThey'll never be perfectBut we'll be able to fix the things that 200 year old dial before we have any 200 year oldAnd the same for 300 and 400 and so onI've decided to give this a little name, which is on devotee escape velocityAnd it seems to get the point acrossSo these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy, as measured by their healthIf a given age is that they were at the time that these therapies arrive, if you're already a hundred or even if you're 80 and average 80 a year old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies because you're too close to their store for the really initial experimental therapies to be good enough for youYou won't be able to withstand themBut if you're only 50, then the chance that you might be able to pull out of the diveAnd eventually, eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger, in a meaningful sense, in terms of your usefulness, for a physical and mental, in terms of your risk of death from age-related causesAnd of course, if you're younger than that, then you're not going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causesSo this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150 year old, we don't know how old that person is today because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first generation therapiesBut irrespective of that age, I'm claiming that the first person to live to a thousand subject of course to global catastrophes is actually probably only about 10 years younger than the first 150 year old and that's quite a thoughtAll right, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk I lost seven and a half minutesOn step one, namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to a scalability? And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bitI have a corresponding milestone to robust human redevelopenationI'm calling it robust mouse redevelopenation, not very imaginativelyAnd this is what it isI say we're going to take a long live strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on averageWe do exactly nothing to them until they were already two years oldAnd then we do a whole bunch of stuff to themAnd with those therapies, we get them to live on average to their fifth birthdaySo in other words, we add two yearsWe travel their remaining lifespan, starting from the point that we started the therapiesThe question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestoneI talked about earlier for humans, which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently, call either robust human redevenation or longevity escape velocityAnd the second one is it means for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things starting from the time we get the miceAnd thirdly, the question is what will it do to actually how much people want it? And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question and it's extremely hard to answerOne has to be very speculative and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply, hold a keep our counsel until we know moreI say that's nonsenseI say we are absolutely irresponsible if we stay silent on thisWe need to give our best guests as to the timeframes in order to give people a sense of progress and so that they can assess their prioritiesSo I say that we have a 50-50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human redevenation within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mass redevenation15 years from the robust massThe public's perception will probably be somewhat better than thatThe public tend to underestimate how difficult scientific things areSo they'll probably think it's five years awayThey'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too muchAnd finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public of science, Biblin to about aging now, is the global trans, I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy, that will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans, since it's been postponed so very effectively in miceSo we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes, and of course, that has enormous implicationsSo in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of agingI'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually caused pathologyBecause the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually caused pathology, the damage itself is caused ongoingly throughout life starting before we're bornBut it is not part of metabolism itselfAnd this turned that to be useful because we can redraw our original diagram this wayWe can say that fundamentally the difference between georontology and georiactic is that Daryntology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damageAnd I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological turns in a momentAnd Daryretrition tries to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathologyAnd the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulateSo there's a third approach, if we look at it this wayWe can call it the engineering approachAnd I claim that the engineering approach is within rangeThe engineering approach does not intervene in any processIf not intervening, this process or this one, and that's good because it means that it's not alerting battle and it's something that we are within range of being able to do because it doesn't involve improving on evolutionThe engineering approach simply says, let's go in and periodically repair all of these various types of damageNot necessarily rather than completely, but repair them quite a lot so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenicWe know that this threshold exists because we don't get a delay he disease until we're in mid-late, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were bornWhy do I say that we're in-range? Well, this is basically itThat's the point of that this slide is actually the bottomIf we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for ageing, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for ageing in one way or anotherThis list is just for illustration, it is incompleteThe list is on the rightIt is also incompleteIt's a list of types of pathology that are educated and is just an incomplete listBut I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually completeThis is the list of types of things that qualify as damage, side effects of metabolism and blood cause pathology in the end or that might cause pathologyAnd there are only seven of themThey're quite a category of things, of courseBut there's only seven of themSo loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondrial and so onAnd first of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is completeOf course, one can make a biological argument what can say, okay, what are we made of? We made of cells and stuff between cellsWhat can damage accumulate in the answer is, long-lived molecules, because if I thought if molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed, like by a protein being destroyed by proteologists, then the damage is gone tooIt's got to be long-lived moleculesSo these seven things were all under discussion in derontorentory a long time agoAnd that is pretty good news, because it means that we've come a long way in biology in these 20 yearsSo the fact that we haven't had extended this list is pretty good indication that there's no extension to be doneHowever, it's better than thatWe actually know how to fix them all in mice in principleAnd what I mean by in principle is we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decadeSome of them are partially implemented already that ones at the topI haven't got time to go through them at all, but if we can, my conclusion is that if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mass redevelopenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about itWe do need to really start tryingSo of course there is a biologist in the audience and you see I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may haveYou may have been dissatisfied with this talk but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuffI've published a great deal on thisI cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based and there's quite a lot of detail thereThe detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive of time friends that I'm predicting hereSo if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better done well, go and find out why you think I'm wrongAnd of course, the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves geologist because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you expect people not people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriouslySo you've got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is trueI will just answer with a few thingsOne thing is you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said, sometimes a guy that he could sequence the human genome in half no timeAnd everyone said, well, it's obviously impossibleAnd you know what happenedSo this does happenWe have various strategiesThere's the material of the mass prize, which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do what you think is going to workAnd you get money for it, if you winThere's a proposal to actually put together an instituteThis is what's going to take a bit of moneyBut I mean, look, how long did it take to spend that on the war in Iraq? Not very longOK? It's got to be philanthropic because profits distract biotechBut it's basically got a 90% chance, I think, of succeeding in thisAnd I think we now have to do itAnd I'll stop thereThank youAPPLAUSE All rightI don't know if there's going to be any questions, but I thought there could be for the chancesince you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat itWhy is it that you make yourself appear like an old man? Look at thatLAUGHTER Because I am an old man, I am actually a 150-eighth, I am sureLAUGHTER APPLAUSE Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate, however, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually dieSo when cells divide the telomeras, get shot, and eventually species dieSo why does evolution have seems to have selected against immortality when it is so advantageous? Or is evolution just incomplete? BrilliantThank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answerI'm going to tell you the general, the genuine mainstream answer to your question, which I happen to agree with, which is that no, aging is not a product of selectionEvolution is simply a product of evolutionary neglectIn other words, we have aging because it's hard work, not to have agingYou need more genetic pathway, more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowlyThat carries on being true, the longer you put it outSo to the extent that it doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation, there's a certain amount of modulation of that, which is why different species have different lifespans, but that's why there are no mortal speciesThe jeans don't care, but we doThat's rightHelloI read summer that in the last 20 years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet as grown by 10 yearsIf I project that, that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don't crash from my motorbikeThat means that I'm one of your subjects to become a thousand year oldIf you lose a bit of weight, you're numbers are a bit outThe standard numbers are that life spans been growing up between one and two years per decadeSo it's not quite as good as you might thinkYou might hopeBut I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possibleI was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo, and that the brain cells last 80 years or soIf that is indeed true biologically, are there implications in the world of rejuvenation? If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years as opposed to typical, you know, a couple of months? There are technical implications certainlyBasically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells that are respectable right, especially neuronsBut we don't want to replace them any faster than that or not much faster anyway because we're about to be in them too fast would degrade cognitive functionWell, I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on, with a little bit of an oversimplification that there are species that have no aging, hydrophilic example, but they do it by not having another systemAnd not having any tissue in fact that relies for their function on very long-lived cells, that live more or less indefinitelyThat's here for Aubrey DegreeThank youThank youI'm going to make a video of the music music music I'm going to make a little more of the soundI'm going to make a little more of the soundI'm going to make a little more of the soundmusic music Thank you very muchI like to speak your book for meI am a TED version, I guessI'm also the first time hereAnd I don't know what to sayI'm really happy that MrAnderson invited meI'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyoneAnd the song that I just played was by Joseph HoffmanIt's called KlaidoscopeAnd Hoffman is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th centuryAnd he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all timeI have another piece that I'd like to play for youIt's called Obeg variations by Robert Schumann, a German 19th century composerThe name Obeg is actually AB, EGG, and that's the main theme and the melodyThat comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friendsBut he wrote that for his wifeSo actually if you listen carefully, there's supposed to be five variations on this object themeIt's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like itThank youThank youThank youThank youThank youI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itI'm not sure if you can see itThank youmusic Thank youThank youmusic music Thank youNow comes the part that I hateWell, because MrAnderson told me that this session is called sync and flow, I was wondering, what do I know that these geniuses don't? So I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to startWhy do I compose? I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to composeWhat I do first is I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the obit that you just heardAnd once I choose my main theme, I have to decide out of all the styles of music, what kind of style do I wantAnd this year I compose a romantic styleSo for inspiration, I listened to List and Tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composersNext, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachersThey help me plan out the whole pieceAnd then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas because then you have to thinkAnd then when the piece takes somewhat of a solid-fied form, so let it findSo let it find formYou're supposed to actually polish the details and then polish the overall performance of the compositionAnd another thing that I enjoy doing is drawingDrawing because I like to draw Japanese anime artI think that's a crazy among teens right nowAnd once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing, it's your characterYou want to decide who do you want to draw? Or if you want to draw an original characterAnd then you want to decide how are you going to draw the character? Am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer? I'm going to use two page spread, like a comic book, for more grandiose effect, I guessAnd then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is your structure of a pieceAnd then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need, that's polishing the drawingAnd another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mindBecause I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distractedSo if I'm trying to do homework, if I'm trying to do homework, and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or waste my timeAnd then what happens is sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at allAnd then it's like there's too much on your mindYou can't focus on what you're supposed to doAnd sometimes if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturallyWhat happens is, if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider flow, because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anythingYou feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you wantI'm not going to play my own composition today because although I did finish it, it's way too longInstead, I'd like to try something called improvisationI have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet and I'd like someone to come up here and choose fiveAnyone to come up here and choose five and then I can make it into some sort of melody and I'll improvise itWow, a volunteer yay! Let's do it to youThank youThank youUm, okayI guess five cardsYes, five cardsAny five cards?

Well, I can't my iPad, so it's not an computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with thatSo I didn't have a research on itWell, this is what I found, because I hope I can memorize itWell, I basically made a wood box and four-mails from the playing industry in the street, my bits and printers are the same waySo I'm passes to a piece of wood card bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplifiedBut, let me thinkOkayOn the other hand, we're placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard, can the string length, that's changed, it's the same wayOh my goshOkayThis is sort of a technology, but I can call it a 16-century technology, but actually the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system, I'm not going to leave the way the machine out isI still basically stand this in principle of producing a project in a sandIsn't that cool? YeahI'm sorryI'm sorryDesignI am lowIt's designI remember when I was little, my mom asked me, would you like to play the violin or the piano? I looked up a giant monsterI'm just a violin or the pianoI looked up a giant monster and said to myself, I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole dayThis is not in weight weight that I can play from standing, sitting for walkingAnd you know what?

or based on the same modelEntertainment, I love the entertainmentBut actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertainingI mean, when I first got my violin, and tried to play around it, it was actually really bad because I imagine in selling the way here from other kids, so horrible and so scratchySo, Zer, turning it offBut, besides my book, found this very funYeah, yeah,

YeahBut 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate studentsThat was after having spent about 20 years together with African institutions studying Hungarian AfricaSo I was sort of expected to know a little about the worldAnd I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, and I'm the graduate course called Global HealthBut when you get that opportunity, you get little nervousI thought these students coming to us actually have the highest gradeYou can get in Swedish college systemsSo I thought maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them aboutSo I did a pre-test when they cameAnd one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one, which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairsAnd I put them together so that in each pair of country, one has twice the child mortality of the otherAnd this means that it's much bigger the difference than the uncertainty of the dataI won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan, and South AfricaAnd these were the results of the Swedish studentsI did it, so I got a confidence interval, which was pretty narrow, and I got happy, of courseI won't point eight right answer out of five possibleThat means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my courseBut one night late night when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discoveryI have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzeesBecause the chimpanzee would score half rightIf I gave them to bananas with a slank and turkey, they would be right off of the casesBut the students are not thereThe problem for me was not ignoranceIt was preconceived ideasI did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolian's Game Institute that hands out the Nobel Prize in medicine, and they are on par with a chimpanzee thereSo this is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well awareSo we did the software which displays it like thisEvery bubble here is a countryThis country over here is ChinaAnd this is IndiaThe size of the bubble is the populationAnd on this axis here, I put fertility rateBecause my students, what they said, when they looked upon the worldAnd I asked them, what do you really think about the world? I first discovered that the textbook was tintin mainlyAnd they said, the world is still we and themAnd we is Western world, and them is third worldAnd what do you mean with Western world? I said, well, that's long life in small familyAnd third world is short life in large familySo this is what I could display hereI put fertility rate hereNumber of children per woman, 1, 2, 3, 4 up to about eight children per womanWe have very good data since 1962, 1960, about on the size of families in all countriesThe era margin is narrowHere I put life expectancy at birth from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years, and 1962, that was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries, and they had small families and long livesAnd these were the developing countriesThey had large families, and they had relatively short livesNow what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change of the students' rightIt's still two types of countries, or have these developing countries got smaller families, and they live here, We have the got longer lives and live up thereLet's see, we start the worldAnd this is all UN statistic that has been availableHere we goCan you see there? It's China, they're moving them against better health, they're improving thereAll the green, Latin American countries, they are moving towards smaller familiesYou're yellow ones here are the Arabic countries and they get larger familiesBut no, longer lives, but not larger familiesThe Africans are the green down here, they're still remain hereThis is Indonesia's moving on PityfestAnd in the 80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries there, but now Bangladesh, it's a miracle that happens in the 80sThe Imam start to promote family planning and then move up into that corner and in 90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of the world moves up into the corner where we have long lives and small family and we have a complete new worldLet me make a comparison directly between United States of America and Vietnam1964America had small families and long lifeVietnam had large families and short livesAnd this is what happensthe data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancyBy the end of the year, the family planning started in Vietnam and they went for smaller families and the United States up there is getting for longer life, keeping family sizeAnd in the 80s now, they give up communist planning and they go for market economy and it moves faster even in the social lifeAnd today we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam in 1923 as in United States 1974 by the end of the warI think we all, if we don't look in the data, we underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economical changeSo let's move over to another way here, in which we could display the distribution in the world of the incomeThis is the world distribution of income of people$1, $10 or $100 per dayThere's no gap between rich and poor and a longerThis is a mythThat's a little humpierBut there are people all the wayAnd if we look where the income ends up, the income, this is 100% of the world's annual incomeAnd the richest 20% they take out of that about 74%, and the poorest 20% they take about 2%And this shows that the concept developing countries is extremely doubtfulWe sort of think about aid like these people here, giving aid to these people hereBut in the middle, we have most of the world populationAnd they have now 24% of incomeWe heard it in other formsAnd who are these? where are the different countries? I can show you AfricaThis is Africa10% of world population, most in povertyThis is OECD, the rich country, the country club of the UNAnd they are over here on this sideAnd quite an overlap between Africa and OECDAnd this is Latin AmericaIt has everything on this earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin AmericaAnd on top of that, we can put East Europe, We can put East Asia and we could South AsiaAnd how did it look like if we go back in time to about 1970? Then there was more of a humpAnd we have most who lived in absolute poverty were AsiansThe problem in the world was the poverty in AsiaAnd if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increase, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others get into povertyAnd this is the pattern we have today and the best projection from the world bank is that this will happenAnd we will not have a divided worldWe will have most people in the middleOf course, it's a logarithmic scale hereBut our concept of economy is growth with percentWe look upon it as a possibility of percent that will increaseIf I change this and I take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic productAnd I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the populationAnd you have the OECD there, and you have sub-seharent Africa thereAnd we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axisAnd I can give it a new dimension here by adding the social values there, shine survivalNow I have money on that axis and I have the possibility of children to survive thereIn some countries 997% of children survived to 5 years of age, others on the 70And here it seems that this is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Sarren AfricaThe linearity is very strong between child survival and moneyBut let me split sub-Sarren AfricaHeels is there and better is up thereI can go here and I can split sub-Sare in Africa into its countriesAnd when it bursts, the size of East Comkrie bubble is the size of the populationSierra Leone down there, Mauritius up thereMauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers and they could sell their sugar, they could sell their textiles on equal terms as the people in Europe and North AmericaThere's a huge difference between Africa and Ghana is here in the middleIn Sierra Leone, a humanitarian aid here in Uganda, development aid, here time to invest there you can go for holidayIt's a tremendous variation within Africa, which we very often make that it's equal everythingI can split South Asia here, India is the big bubble in the middle, but huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri LankaAnd I can split Arab states, how are they? same climate, same culture, same religion, huge difference, even between neighbors, Yemen, civil war, United Arab Emirate money, which was quite equally and well-used, not as the mythistsAnd that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the countryData is often better than you thinkMany people say data is badThere's an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here, Cambodia, SingaporeThe differences are much bigger than the weakness of the dataEast Europe, Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out of the 10 years very, very differentlyAnd there is Latin AmericaToday we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin AmericaChile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from nowAnd here we have high income companies in OECD, and we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like thisAnd if we look at it, how it looks the world in 1960, it starts to move, 1960This is Mount SittungHe brought health to ChinaAnd then he diedAnd then, then, the European came and brought money to China and brought them into the mainstream againAnd we have seen how countries move in different directions like thisSo it's sort of difficult to get an example country, which shows the pattern of the worldBut I would like to bring you back to about here at 1960And I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one, the label went away from me hereAnd I would like to compare Uganda, which is thereAnd I can run it forward like thisAnd you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement whereas Brazil is much slowerAnd if we move back again here and we put on trails on them like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very differentAnd the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and healthBut it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy firstAnd to show that you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates, they came from hereA mineral country, they catch all the oil, they got all the money, but health cannot be bought at the supermarketYou have to invest in health, you have to get kids into schooling, you have to train health staff, you have to educate the population, and shakes I added that in a fairly good wayAnd in spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up hereSo we got a much more mainstream appearance of the world where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the pastNow, this is more or less if you look at average data of the countriesThey are like thisNow, that's dangerous to use average data because there's such a lot of difference within countriesSo if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda, that today is where South Korea was 1960If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within UgandaThese are the quintiles of UgandaThe richest 20% of Uganda's are thereThe poorest are down thereIf I split South Africa, it's like thisAnd if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine, lostlyIt's like thisThe 20% poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20% richest of South Africa is thereAnd yet, we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in AfricaEverything in this world exists in AfricaAnd you can't discuss universal access to HIV for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down hereThe improvement of the world must be highly contextualizedand it's not relevant to have it on regional levelWe must be much more detailedWe find that students get very excited when they can use thisAnd even more policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changingNow, why doesn't this take place? Why are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nation in the national statistical agencies and in universities in other non-governmental organizations because the data is hidden down in the databasesAnd the public is there, and the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectivelyAll that information we're so changing in the world does not include publicly funded statisticsThere are some web pages like this, you know? But they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statisticsAnd this won't workSo what does need it? We have the databasesIt's not a new database you needWe have wonderful design tools and more and more I added up hereSo we started a nonprofit venture, which we called linking data to this signWe call it gapminder from London underground, where they warn you, mind the gapSo we thought gapminder was a profitAnd we started the right software, which could link the data like thisAnd it wasn't that difficultIt took some person years and we have produced animationsYou can take a data set and put it thereWe are liberating you and dataSome few you and organizationsSome countries accept that the databases can go out on the worldBut what we really need is of course a search function, a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the worldAnd what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology on the main statistical unitsEveryone says it's impossibleThis can't be doneOur information is so peculiar and detailedSo that cannot be searched as other can be searchedWe cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the worldBut this is what we would like to see, isn't it? The publicly funded data is down hereAnd we would like flowers to grow out on the netAnd one of the crucial points is to make them searchable and then people can use the different design to animate it thereAnd I have a pretty good news for youI have a good news that the present new head of UN statistic, he doesn't say it's impossibleHe only says we can't do itAnd that's a quite clever guySo we can see a lot happening in data in the coming yearsWe will be able to look at income distributions in completely new waysThis is the income distribution of China 1970This is the income distribution of the United States 1970Almost no overlapAlmost no overlapAnd what has happened? What has happened is this, the China is growingIt's not so equal any longerAnd it's appearing hereOverlooking the United States almost like a ghost, isn't it? It's pretty scaredBut I think it's very important to have all this informationWe need really to see itAnd instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the internet users per 1,000And this software we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easilyIt takes some time to change for thisthis, but on the axis you can quite easily get any variable you would like to haveAnd the thing would be to get up the databases free to get them searchable and with a second click to get them into the graphic formats where you can instantly understand themNow the statisticians doesn't like it because they say that this will not show the realityhave to have statistical analytical methodsBut this is hypothesis generatingI end now with a world where the internet are coming, the number of internet users are going up like thisThis is the GDP per capitaAnd it's a new technology coming in, but in the amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countriesThat's why the $100 computer will be so importantBut it's a nice tendencyIt's as if the world is flattening offIsn't it? these countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded dataThank you very muchThank youThank youThank youIf you're here today and I'm very happy that you are, you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselvesHowever, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York CityAnd that's because most people with decision-making powers in both the public and the private sector really don't feel as though they're in dangerThe reason why I'm here today in part is because of a dogAnd a abandoned puppy I found back in the rain back in 1998She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I had anticipatedOnce she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility that the plan from the East River WaterfrontDespite the fact that our small part of New York City was already handled more than 40% of the entire city's commercial waste, a sewage treatment, palatizing plant, a sewage sludge, plant for power plants, the world's largest food distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each weekThe area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the citySo when I was contacted by the parks department, about a $10,000 seed gran initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning but a bit naiveI lived in this area all my life and then you could not get to the river because of all of a lovely facilities that I had mentioned earlierThen while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dumpThere were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me and low and behold that the end of that lot was the riverI knew that this forgotten little street end, a ban and like the dog that brought me there, was worth savingAnd I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South BronxAnd just like my new dog, was an idea that got bigger than I'd imaginedWe garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park of the South Bronx that had in more than 60 yearsWe leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times into a $3 million parkAnd in the fall, I'm actually going to exchange marriage vows with my belovedThank you very muchThank youThank youThank youThank youThank youThat's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the timeBut those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mineWe feel the problem is right now and have for some timeEnvironmental justice for those of you who may not be familiar with the term goes something like thisNo community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any otherWe're looking at the most important person in AmericaWe're looking at the most important person in AmericaWe're looking at the most important person in AmericaWe're looking at the most important person in AmericaWe're looking at the most important person in AmericaWe're looking at the most important person in AmericaWe're looking at the most important person in Americaand asmaWhy would someone leave their home to go for a risk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27% obesity rate is high even for this country and diabetes comes with itOne out of four South Bronx children has asthmaAsma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national averageThese impacts are coming everyone's way and we all paid dearly for solid waste costsHealth problems associated with pollution and more odiouslyThe cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men who possess untold amounts of of untap potential50% of our residents live at or below the poverty line25% of us are unemployedLow-income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary careThis comes in a high-cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefitsPoor people are not only still poor, they are still healthyUnfortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short-term and won't destroy us all in the long termNone of us want that and we all have that in commonSo what else do we have in common? First of all, we're all incredibly good lookingUmGraduated high school college, postgraduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable to never been imprisonedOkay, goodBut besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other waysI watch nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burned downMy big brother, Lynne, fought in Vietnam only to be gunned down a few blocks for the wholeJesus, I grew up with a crack house across the streetYeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghettoThese things make me different from youBut the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my communitybetween these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice and the otherSo how do things get so different for us? In the late 40s my dad, a poem in port of Son of a slave bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later he married my momAt the same at the time the community was a mostly white working class neighborhoodMy dad was not alone and it's others liked him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the countryRedlining was used by banks where in certain sections of the city including hours were deemed off limits to any sort of investmentMany landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditionsDead or injured former tenants notwithstandingHunts Point was formerly a walk to work communityBut now residents had neither work nor home to walk to a national highwayconstruction boom was added to our problemsIn New York State, Robert Moses, spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaignOne of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to ManhattanThe South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chanceResidents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were raised, 600,000 people were displacedThe common perception was it only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South BronxAnd if you are told from your earliest days, that nothing good is going to come from your community that is bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now my family's property was worthlessSay for the, it was our home and all we hadAnd luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors, and friends along the way, was enoughNow why is the story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation but gets environmental degradation, which gets social degradationThe disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come, antiquated zoning and land use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhoodAre these factors taken into consideration when land use policy is decided? What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify the local community goes through? This was planning in quotes that did not have our best interest in mineOnce we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planningThat small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a green way movement in the South BronxI wrote a one and quarter million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfall and esplanade with dedicated on street bypassPhysical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which have done probably don't compromise the community's quality of life, they provide opportunities for to be more physically active as well as local economic developmentThink bike shops, juice standsWe secure $20 million to build first phase projectsThis is Lafayette Avenue, and that's redesigned by Matthews Nealston-Lanascade BarcatexAnd once this path is constructed, it'll connect the south Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park right now, where's separated by about 25 feet of water, but this and it's just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

highwayWe have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to reinvision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for park land, affordable housing, and local economic developmentWe also built the city's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our officesCool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat and pass it onto the building or atmosphereGreen roofs are soil and living plantsBoth can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban heat island effect, and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breatheGreen roofs also retain up to 75% of rainfall, so they reduce the city's needs to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions, which incidentally are often located in environmental justice communities like mineAnd they provide habitats for our little friendsSo, so coolAnyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own greener-fenstellation business, bringing jobs as sustainable economic activity to the South HouseAPPLAUSE I like that, tooOh, anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention, we need investors and of pitchIt's better to ask for forgiveness than permissionAnywayOkayKatrinaPride of Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans and Northward had a lot in commonBoth were largely populated by poor people of colorBoth hotbeds of cultural innovationThink hip hop and jazzBoth the waterfront communities that host both industries and residents and close proximity to one anotherIn the post Katrina era, we have still more in commonwe're at best ignored and maligned and abused at worseBy negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lacks governmental accountabilityNeither the destruction of the knife ward nor the South Bronx was inevitableBut we have emerged with valuable lessons and about how to dig ourselves outWe are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents coming goneNow, we'll be let the Gulf Coast language for a decade or two like the South Bronx did, or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation out in communities like mineNow listen, I do not expect individuals corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moralThis presentation today only represents some of what I've been throughLike a tiny little bit, you've no clueBut I'll tell you later if you want to knowBut I know it's the bottom line or one's perception of it that motivates people in the endI'm interested in what I like to call the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produceDevelopments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concernThe developers, government, and the community where these projects go upAt present, that's not happening in New York CityAnd we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficitA parade of government subsidies is going to propose big box and stadium developments in the South BronxBut there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with a cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste, and the impacts on open spaceAnd there approaches to local economic and job development are so lameIt's not even funnyBut because on top of that, the richest, the world's richest sports team is replacing the house that Ruth built by destroying two well-loved community parksNow we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlierAnd although less than 25% of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces yet zip in terms of public transitNow what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fixing a healthy environment-free challenge community versus incorporating structural sustainable changesMy agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issuesNow, let's get this straightI am not any developmentI was as a city, not a wilderness preserve, and having embraced my intercapitalistAnd but I don't have, probably all having to be, if you haven't, you need toSo I don't have a problem with developers making moneyThere's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable community friendly development can still make a fortuneFormer fellow tech service bill Madonna and Emily Loveins both heroes of mine, by the way, you know, have shown that you can actually do thatI do have a problem with developments that hyper exploit politically vulnerable communities for profitThat it continues is a shame upon us all because we're all responsible for the future that we createBut one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other citiesThis is my version of globalizationLet's take BogotaPoor Latino surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug traffickingA reputation not unlike that of the South BronxHowever, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique BenjanozaHe looked at the demographicsFew Bogotanias own cars yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving If you're a mayor, you can do something about thatHis administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three outlawed parking on those streetsExpanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanesCreated public lossesCreated one of the most efficient bus mass transit systems in the entire worldFor his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeachedBut as people began to see that they were being put first on issues, reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happenedPeople stopped a literary crime rates dropped because the streets were alive with peopleHis administration detects several typical urban problems at one time and on a third world budget at thatWe have no excuse in this countryI'm sorry, but the bottom line is, there are people for a agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather to provide opportunities for all Bogotanios to participate in the city's that development should not come at the expense of the majority of the populationIt's still considered a radical idea here in the USBut Bogotog's example has the power to change thatYou, however, are blessed with the gift of influenceThat's why you're here and why you value the information we exchangeUse your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhereDon't just talk about it, it's headThis is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to buildthat I'm trying to build and as you all know, politics are personalHelp me make green the new blackHelp me make sustainability sexyMake it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversationsHelp me fight for environmental and economic justiceSupport investments with a triple bottom line returnHelp me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and assisting the comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhereOh, good, glad I have a little more timeListen, when I spoke to MrGore, the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategyHis response was a grant programI don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for fundingI was making him an offerWhich probably was that this top down approach is still aroundI don't get me wrong, we need moneyBut grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making processOf the 90% of the energy that MrGore reminded us that we waste every dayDon't add wasting our energy intelligence and hard earned experience to that countI have come from so farTo meet you like this, please don't waste meBy working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the worldWe might have come to this conference from very, very different stages in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thingWe have nothing to lose and everything to gainAbelosThank youThank you so much, Chris, and it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twiceI'm extremely gratefulI have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other nightAnd I say that sincerely, partly because I need thatPut yourselves in my positionI flew on Air Force 2 for eight yearsNow I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplaneI'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for meIt's a true storyEvery bit of this is trueSoon after, Tip and I left the White House, we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville, driving ourselvesI know it sounds like a little thing to you, but I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit meThere was no motorcade back thereYou've heard of Phantom Lim painThis was a rented Ford TouristIt was dinner timeAnd we started looking for a place to eatWe were on I-40, we got to exit 238, 11 in Tennessee, And we got off the X to start looking with our own to show these restaurantLocals, family, restaurant, chain for those of you don't know itWe went in and sat down at the booth and theWriters came over, made a big emotion over, TipperShe took our order and then went to the couple and then moved next to us and she lowered her voice so much I'd really strained to hear what she was sayingAnd she said, yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore his wife, TipperAnd the man said, he's come down a long wayThere's been kind of a series of epiphanysThe very next day, continuing a totally true story, I got on a G5 to fly to Africa, to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Legos, on the topic of energyAnd I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in NashvilleAnd I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you, Tip and I were driving ourselves, Shoney, his low-cost family restaurant, and Shane with the man said, they laughedI gave my speech and went back out to the airport to fly back homeI fell asleep on the plane until during the middle of the night we landed on the Azoor for his islands for refillingI woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runwayAnd he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, call Washington, call WashingtonAnd I thought to myself, the middle of the night, middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? I remember it could be a bunch of thingsBut what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech and it had already been printed in all across the United States of America's printed and Monterey at checkedAnd the story began, former Vice President Algor announced in Nigeria yesterday, quote, My wife, Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant named Shonies, and we are running it ourselvesBefore I could get back to US soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started inAnd one of them had me in a big white chef's hatChipper was saying, one more burger with friesThree days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton saying, congratulations on the new restaurant outWe like to celebrate each other's successes in lifeSo you're going to talk about information ecologyBut I was thinking that since I planned to make a lifelong habit of coming back to Ted, maybe I could talk about that another timeIt's a dealI want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of, I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or fiveNow, oh, the slideshowI update the slideshow every time I give it, I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give itIt's like beach combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shellsJust in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in JanuaryThis is just for the United States of AmericaStarcoil average for January is the 31 degreesLast month was 395 degreesNow, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environmentI'm kiddingBut these are the recapitulation slides and then I'm going to go into a new material about what you can doBut I wanted to elaborate on a couple of theseFirst of all, this is where we're projected to go with the US contribution to global warming under business as usualEfficiency in induced electricity and in use of all energy is the low hanging fruit, efficiency and conservationIt's not a cost, it's a profitThe sign is wrongIt's not negative, it's positiveThese are investments that pay for themselves, but they are also very effective in deflecting our pathCars and trucksI talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspectiveIt's an easy visible target of concern and it should be, but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucksCars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the worldAnd so we should address that, but it's part of the puzzleOther transportation is efficiency is as important as cars and trucksThe pupils at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference and with what, uh, the vote and some, uh, and, uh, John DoranOthers, many of you here, a lot of people directly involved in this, this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows itCarbon capture and sequestrationThat's what CCS stands foris likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safeNot quite there yetOK, now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your homeMost of these expenditures are also profitableinsulation, better design, by green electricity, where you canI mentioned automobiles by a hybrid, use light railFigure out some of the other options that are much betterIt's importantBe a green consumerYou have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisisConsider this, make a decision to live a carbon neutral lifeThose of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most peopleIt is easier than you thinkIt really isA lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easyIt means it means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reducedAnd what it means is elaborated at climatecrisisnetHere is a carbon calculatorParticipant productions convened with my active involvement, the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculatorYou can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, And then you will be given options to reduceAnd by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 20, and we will have click through purchases of offsetsNext, consider making your business carbon neutralAgain, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you thinkIntegrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology or entertainment design and architecture communityInvest sustainablyMajora mentioned thisListen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO managementOver time people do what you pay them to dopay them to doAnd if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisionsA lot more to be said about thatBecome a catalyst of change, teach others, learn about it, talk about itThe movie comes outThe movie is a movie version of the slideshow that they gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertainingAnd it comes out in MayMany of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see itConsider sending somebody to Nashville, pick well, and I am personally going to train people to give this slide show, repurposed with some of the personal storiesobviously replaced with a generic approachAnd it's not just the slides, it's what they mean, and it's how they link togetherAnd so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it in mass and communities all across the countryAnd we're going to update the slideshow for all of themEvery single week to keep it right on the cutting edgeworking with Larry Lessig, it will be somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited use copyrights so that young people can remix it and do it in their own wayWe're to get the idea that you ought to stay arms links from politicsIt doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a DemocratWe need Republicans as wellThis ought to be, it used to be a bipartisan issueAnd I know that in this group, it really isBecome politically activeMake our democracy work the way it's supposed to workSupport the idea of capping carbon to oxide emissions, global warming pollution, and trading itHere's whyAs long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed systemOnce it becomes a closed system with US participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors, how many people here serve on the board directors of a corporationOnce it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoidedThe market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish thisHelp with a mass persuasion campaign that will start the springto change the minds of the American people, because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be doneAnd in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once didIt's now repetition of short, hot-button 30-second 28-second television adsWe have to buy a lot those adsLet's re-brand global warming as many of you have suggestedI like climate crisis instead of climate collapse, but again those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on thisSomebody said that test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combinationThat's really trueI said the other night and I'll repeat now, this is not a political issueAgain, the Republicans here, this shouldn't be partisanYou have more influence than some of us who are Democrats doThis is an opportunity, not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to themWe are oneThank you very much, I appreciate it
