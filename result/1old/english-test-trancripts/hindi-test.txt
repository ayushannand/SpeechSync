So why grow homes? Because we can
Right now America is in a unremitting state of trauma, and there's a cause for that
Right? We've got Mick Peeple, Mick Cars, Mick Houses, right? As an architect, I have to confront something like this
So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses? Well, it's been around for 2,500 years
It's called Pleaching, or grafting trees together, together, or grafting an osculate matter into one contiguous fascular system
And we do something different than what we did in the past
We add a kind of a modicum of intelligence to that
We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi-apathetic matter plants into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a fab tree hat
It fits into the environment
It is the environment
It is the landscape, right? And you can have a hundred million of these homes
And it's great because they suck carbon, right? They're perfect
You can have 100 million families or take things out of the suburbs because these are homes that are a part of the environment
Imagine pre-growing a village, right, takes about seven to ten years and everything is green
So not only do we do the veggie house, we also do the Invitro Meat Habitat or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn, where as an architecture office where the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative of medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one
So we've been doing this for a couple of years and that's our lab
And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs
We use a modifying jet printer and we print geometry
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects, like shoes, other belts, handbags, etc
Where no sentient creature is harmed
It's victimless
It's meat from a test tube
Our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes
So here is a typical stud wall in architectural construction
And this is a section of our proposal for a meat house where you can see we use fatty cells, his insulation, silica for dealing with wind loads, and spinked her muscles for the doors and windows
And we know it's incredibly ugly, but it could have been an English tutor or Spanish colonial, but we kind of chose this shape
There it is, kind of a grown, at least one particular section of it
We had a big show in Prague, and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral, so religion can confront the house of me
That's why we grow homes
Thanks very much
When I was 10 years old, a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school
As a special treat, he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands
And there it was the seat of human consciousness, the powerhouse of the human body sitting in my hands
And that day I knew that when I grew up, I was going to become a brain doctor scientist something or the other
Years later, when I finally grew up, my dream came true
And it was while I was doing my PhD on the neurological causes of dyslexia and children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today
It is estimated that one in six children that's one in six children suffer from some developmental disorder
This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments, which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder
But here's what really perplexed me
Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain, most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without even doing any CG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart
It seemed so intuitive to me to diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately
It would be necessary to look at the brain directly, looking at behavioral loan can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete or even a misleading picture of the child's problems
Yet despite all the advances in medical technology, The diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited
And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it instead of in-brained research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children
The groundbreaking technology records the EEG or the electrical activity of the brain in real time, allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions, vision, attention, language, or addition
A program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain
And another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant, allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child symptoms
And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team and was finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders
And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in India
I like to tell you about one such child, whose story was also covered by ABC News
Seven-year-old Justin Senegar came to our clinic with his diagnosis of very severe autism
Like many autistic children, his mind was locked inside his body
There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time
And the doctor told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially and he would probably never have too much language
When we use this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain, the results were startling
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic
He was suffering from a brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye, but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism
After Justin was given anti-seagium education, the change in him was amazing
Within a period of 60 days, his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words
And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school, and even became a karate superchamp
Research shows that 50% of children, almost 50% of children diagnosed with autism, are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures
These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin
All these children came to our clinic with the diagnosis of autism, attention, deficit disorder, mental retardation, language problems
Instead, our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments
So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment
For too long now, children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen
And for too long, these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience, one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively and find the true source of so many disabilities in children
So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder, then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved
One more mind will be unlocked and one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover
And all this by simply watching the child's brain race

Laser sharp focus to such an extent that I dance to few weeks after surgery
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles much to the dismay of my oncologist
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule

I would be willing to bet that I'm the dumbest guy in the room
Because I couldn't get through school, I struggled with school
But what I knew at a very early age was that I loved money and I loved business and I loved this entrepreneurial thing
And I was raised to be an entrepreneur
And what I've been really passionate about ever since, and I've never spoken about this ever until now
So this is the first time I knew it was overherited except my wife three days ago because she said, what are you talking about? And I told her, is that I think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing
It's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified, which is what happens in a lot of society
Kids, when we grow up, have dreams and we have passions and we have visions and somehow we get those things crushed and we get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor
And my parents got me a tutor in French, and I still suck in French
Two years ago, I was the highest rated lecturer at MIT's entrepreneurial masters program, and it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world
When I was in grade two, I want a citywide speaking competition
But nobody had ever said, hey, this kid's a good speaker, he can't focus, but he loves walking around and getting people energized
No one has said, get him a coach in speaking
They say, get me a tutor in what I suck out
So as kids show these traits and we need to start looking for them, I think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers
And unfortunately, the school system is grooming this world to say, hey, let's be a lawyer, let's be a doctor
And we're missing that opportunity because no one ever says, hey, being entrepreneur
Entrepreneurs are people because we have a lot of them in this room who have these ideas and these passions or cities needs them in the world and we decide to stand up and do it
And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen
And we have the ability to get those groups of people around us and want to kind of build that dream with us
And I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea to young age of being entrepreneurial, we could change everything in the world that's a problem today
Every problem that's out there, somebody has the idea for
And as a young kid, nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out
I think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish
So, parable if you give a manifest, you feed them for a day, if you teach a manifest, you feed them for lifetime
If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial, the ones that show those traits to be, like we teach the ones who have science, gifts to go on in science
What about if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs, we could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts
What we do is we sit and we teach our kids all the things they shouldn't do
Don't hit, don't bite, don't swear
Right now, we teach our kids to go after really good jobs
the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot
And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like Luongo, Crosby
Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs
The reason that I avoided an MBA program other than the fact that I couldn't get into any, because I had a 61 percent average out of high school and then 61 percent average at the only school in Canada that except to make Carlton
But our MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs
They teach them to go work in corporations
So who's starting these companies? It's these random few people
Even in popular literature, the only book I've ever found, and this should be on all of your reading lists, the only book I've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is Atlas shrugged
Everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we're bad people
I look at even my family
My both my grandfather's ranch partners, my dad was an entrepreneur, and both my brother and sister, and I all three of us own companies as well
And we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we've shit
We didn't fit in the normal work
We couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits
But kids could be entrepreneurs as well
I'm a big part of a couple organizations, globally called the Entrepreneurs Organization and the Young President's organization
I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO Global Conference and everyone that I met over there who was an entrepreneur, struggled with school
I have 18 of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder, diagnosed
So this thing right here is freaking me out
It's probably why I'm a little bit panicked right now, other than all the caffeine that I've had in the sugar, but like this is like really creepy for an entrepreneur
Attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder
Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease
Ted Turner's got it
Steve Jobs has it
All three of the founders of Netscape had it
Like it go on and on
Kids, you can and see these signs in kids
And what we're doing is we're giving them riddle in and saying, don't be an entrepreneurial type fit into this other system and try to become a student
Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students
We fast track, we figure out the game
I stole essays, I cheated on exams, I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for 13 consecutive assignments, but like as an entrepreneur, you don't do accounting, you hire a accountant
So I just figured that out earlier
At least I can admit I cheated in the university most of you won't
I'm also quoted and I told the person who wrote the textbook
I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every Canadian university in college, studies in managerial accounting
I'm chapter eight
I opened up chapter eight talking about budgeting
And I told the author after they did my interview that I cheated in that same course and she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway
But kids, you can see these signs in them
The definition of an entrepreneur is a person who organizes the operates and assumes the risk of a business venture
That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program
It doesn't mean you have to get through school
It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut
And we've heard those things about, is it nurture or is it nature? Is it thing one or thing two? What is it? Well, I don't think it's either
I think it can be both
I was groomed as an entrepreneur
When I was growing up as a young kid, I had no choice because I was taught at a very early young age
On my dad realized I wasn't going to fit into everything else
It was being taught to me in school that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age
He groomed us the three of us to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we can employ other people
My first little business venture I was seven years old, I was in Winnipeg and I was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords
And I was calling all of the dry cleaners and Winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers
My mom came into the room and she said, where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners? And I said, let's go and look in the basement
And we went down to the basement, and I opened up this cupboard and there was about 1,000 code hangers that I'd collected, because when I told her I was going out to play with the kids, I was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect code hangers to put in the basement to sell
Because I saw her a few weeks before that, taking, you could get paid
They used to pay you two cents per code hanger
So I was just like, well, there's all kinds of code hangers
And so I'll just go get them
And I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them
So I just did it anyway
But, and I learned that you could actually negotiate with people
This one person offered me three cents and I got them up to three and a half
I even knew at a seven year old age that I could actually get a fractional percent of a cent and people would pay that because it multiplied up
At seven years old, I figured out I got three and a half cents for a thousand code hangers
I sold license plate protectors door to door
My dad actually made me go find someone who had saw me these things at wholesale and at nine years old, I walked around in the city of Sudbury selling license plate protectors door to door to houses
And I remember this one customer who was so vividly
I could never, I also did some other stuff with these clients
they sold newspapers and he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me ever
But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license plate protector
And he's like, well, we don't need one
I said, but you've got two cars
Remember, I'm nine years old
I'm like, but you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors
And I said, I know
And I said, and this car here's got one license plate that's all crumpled up
And he said, yes, that's my wife's car
And I said, why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer
So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each
If I couldn't sell all four, I could at least get one
I learned that at a young age
I did comic book arbitrage when I was about 10 years old
I sold comic books, or I recorded John George and Bay
And I would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids
And then I would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids
But it was obvious to me, right? Buy low sell high
You've got this demand over here that has money
Don't try to sell to the poor kids
They don't have cash
The rich people do go get some
So that's obvious, right? It's like a recession
So there's a recession
There's still $13 trillion circulating in the US economy
Go get some of that
And I learned that at a young age
I also learned, don't reveal your source, because I got beat up after about four weeks at doing this, because one of the rich kids found it where I was buying my comics from, and he didn't like your five years paying a lot more
I was forced to get a paper root at 10 years old
I didn't really want a paper root, but at 10 my dad said that's gonna be your next business
So not only would he get me one, but I had to get two, and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers, which I did, and then I realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money, so I would collect the tips and get payment
So I would go and collect for all the papers
He could just deliver them, because then I realized I could make the money
By this point, I was definitely not going to be an employee
My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop, and he had all these old automotive parts lying around, and they had this old brass and copper
And so I asked him what he did with it, and he said he just throws it out
And I said, but wouldn't somebody pay you for that? And he goes maybe
Remember, at 10 years old, it's a 34 years ago
I saw opportunity in this stuff
I saw there was money in garbage, and I was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle
And then my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler where I got paid
And I thought that was kind of cool
Strangely enough, like 30 years later, we're building 1-800-GOT junk and making money off that, too
I built these little pin cushions
I was 11 years old and Cubs, and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother's Day
And you made these pin cushions out of wooden closeness, who used to hang clothes on clothes lines outside
And you'd make these chairs
And I had these little pillows that I would sew up
And you could stuff pins in them
And because people used to sew when they needed a pin cushion
So, but what I realized was that you had to have options
So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown
And then when I went to the door, it wasn't do you want to buy one? It was like, which color would you like? Like I'm 10 years old
You're not going to say no to me
And especially if you have two options, you have the brown one or the clear one
So I learned that lesson of the young age
I learned that manual labor really sucks
Right, like cutting lawns is brutal
But because I had to cut lawns all summer for our all over neighbors and get paid to do that, I realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing
But if I'm cutting, if I land this client once and every week I get paid by that person, that's way better than trying to sell one close, pin thing to one person, because you can't sell them more
So I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn to the young age
Remember, I was being groomed to do this
I was not allowed to have jobs
I would cadi, I'd go to the golf course and cadi for people, but I realized there was this one hill on our golf course, the 13th hole that had this huge hill and people could never get their bags up it
So I would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies
I would carry their golf bags up to the top, and they'd pay me a dollar
Meanwhile, my friends were working for five hours to haul some guys bag around and get paid 10 bucks
I'm like, that's stupid, because you have to work for five hours
That doesn't make any sense
You just figure out a way to make more money faster
Every week, I would go to the corner store and buy all these pops, and I would go up and deliver them to these 70 year old women playing bridge
And they'd give me their orders to the following week, and then I would just deliver pop, and I'd just charge twice
And I had this captured market
You didn't need contracts
you just needed to have a supply and demand and this audience who bought into you, these women weren't going to go to anybody else because they liked me and I kind of figured it out
I went and got golf balls from golf courses, but everybody else was like, walking and looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls, I'm like, screw that
They're all in the pond
And nobody's going into the pond
So I would go into the pond and crawl around and pick them up with my toes
You just pick them up both feet and you can't do it on stage
And you get the golf balls and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunk, So when you're done, you got a couple hundred of them
But the problem is that people didn't all want all the golf balls
So I just packaged them
I'm like 12, right? I packaged them up three ways
I had the pinnacles and DDHs and the really cool ones back then
Those sold for $2 each and then I had all the good ones
It didn't look crappy
They were 50 cents each and then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones and they could use those for practice balls
And I sold sunglasses when I was in school to all the kids in high school
This is what really kind of gets everybody hating you because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time
But it paid the bills
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses
And then when the school shut me down, the school actually called me into the office and told me I couldn't do it
So I went to the gas stations and I sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers
That was cool, because then I had to retail at Lutz
And I was, I think I was 14
And then I paid my entire way through first year university at Carlton by selling wine skins, Dor de Dor
You know that you can hold a 40 ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke and a wine skin
So what, right? Yeah, but you know what? You stuff that down your shorts
When you go into a football game, you can get booze in for free
Everybody bought them
Supply demand, big opportunity
I also branded it
So I sold them for five times in normal cost
I had our university logo on it
You know, we teach our kids and we buy them games, but why don't we get them games if they're entrepreneurial kids that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs? Why don't you teach them not to waste money? I remember being told the walk at the middle of the street in Bamfell, Bertha, because I had thrown a penny out in the street
My dad said, go pick it up
He said, I work two damn hard for my money
I'm not going to see you ever waste a penny
And I remember that lesson to this day
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits
Allowances by nature are teaching kids to think about a job
An entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck
Allowances breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck
That's wrong for me if you want to raise entrepreneurs
What I do with my kids now, I've got two nine and seven, as I teach them to walk around the house and the yard looking for stuff that needs to get done, come to me and tell me what it is or I'll come to them and say, here's what I need done
And then you know what we do, we negotiate
They go around looking for what it is, but then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid
And then they don't have a regular check, but they have more opportunities to find more stuff and they learn the skill of negotiating and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well
You breed that kind of stuff
Each of my kids is two piggy banks
50% of all the money that they earn or get gifted
50% goes in their house account, 50% goes in their toy account
Anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want, the 50% goes in their house that kind of every six months goes to the bank
They walk up with me every year, all the money in the bank goes to their broker, both by nine and seven year olds have a stock broker already
But I'm teaching them to force that savings habit
It drives me crazy that 30 year olds are saying, maybe I'll start contributing to my RRSP now
Shit, you've missed 25 years
Like you can teach those habits to young kids when they don't even feel the pain yet
Don't read them bedtime stories every night
Maybe four nights out of the week, read them bedtime stories and three nights so that we have them tell stories
Why don't you sit down with kids and give them four items, a red shirt, a blue tie, a kangaroo, and a laptop, and have them tell a story about those four things
My kids do that all the time
It teaches them to sell, it teaches them creativity, it teaches them to think on their feet
Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it
Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk
Even if it's just stand up in front of the friends and do plays and have speeches, those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing
Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like, show them the grumpy employees
When you see grumpy customer service point that out them say, by the way, that guy's a crappy employee and say these ones are good ones
If you go into a restaurant, you have bad customer service, show them what bad customer service looks like
Right? We have all of these lessons in front of us that we don't take those opportunities, we teach kids to go get a tutor
Imagine if you actually took all the kids junk that's in the house right now, all the toys that they're outgrown two years ago and said, why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji? and they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in
They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever, but teach them how to fix the price, guess the price, pull up the logos, like the photos, teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money
Then the money they get, 50% goes in their house account, 50% goes in their toy account
My kids love this stuff
Some of the entrepreneurial traits that you got in nurturing kids, attainment, tenacity, leadership, introspection, interdependence, values, all these traits you can find in young kids and and you can help nurture them
Look for that kind of stuff
There's two traits that I want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system
Don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder, unless it is really, really freaking bad
The same with the whole thing's on Mayan, stress and depression, like unless it is so clinically brutal, man, bipolar disorder is nickname the CEO disease
When Steve Jervitz and Jim Clark and Jim Barclay have all got it, and they built an escape
Imagine if they were given riddle and we wouldn't have that stuff
Al Gore would have really had to have been into the internet
These skills are the skills that we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else
I'm not saying don't get kids to want to be lawyers, but how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well? Because there's huge opportunities in that
I wanna close with a quick little video
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor
These guys, Grasshopper
It's about kids
It's about entrepreneurship
Hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with it to change the world
Thank you
Thank you
music Thank you very much for having me
I was here four years ago and I remember at the time that the talks weren't put online
I think they were given to teardisters in a box, a box set of DVDs, which they put on their shells, where they are now
And actually Chris called me a week after I'd give my talk and said, said, we're going to start putting them online, could we put yours online?" I said, sure
And four years later, as I said, it's been seen by four, well, it's been downloaded four million times
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people have seen it
And as Chris says, there is a hunger for videos of me
Don't you feel? So this whole event has been an elaborate build-up to me doing another one for you
So here's his
I'll go spoke at the Ted Conference I spoke at four years ago and talk about the climate crisis and I referenced that at the end of my last talk
So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes, frankly
And so as I was saying
He's right
I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously
And I think if people don't believe it, they should get ammo
But I believe there's a second climate crisis, which is as severe, which has the same origins, and that we have to deal with with the same urgency
And I mean by this, and you may say, by the way, look, I'm good
I have one climate crisis
I don't read either second one
But this is a crisis of not natural resources that I believe that's true, but a crisis of human resources
I believe fundamentally, as many speakers have said in the past few days that we make very poor use of our talents
Very many people go through their whole lives, having no real sense of what their talents may be, or if they have any, to speak of
I lead all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything
Actually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now
Jeremy Benthum, the great utilitarian philosopher, once spiked this argument, you know, he said there are two types of people in this world
Those who divide the world into two types, and those who do not
Well, I do
And I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do
They simply go through their lives, getting on with it
They get no great pleasure from what they do, they endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend
But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else
If you said them don't do this anymore, they'd wonder what you're talking about
Because it isn't what they do, it's who they are
They say, but this is me
It would be foolish for me to abandon this because it speaks to my most authentic self
And it's not true of enough people
If I don't the country, I think it's a story of a minority of people
And I think there are many possible explanations for it
And high among them is education
Because education in a way dislocates very many people from their natural talents
And human resources are like natural resources
They're often very deep
You have to go looking for them
They're not just lying around on the surface
You have to create the circumstance is where they show themselves
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens, but too often it's not
Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment
And it's not enough
Reform is no use anymore
Because that's simply improving a broken model
What we need in the words we use many times to end the course the past few days is not evolution, but a revolution in education
This has to be transformed into something else
APPLAUSE One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education
Innovation is hard because it means doing something that people don't find very easy for the most part
It means challenging what we take for granted
Things that we think are obvious
The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense
Things that people think, well, they can't be done anyway, because that's the way it's done
I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln, who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point
He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress
I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time
We don't teach American history in Britain
We suppress it
You know, this is our policy
So, so no doubt something fascinating is happening in December 1862, which the Americans among us will be aware of
But he said this, the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present
The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion
I love that, not rise to it, rise with it
As our case is new, so we must think a new and act a new
We must disenthroil ourselves, and then we shall save our country
I love that word, disenthroil
You know what he means, there are ideas that all of us are in Thrall II, which we simply take for granted as the natural order things, the way things are
And many of our ideas have been formed not to meet the circumstances of this century, but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries, but our minds are still hypnotized by them
And we have to descend Thrall ourselves of some of them
Now, doing this is easy to said than done
It's very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted
And the reason is that you take it for granted
So let me ask you something you may take for granted
How many of you here are over the age of 25? That's not what I think you take for granted
I'm sure you're familiar with that already
Are there any people here under the age of 25? Great
Now, there was over 25
Could you put your hands up if you're wearing a wristwatch? Now, that's a great deal of, isn't it? Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches
I don't mean they can't, or they're not allowed to, they just often choose not to
And the reason, as you see, that we were brought up in a pre-digital culture, those who was over 25, and so for us, if you want to know the time, you have to wear something to tell it
Kids now live in a world which is digitized, and the time for them is everywhere
They see no reason to do this
And by the way, you don't need to do it either
It's just that you've always done it
And you carry on doing it
My daughter never wears a watch
My daughter Kate, who's 20, she doesn't see the point
And as she says, it's a single function device
How lame is that? And I say, no, no, it tells the date as well
It has multiple functions
BC, there are things we're in throught to in education
Let me give you a couple of examples
One of them is the idea of linearity
that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right, you will end up set for the rest of your life
Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly or sometimes explicitly a different story that life is not linear, it's organic
We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us
But you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college
Certain sorts of college, I don't know when you shouldn't go to college, but not everybody needs to go
And not everybody needs to go now
Maybe they go later, not right away
I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing
There was a Skype buying a book
It is in his 30s and I said, what do you do? And he said, I'm a fireman
And I said, how long have you been a fireman? He said, always
I've always been a fireman
And I said, well, when did you decide? He said, there's a kid
He said, actually, it was a problem for me at school because at school, everybody wants to be a Simon
He said that I wanted to be a Simon
And he said, when I got to the senior school, my teachers didn't take it seriously
This one teacher didn't take it seriously
He said, I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it
That I should go to college
I should become a professional person
I had great potential
And I was wasting my talent to do that
And he said it was humiliating because he said in front of the whole class, and I really felt dreadful
But it's what I wanted
And as soon as I left school, I applied to the fire service and I was accepted
And he said, and I was thinking about that guy recently, just a few minutes ago, when you were speaking, about this teacher
He said, because six months ago, I saved his life
He said, he was in a car wreck
And I pulled him out, gave him CPR, and I saved his wife's life as well
He said, I think he thinks better off me now
No
No
Thank you
You know what I mean? Human communities depend upon a diversity of talent, not a singular conception of ability
And at the heart of our challenges, and at the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence
This linearity thing is a problem
When I arrived in LA a few years, about nine years ago, I came across a policy statement, very well-intentioned, which said college begins in kindergarten
No, it doesn't
It doesn't
If we had time, I could go into this, but we don't
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten
A friend of mine, one said, you know, a three-year-old, is not half a six-year-old
They're three, but as we just heard in this last session, there's such competition now to get into kindergarten to get to the right kindergarten that people are being interviewed for it
A three
Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels, you know, with their resumes
Flipping through, say, what, this is it
You've been around for 36 months, and this is it
You live
You've achieved nothing, can it? Spet the first six months breastfeeding, what I can say is
It's outrageous, as in conception, but it tracks the other big issue as conformity
We have built our education systems on the model of fast food
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day
There are two models of quality assurance in catering
fast food where everything is standardized
The other things like zag and Michigan restaurants where everything is not standardized, they're customized to local circumstances and we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education and it's impoverishing our spirits and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies
I think we have to recognize a couple of things here
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse
People have very different attitudes
I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar
You know, it worked out for Eric
That's all I'm saying
You know, in the way it did not for me
I could not get this thing to work
No matter how often the hard I blew into it, you know, it just wouldn't work
But it's not only about that, it's about passion
Often people are good at things that don't really care for
It's about passion and what excites our spirit and our energy
And if you're doing the thing that you love to do that, you're good at, time takes a different course entirely
My wife's just finished writing a novel
And I think it's a great book, but she disappears for hours on end
You know this if you're doing something you love, an hour feels like five minutes
If you're doing something it doesn't resonate with your spirit, five minutes feels like an hour
And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit, it doesn't feed their energy or their passion
So I think we have to change metaphors
We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model education, a manufacturing model, which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people, we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture
We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process, it's an organic process
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development
All you can do is, like a farmer, is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish
So when we look at reforming education and transform it, it isn't like cloning a system
There are great ones like KIPPS, it's a great system
There are many great models
It's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to people you're actually teaching
And doing that I think is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution
It's about creating at movement in education in which people develop their own solutions but with external support based on a personalized curriculum
Now in this room there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business, in multimedia, in the internet
These technologies combine with extraordinary talents of teachers, provide an opportunity to revolutionize education and I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital not just to ourselves but to the future of our children, but we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model where each school can be flourishing tomorrow
That's where children experience life or at home if that's where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends
There's been a lot of talk about greens over the course of this few days and I wanted just to very quickly
I was very struck by Natalie Merch and songs last night recovering old poems
I wanted to read your quick very short phone from WBA, so some of you may know
He wrote this to his love, Mord Garn, and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give a what he thought she wanted from him
And he says, I've got something else, but it may not be for you
He says this, had either heavens embroidered class in rot with gold and silver light, of blue and the dim and the dark clouds of night and light and the half light
I would spread the clouds under your feet, but I, being poor, have only my dreams
I have spread my dreams under your feet
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams
And every day, everywhere our children spread their dreams beneath our feet
And we should tread softly
Thank you
APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Thank you, Hector
APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Thank you very much
I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people in the villages, in the slums, in the hinterland of the country who have solved problems through their own genius without any outside help
And our home minister announces a few weeks ago, a war on one third of India about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable, he missed a point
A point that we have been stressing for last until one years
The point that people may be economically poor, but they are not poor in the mind
In other words, the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds
That is the message which we started the one years ago
And what did it start? Let me just tell you briefly, my personal journey which led me to come to this point
85, 56, I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there, how to work, how to help scientists work on the lands on the fields of the poor people
how to develop research technologies, which are based on the knowledge of the people
I came back in 86
I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country, which had 60% landlessness, but amazing creativity
I started looking at my own work
They work that I had done for the previous 10 years, almost every time had instances of knowledge that people had shared
Now I was paid in dollars as a consultant and I looked at my income trace return and tried to ask myself, is there a line in my return which shows how much of this income gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible? Was it because I am brilliant that I am getting this reward or fixed recognition? Is it that I write very well, is it that I articulate is it that I analyze the data very well? Is it because I'm a professor and therefore I must be entitled to this reward for the society? I try to convince myself that no, no, no, I are good for the policy changes
You know, the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor
And therefore, I think it's okay, but it appeared to me that all these years that I've been working on exploitation, exploitation by landlords, Marmalin and his butt traders gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter because there was no line in my come test return was short this income occlude because of the brilliance of the people those people who have shared their knowledge in good faith and trust with me and nothing ever went back to them so much so that much of my work till that time wasn't English language
Majauri the people from whom I learned didn't know English
So what kind of accountability it was we are talking about social justice and here I was as a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous, getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy writing papers and publishing them in the papers, getting invited to the conferences, getting consultancies and whatever have you
So then if Dilma arose in the mind that if I am also an exploiter then this is not right, life cannot go on like that
This was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer
So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value-confixing management research, wrote, write about 100 papers
And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique, dilemma is not unique, the solution had to be unique
And one day I don't know what happened while coming back from the office towards home
I may be I saw I honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like honey bee, the life would be wonderful
What honey bee does? It pollinates, takes nectar from the flower, pollinate and the flower, cross pollinates
And when it takes the nectar, the flowers don't feel short-change
In fact they invite the honey bees so they call us
And they don't keep the bees, don't keep all the honey fatensates
these are three guiding principles of Honeybeen at work
That whenever we learn something from people, it must be shared with them in the language
They must not remain anonymous
And I must tell you that after 20 years, I have not made one percent change in the professional practice of this art
That is a great tragedy, which I am carrying is still with me
And I hope that all of you will carry this with you
That the profession is still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without distributing them at making them anonymous
There is such guidelines of US National Academy of Sciences or such Council of UK or Indian Council of Science, to such do not require, do not require that whatever you learn from people you must share back with them
We are talking about an accountable society, a society which is fair and just and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market and India wants to be a knowledge society
How will it be a knowledge society? So obviously you cannot have two principles of justice, one for yourself and one for others
It must be same, you cannot apply, you cannot discriminate, you cannot be in favor of your own values which are at distance from the values that you espouse
So fairness to one and to the other is not divisible
Look at this picture
Can you tell me where is it been taken from and what is it meant for anybody? I am a professor, I must quiz you
Anybody, anybody any guess at all? Pardon? Pardon? But what has it been used for? What has been used for? That's a good one
Pardon? You know, you're so right
We must give him a hand
Because this man knows how insensitive of a government is
Look at this
This is the site of government of India
It invites tourists to see the shame of our country
I'm so sorry to say that
This is a beautiful picture or is a terrible picture
depends upon how you look at the life of the people
If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles, you cannot be celebrating that, isn't it? We should need to be doing something about it
And let me tell you with all the science and technology that are command, millions of women still carry water on their head
And we do not ask this question
You must have taken tea in the morning
Think for a minute, the leaves of the tea plugged from the bushes
So what the action is, the action is, the lady picks up the few leaves, put them in the basket on the backside
Just do it 10 times
You will realize the pain in this shoulder and she does it thousands, thousands times every day
The rise that you ate in the lunch and you will eat today is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture
Millions of them, every season in the paddy season, when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water
and featured in the Waterville Developer Fungus infections
And that infection pains because then other insects bite that point and every year, 99
9% of the paddy is transplanted manually
No machines have been developed
So the silence of scientists, of technologist, of public policy makers, of the change agent, do you have a attention that this is not on, this is not on, this is not the way society will work, this is not what our parliament would do
We have a program for employment, hundred, 250 million people have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country for doing what for breaking stones, digging earth
So we took a question to the parliament that do poor have heads, do poor have legs, mouth and hand, but no head
So honey bee network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich
And what does happen? Anonymous, faceless, nameless person gets in contact with a network
And then gets an identity
This is what Honeybee network is about
And this network grew voluntarily, continuous to be voluntary, and has tried to map the minds of millions of people
Of our country and other parts of the world, who are creating? They could be creative in terms of education
They may be creative in terms of culture
They can be creative in terms of institutions
But, out of our work is in the field of technological creativity
The innovations, either in terms of contemporary innovations, or in terms of traditional knowledge
And it all begins with curiosity
It all begins with curiosity
This person whom we met and you will see it on the website, Sushidatovarji, this tribal person, he had a wish
And he said, if my wish gets fulfilled, somebody was sick and he had a manata that look God, please cure him
And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted
And this is what he got painted
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian Haraki
There could be nothing more wrong than the Meslovian model of hierarchy of needs
Because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment, carvage, Rahim, all the great saints, Sufi saints, there were all poor people and they had a great vision
Please do not ever think that only after meeting a physiological lead and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment
Any person, anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment only by the result that they have in their mind that they must achieve something
Look at this, we saw it and now show the Atra, every six months we've walked in different parts of the country
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years
So on the way side, we found these dunk cakes, which are used as a full
Not this lady, on the wall of the dunk cake, heave has made a painting
That's the only space she could express her creativity and she's so marvelous
Look at this lady Ramhti Marid Devi, on a grain bin in Champaran, we had to show the Atra
We were walking in the land where Gandhi ji went to hear about the tragedy pain of the Indigo growers
Habim Hathou and Purulia and Bancura, look at what she has done
The whole wall is at canvas
She is sitting there with a broom
Is she not is an or an artist? Obviously she is an artist
She is creative person
If we can create markets for these artists, we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they are bad at
Look at what Rhoddin has done
In Bhothi Hari, in Champaran, there were a lot of people who sell tea on the shelf
And obviously there's a limited market to tea as a morning you had tea as well as coffee
So he thought why not convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine? So this is a coffee machine
Just takes a few hundred rupees
He converts people bring their own cooker
He attaches a wall when it's three in pipe
And now he gives you a espresso coffee
Now, this is as the real affordable coffee per collector, it works on the gas
Look at what Sheikh Jangeer has done
Not a poor people do not have enough grains to get ground
So this fellow is bringing a floor grinding machine on a tubular
If you have 500 grams, 1000 1 kilogram, he will grind it for you
The floor will not grind such a small quantity
Please understand the problem of poor people
they have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy in terms of cost, in terms of quality
They don't want second standard second quality outputs, but to be able to give them high quality output, you need to adapt technology to their needs, and that's what Sheikh Jange done
But that's not enough what he did
Look at what he did here
If you have clothes and you don't have enough time to wash them, you brought a washing machine to your doorstep mounted on a two wheeler
So he's a model where a two wheeler washing machine, he's washing the clothes and drying them at your doorstep
You bring your water, you bring your soap
I wash the clothes for you charge 50 pounds of one repeat for you per lot and a new business model can emerge
Now what we need is we need people who will be able to scale them up
Look at this
It looks like a beautiful photograph, But you know what it is, can anybody guess what it is? Somebody from India would know of course
It's a, it's a, it's a, Tava is a hot plate made of clay
Now, what is the beauty in it? When you have a non-stick pan, it costs about maybe $250, $5, $6
This is less than a dollar
And this is a non-stick, It's coated with one of these food-grade materials
And the best part is that while you use a costly non-stick pan, you eat the so-called taffle on a taffle on like material
Because after some time, the surface appears
Where has it gone? It has gone in your stomach
It was not meant for that
But here, in this clay plate, hot plate, it would never go into your stomach
So it is better
It is safer
It is affordable
It is energy efficient
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper, need not be so called jagged, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient, they have to be affordable
And that is what Manso Bhai Pajapati has done
He has designed this blade with a handle and now in one dollar, you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you
This lady, she developed a herbal pesticide formulation
got a V5 depotent for her, National Innovation Foundation, and who knows somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products and she would get revenue
Now, let me mention one thing, I think we need a polycentric model of development, where large number of initiatives in different parts of the country, in different parts of the world, wouldn't know, serve the needs of locality, in a very efficient and adapted manner, higher the local fit, greater is the chance of scaling up
In the scaling up there's an inherent in advocacy to match the needs of the local people point by point with the supply that you're making
So while people are willing to adjust with that mismatch, they can think and scale up and they have scaled up
For example, cell phones, we have 400 million cell phones in this country
Now it's possible that I would use only two buttons in the cell phone
Only three options in the cell phone
It has 300 options
I'm paying for 300, I'm using only three, but I'm willing to live with it, therefore, it is scaling up
But if I had to get a match to match, obviously, I would need a different design of a cell phone
So what we are saying is that scalability should not become enemy of sustainability
There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality and yet one can be able to find them, fund them
One of the greatest strategy that we have been finding is that many times investors would this question
What is the scalable model? As if need of a community which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places have no legitimate right to get them fulfilled because they are not part of a large scale
So either you survive to imagine your needs to a large scale or else you remain out
Now the Amazon model, the long-tail model tells you that small sales of large number of books for example, having only few copies of the soil can still be a viable model
And we must find a mechanism where people will pull in the portfolio, will you invest in the portfolio where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities and yet the overall plate from the model will become viable
Look at what he is doing
Sadhullah Sahib is an amazing man at the age of 70, he is linking up something very creative
I am not a good man
I am not a good man
I am not a good man
My daughter is a man of the same age
And she is a man of the same age
She is a man of the same age
She is a man of the same age
Am I technology? Siddhulasab is in Mothihari again in Champaran
Wonderful human being
But still sells at this age, honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood
We have not been able to convince the water park people
They have got lake people in various municipal corporations
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai where there was a flood few years ago and people have to walk 20 kilometers waiting in the water that look you should have the cycling in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go where your transport would not go
So we have not yet cracked that problem of making it available as a rescue device as a winding device during the floods in the eastern India when you have to deliver things to people in different island where they are marooned
But idea has a merit
idea has a merit
What has a Pachandan, a Pachandan, unfortunately is no more, but he has left behind a message, a very powerful message
We are going to take a walk

And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from large number of farms rather than only few because at least you have to make a bit plate form and then plant her peer district requirement that
So you know we are advancing the frontiers of science
Raymea Joss has developed, you can go to the YouTube and find India in over it and then you will find these videos
Innovation by her when she went class 10th, a washing machine, a exercising machine, Mr
Karay who is a physically challenged person, one and half foot height only, But he has modified the two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility
This innovation is from the slums of Rio
And this person Mr
Ubeda Jera, we were talking about by friends in Brazil as to how do we scale up this model in China and Brazil and we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly, but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world
This is stand on the front wheel, you will not find in any cycle
India and China have the largest number of cycle
But this innovation emerged in Brazil
The point is, none of us should be parochial, none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas come from, will come only from our country
No, we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge, which economically poor people, wherever they are
And look at this whole range of cycle based innovation, cycle of the sprayer, cycle which generates energy from the shocks on the road
I can't change the condition of the road
I can make cycle run faster
That is what Kanaq does has done
And in South Africa, we had taken our innovators
Many others had gone there to share with their colleagues in South Africa as to how can innovation become a means of liberation from the tragedy that people have
And this is a donkey car which they modify
There's an axle here of 30 40 kg was serving no purpose
Remove it
The car becomes needs one donkey less
This is in China
This girl needed a breathing apparatus
Three, three people in the village sat down and decided to sit
How do we elongate the life of this girl in a far village? They were not related to her
But they try to find out how can we use the use the pipe of the washing machine, the user cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus and this breathing apparatus now saved the life and she's being welcomed
There are a whole range of innovations that we have, a car which runs on the compressed air with six-passer per kilometer, Assam, Kanagogoi and you would not find this car in US or Europe, but this is available in India
Now this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pocampalisari in one day, Now, 18,000 times, she had to do this winding, it generated two sorrows
This is what his son has done after 70 years of struggle
He said, change your profession
He said, I can't
This is the only thing I know, but I will invent a machine, which will solve your problem
And this is what he did
Also, machine in andropper dish
So this is what Sashit is saying
Give me a place to stand and I will move the word
I would just tell you that we are also doing competition among children for creativity, a whole range of things
We have sold things all over the world
From Ethiopia to Turkey to US to wherever, products have gone to the market, a few, these are the people who have knowledge made this hubba-weight cream for Xima possible
And here, a company which licensed this hubba-pets aside, put the photograph of the innovator on the packing, so that every time a user uses it, it asks the user, you can also be an innovator if you have an idea, send it back to us
So, creativity counts, knowledge matters, innovation stands for, incentives inspire, and incentives not just material, but also non-bethylene incentives
Thank you
Thank you
So the first robot to talk about is called Strider
It stands for a self-excited tri-pital dynamic experiment or robot
It's a robot that has three legs, which is inspired by nature
But have you seen anything in nature and animal that has three legs? Probably not
Why do I call this a biologically inspired robot? How would it work? But before that, let's look at pop culture
So H
J
Wells' World of Worlds novel, a movie
And what you see over here is a very popular video game
And these fiction-day describes these alien creatures and robots that have three legs that terrorize Earth
But my robot strider does not move like this
So this is an actual dynamic simulation animation
I was going to show you how the robot works
It flips this body 180 degrees
It swings its legs between the two legs and cats in the fall
So that's how it walks
But when you look at us human being, bipedal walking, what you're doing is you're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and do like an walk like a robot, right? What you're doing is you really swing your leg and cast the ball, stand up against swing your leg and cast the ball
You're using your built-in dynamics, the physics of your body, just like a pendulum
We call that the concept of passive dynamic local motion
What you're doing is when you stand up potential energy to kinetic energy, potential energy to kinetic energy, It's a constantly falling process
So even though there's nothing in nature that looks like this, really we're inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot
Thus is a biologically inspired robot
What you see over here, this is what we want to do next
What a fold up the legs and shoot it up for a long range motion
And it deploys legs
It looks almost like Star Wars
And when it lands, it absorbs a shock and starts walking
What you see over here, this yellow thing, this is not a death ray
This is just to show you that if we have cameras at the different types of sensors because it is tall It's 1
8 meters tall you can see over obstacles and bushes and those kind of things So we have two Prototypes the first Version in the back that's strider one the one in the front of the small one strider two The problem that we had with strider one is was just to heavy in the body We had so many mortars, you know, aligning the joints and those kind of things So we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we can get rid of all the mortars and with a single motor order, we can coordinate all the motions
We can have a solution to a problem so I'm using Necatchronics
So with this now, the top body is light enough, so it's walk you know that
This is always a very first successful step
It's still not perfect, it's coffee falls down so we still have a lot of work to do
The second robot I wanna talk about is called Impass
It stands for Intelligent, Mobili Platform with Actrated Spokesystem
So it's a real leg hybrid robot
think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel, but the spokes individually move in that out of the hub
So it's a wheel leg hybrid
We're literally reinventing the wheel here
Let me show how it demonstrates how it works
So in this video we're using a approach called the reactive approach
Just simply using a tactile sensors on the feet
It's trying to walk over a changing train, a soft train where it pushes it down to changes
And just by the tactile information it It successfully crosses over these type of train
But when it encounters a very extreme train, in this case, this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot than as soon as to a deliberate mode, where it uses a laser range finder and camera systems to identify the obstacle on the size, and it plans carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very, very impressive mobility
You probably haven't seen anything like this out there
This is a very high-movey robot that we call, called, Kimpass
Ah, is that cool? When you drive your car, when you steer your car, you use a method called acc-men steering
You're the front wheels rotate like this
For most of the small wheeled robots, they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turned off the direction
For Kimpass, we can do many, many different types of emotions
For example, in this case, Maybe the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle, rotating the same angle of velocity
We just simply change the length of the scope, infected diameter, and then you get to our left
So these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with in-pass
This robot is called Climber
Cables are suspended, limped intelligent, matching behavior robot
So I've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists, a JPL their famous for the Mars rovers, and the scientists, jolly just always tells me that the real interesting science, science research sites are always at the cliffs
But the Rooker and Robers cannot get there
So inspired by that, we want to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment
So this is climber
So what it does, it has three legs
It probably can't at a difficult sea, but it has a wind down a cable on the top
It tries to figure out the best place to put its foot
And then once the figure is out out, in real time, it calculates the force distribution
How much force and needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip
was a stabilizer that lives the foot and then with the winch, we can climb up these kind of stuff
Also for search on rescue applications as well
Five years ago, I actually worked at NASA JAPL doing the summer as a faculty fellow and the day I already had a six-legged robot car a limer
So this is actually based on that
This robot is called Mars, multi-epidage robot system
So as a hex-up on robot, we developed our adaptive gate planner
We actually have a very interesting payload on there
The students like to have fun
And here you can see that it's walking over on structure train
It's trying to walk on the four-stop train, the sad area
But depending on the oyster content, for the size or the grain size of the sad, the foot soil sink is the model changes
So it tries to adapt and skate to successfully cross over these kind of things
It also does some fun stuff
As kind of imagine, we get so many visitors of visiting our lab
So when the visitors come, Mars walks up to the computer, starts typing, hello, my name is Mars
Welcome to Romela
The Royce on Beckel and his love story yet
Virginie attack
This robot is a Meeba robot
Now we don't have enough time to go into technical details
I'll just show you some of the experiments
So this is all of the early feasibility experiments
We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move or use active tension course to make it move forward and backward
It's called Kymera
We also have been working with some scientists and engineers from New Penn to come up with a chemically-actuated version of this Meeba robot
We do something to something and just like magic it moves the laws This robot is a very recent project called Rafael robotic air powered hand with elastic ligaments There are a lot of really neat very good robotic hands out there in the market the promise There are just too expensive tens of thousands of dollars so for processes applications probably not to practical because it's not affordable We want to tackle this problem in a very different direction instead of using electrical motors, electrical actuators, we're using compressed air
We develop these novel actuators for the joints, so it's compliant, you can actually change the force simply just changing the air pressure and you can actually crush an empty sort of can, you can pick a very delicate objects like a raw egg or in this case a light bulb
The best part, it took only $200 to make the first prototype
This robot is actually a family of snake robots that we call hydros
Hyperduiser feed on robotic articulated server time
This is a robot that can climb structures
This is a hydros arm
It's a total different of feed on robotic arm, but the cool part is the user interface
The cable over there, that's an optical fiber
This student probably the first time using it, but she can articulate in many different ways
For example, in the ERR, the war zone, there's a roadside bombs
We're going to use this automatically
It's remotely controlled vehicles with an arm
It takes really a lot of time and is expensive to train to operate this complex arm
In this case, it's very intuitive
This student probably first time using it
We're in very complex manipulation tests, picking up objects and doing manipulation, just like that
Very intuitive
Now, this robot is currently our star robot
We actually have a fan club for the robot Darwin
Dynamic anthropomorphic robot with intelligence
As you know, we are very interested in human walking
So we decided to build a small human robot
This is at 2004
At that time, this is something really, really revolutionary
This is more of a feasible study
What kind of motor is truly used? Is it even possible? What kind of control should he do? So this does not have any sensors
So it's an open loop control
And for those who probably know, if you don't have any sensors, and there's any disturbances, you know what happens
So based on that success, in the following year, we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics and thus Darwin 1 was born in 2005
It stands up and walks very impressive
However, still as you can see, it has a port and a belly before
So we are still using external power source and external computation
So in 2006, now it's really time to have fun
Let's give it intelligence
We give all the computing power needs
1
5 yards Pentium M chip, 2 fire arc cameras, the rate gyros, X-Larmers, 4th Torx sensor on the foot
Leave them ponger batteries
And now, darned two is completely autonomous
It is not remote controlled
There's no headers
It looks around, searches for the ball, looks around, search for the goal, and it tries to play a game of soccer autonomously
Our official intelligence
Let's see how it does
Those are very first trial
And
Go! Yeah! Oh! Nice
So, there's actually a competition called Robocop
I don't know how many of you heard about Robocop
It's an international autonomous Robocop competition
And the goal of Robocop, the offshore goal is by the year 2050
We want to have full size autonomous human robots place soccer against the human rule cup champions and win
It's a true obstacle
It's a very ambitious goal, but we truly believe that we can do it
So this is last year in China
We were the very first team in the United States that qualified in the human rule cup competition
This is this year, this is in Austria
You guys see the active three against three
Completely autonomous
There you go
Yes
That way
The robots track
and they play a team play amongst themselves
It's very impressive
It's really a research event packaged in a more exciting competition events
What you see over here, this is the beautiful, Louie-Fuyton Cup trophy
So this is for the best humanoid
And we would like to bring this for the very first time to the United States next year, so wish us luck
Thank you
Thank you
Darin also has a lot of other talents
Last year, it actually conducted the Rono Symphony Orchestra for the holiday concert
This is the next generation robot Darwin 4, much smarter, faster, stronger
And it's trying to show off its ability
My macho, I'm strong
I can also do some Jackie Chan motion, martial art movements
That walks away
So this is Darwin 4
You'll be able to see in the lobby
We truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanly robot in the United States
So it's a stay tuned
All right, so I showed you some of our exciting robots to work
So what's the secret of our success? Where do we come with these ideas? How do we develop these kind of ideas? We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive in the urban environment
We want half a million dollars in the DARPA urban challenge
We also have the rules very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind, called the blind driver challenge, very exciting
and many, many other robots project I want to talk about
These are just awards that we won in 2007 fall from robots competition as those kind of things
So we really have five secrets
First is where do we get inspiration? Where do we get this spark of imagination? This is true story, my personal story
When I go to bed three, four a
m
in the morning, I lie down close my eyes and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around and they assemble and deform different mechanisms
And they're like, oh, this is cool
So, right next to my bed, I keep a notebook, a journal, with a special pen that has a light on it, LED light, because I don't want to turn the light and wake up my wife
So why I see this? I scribble everything down, draw things, and I go to bed
Every day in the morning, the first thing I do before my first cup of coffee, before my brush my teeth, I open my notebook
Many times this empty, sometimes they have something there
If something there is sometimes junk, but most of the time, I cannot even read my handwriting
It's like, for you in the morning, what do you expect? So I need to decipher what I wrote
But sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there and I have this iraccompanement
I directly run to my home office and in my computer, I type into ideas and sketch things out and I keep a database of ideas
So when we have these call for proposals, I try to find a match between my potential ideas and the problem if doesn't match, we got a research proposal, get the research funding in, and that's how we start our research programs
But just as far as imagination is not good enough, how do we develop these kind of ideas? At our lab, Romela, the Robax and Mechanism Laboratory, we have this fantastic brainstorming session
So we gather around, we discuss about problems and solutions problems that I talk about it
But before we start, we set this golden rule
The rule is nobody criticizes anybody's ideas
Nobody criticizes any opinion
This is important because many times students they fear they feel uncomfortable how other might think about their opinions and thoughts
So once you do this, it is amazing how students open up, they have this wacky, cool, crazy brilliant ideas and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy and this is how we develop our ideas
Well, we're running out of time, one more thing I want to talk about is, you know, just a spark of idea and development is not good enough
There was a great TED moment
I think was Sir Ken Robinson was it
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity
Well actually there's two sides to this story
So there's only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition
If you want to go beyond the tinkering, if you want to go beyond the hobbyist robotics and really tackle the grand challenge of robotics through rigorous research, we need more than that
This is where school comes in
Batman
Fighting as the bad guys, he has this utility belt
He has this grappling hook
all different kinds of gadgets
For us, row artists, engineers, scientists, these tools, these are the courses and classes you're taking class
Math, differentiator equations, I have linear algebra, science, physics, even now these chemistry and biology as you've seen, these are all the tools that we need
So the more tools you have for Batman, more effective in fighting the bad guys, for us, more tools to attack these kind of big problems
So education, very important
Also, it's not about that only about that you also have to work really, really hard
So I always tell my students, work smart, then work hard
This picture at the back, this is a 3am in the morning
I guarantee if you come to our lab, 3-4am, we have students working there, not because I tell them to, because we are having too much fun, which leads to the last topic
Do not forget to have fun
That's really the secret of our success
We're having too much fun
I truly believe that highest priority comes in when you're having fun
And that's what we're doing
And there you go
Thank you so much
Thank you
Now, I wanted to start with the question
When was the last time you were called childish? For kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence
Every time we make irrational demands, exhibit your responsible behavior, or display any other signs of being normal American citizens, we are called childish
Which really bothers me
After all, take a look at these events
imperialism and colonization, world wars, George W
Bush asked yourself, who's responsible? Adults! Now, what if kids done? Bull and Frank touched millions with their powerful account of the Holocaust? Ruby Bridges helped to encegregation in the United States
And most recently, Charlie Simpson helped to raise 120,000 pounds for Haiti on his little bike
So as you can see, Evidence by such examples, age has absolutely nothing to do with it
The traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior, associated with irresponsible, the an irrational thinking
Thank you
Then again, who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs
Maybe you've had grand plans before, but stop yourself thinking, that's impossible or that costs you much
That won't benefit me
For better or worse, sweet kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to things about reasons why not to do things
Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking, like my wish that knowing when hungry or that everything or a free kind of utopia
How many of you still dream like that believe in the possibilities
Sometimes, a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden, because you know that if everything were free, then the food stocks had become depleted and scarce and leaked chaos
On the other hand, we kid still dream about perfection
That's a good thing, because in order to make anything a reality, you have to dream about it first
In many ways, RIDASCy to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility
For instance, the Museum of Glass and the Kamal Washington, my home state, you who Washington
Uh, has the program called Kids Design Glass and Kids Draw their own ideas for glass art
Now, the resident artist said that they got some of their best ideas from the program because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass in the certain shapes they just think of good ideas
Now when you think of glass, you might think of colorful, shahooly designs or maybe Italian vases, but kids' challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of broken-hearted snakes and bacon boys, who you can see as meat vision
Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be in sighters knowledge
Kids already do a lot of learning from adults, and we have a lot to share
I think that adults should start learning from kids
Now I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd, teachers and students, and I like this analogy
It shouldn't just be a teacher at the head of the class and telling students do this, do that
The students should teach their teachers
Learning between grownups and kids should be reciprocal
The reality, unfortunately, is a little different, and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it
Now, if you don't trust someone you place restrictions on them, right? If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10% interest, she established on her last loan, I'm going with hold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back
True story, by the way
Now, adult seem to have, adult seem to have a prevenually restrictive attitude towards kids from every, don't do that, don't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use
His history points out regimes become impressive when they're fearful about keeping him in trouble
Although adults may not be quiet at the level of totalitarian regimes, kids have no or very little saying making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal, meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population
Now, what's even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids' abilities
We love challenges, but when expectations are low, trust me, we will sing to them
My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister
Okay, so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that, but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters
When lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round
Well, we heard that one too, but pioneer germ fighters totally rules
I love to write from the age of four, and when I was six, my mom bought me my own laptop equipment with Microsoft Word
Thank you Bill Gates, and thank you mom
I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop, and I wanted to get published
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that kid wanted to get published or saying wait until your older, my parents were really supportive
Many publishers were not quite so encouraging
and large children's publisher ironically saying they didn't work with children
Might want to, children's publisher not work with children
I don't know
You kind of alienating large client there
Now, one publisher, action publishing, was willing to take that leap and trust me
And to listen to what I had to say, they published my first book, Flying Fingers
You see it here
And from there on, it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools, keynote and the thousands of educators
And finally, today, speaking to you, I appreciate your attention today because to show that you truly care, you listen
But there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults
Kids grow up and become adults just like you
Or just like you, really? The goal is not to turn kids in the year kind of adult, but rather better adults than you has been, which may be a little challenging consider your guys credentials
But the way progress happens is because new generations and new era's grow and develop and become better than the previous ones
It's the reason we're not in the dark ages anymore
No matter your position or place in life, it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away
A Dalton fellow Tedsters, you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us
You must lend an ear today because we are the leaders of tomorrow
Which means we're going to be taking care of you and your old and senile
No, just kidding
Actually, no, really
We are going to be the next generation, the one who will bring this world forward
In case you don't think that this really has meaning for you, remember that cloning is possible, and that involves going through childhood again in which case you want to be heard just like my generation
Now the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas, kids need opportunities to lead and succeed
Are you ready to make the match? Because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom
Thank you
Thank you
So ladies and gentlemen, Ted, we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement
So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish in under three minutes, and I sex some lessons from it
First, of course, you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed
But what he's doing is so easy to follow
So here's his first follower with a crucial role
He's going to show everyone else how to follow
Now notice that the leader embraces him as an equal
So now it's not about the leader anymore
It's about them, plural
Now there he is calling to his friends
Now if you notice that the first follower is actually an under-estimated form of leadership in itself
It takes guts to stand out like that
The first follower is what transforms alone nut into a leader
And here comes a second follower
Now it's not a loan nut, it's not two nuts
Three is a crowd and the crowd is news
So a movement must be public
It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader
Now here come two more people and immediately after three more people
Now we've got momentum
This is the tipping point
Now we've got a movement
So notice that as more people join in, it's less risky
So those that we're sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to
They won't stand out
They won't be ridiculed, but they will be part of the in crowd if they hurry
So over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd, because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in
And that's how you make a movement
But let's recap some lessons from this
So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone
Remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals
So it's clearly about the movement, not you
Okay, but we might have missed the real lesson here
The biggest lesson if you noticed, did you catch it? Is it leadership is overglorified? That yes, it was the shirtless guy was first and he'll get all the credit
But it was really the first follower that transformed the loan nut into a leader
So as We're told that we should all be leaders that would be really ineffective
If you really care about starting a movement, have the courage to follow and show others how to follow
And when you find a loan nut doing something great, have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in
And what a perfect place to do that, Ted
Thanks
Thank you
We are drowning in news
Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year
That's just one source
My question is, how many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run? That's the idea behind the long news
It's a project by the long now foundation, which was founded by Ted Stras, including Kevin Kelly and Stuart Brand
And what we're looking for is news stories that lights film matter, 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now
I mean, look at the news through that filter, a lot falls by the wayside
If you take the top stories from the AP this last year, is this going to matter in a decade or this? Or this? Really? Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years? Okay, that was kind of cool
But the top story of this past year was the economy and I'm just betting that sooner or later this particular recession is going to be old news So what kind of stories might make a difference for the future? Well, let's take science Some day little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things That some days are already here if you're a mouse some recent stories is nanobis, aptumers with real B venom
Just sending genes into the brain, a robot they built that can crawl through the human body
What about resources? How are we going to feed 9 billion people who are having trouble feeding 6 billion today? As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry
Britain will start without genetically modified crops
Bill Gates fortunately has better billion on angry search
What about global politics? The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda and they may
They've overtaken the US as the world's biggest car market
They've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter
And they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers
We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know
Some recent discoveries
There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica
There's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery, soon science may no longer need us
And life may no longer need us either
A micro wakes up after 120,000 years
It seems that with or without us, life will go on
But my pick for the top long news to raise this past year was this one, water found on the moon
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there
And if NASA doesn't do it, China might, or somebody in this room might write a big check, My point is this, in the long run, some new stories are more important than others
APPLAUSE
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values
Now it's generally understood that questions of morality, questions of good and evil, and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion
It's a thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what we ought to value
And consequently, most people, I think most people probably hear, think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life
Questions like, what is worth living for? What is worth dying for? What constitutes a good life? So I'm going to argue that this is an illusion
The separation between science and human values is an illusion
And actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history
Now, it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation from morality and human values because science deals with facts
And facts and values seem to belong to different spheres
It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be
But I think this is quite clearly untrue
But values are a certain kind of fact
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks? Why don't we feel compassion for rocks? So we don't think rocks can suffer
And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates, then we are about insects as indeed we are
It's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering
Now, the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim
This is something we could be right or wrong about
And if we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibility of experience, well, then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects
There is no notion, no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes
Even if you get your values from religion, even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death, either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering and hell
You are still concerned about consciousness and its changes
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which of course may or may not be true
Now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings, we know that there's a continuum of such facts
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state
where everything that can go wrong does go wrong, where mothers cannot feed their children, where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration, where people are murdered indiscriminately, and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum toward something quite a bit more idyllic
I mean, to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable, and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space
It would add in cholera to the water be a good idea
We'll probably not
It would be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye, so that when bad things happen to them, they immediately blame their neighbors
Probably not
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand these truths, and morality relates to these truths
So in talking about values, we are talking about facts
Now, of course, our situation in the world can be understood at many levels
So from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements
But if we're going to talk about human well-being, we are of necessity talking about the human brain, because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain
Whatever happens after death
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 versions in the afterlife, in this life, his personality, his rather unfortunate personality, is the product of his brain
And so the contributions of culture have culture changes us as indeed it does
It changes us by changing our brains
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish, can at at least in principle, the understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind, neuroscience, psychology, et cetera
So what I'm arguing is that values reduced to facts, to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings
And I think of this as a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective
And one thing to note, this is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access, that few people access, and these await our discovery
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured, but other minds possibly could access them
Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying
I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space
We will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question
I don't think for instance that you will one day consult a super computer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb your wrongs nuclear facilities, or whether you can deduct the full cost of Ted as a business expense
But if questions affect human well-being, then they do have answers
whether or not we can find them
And just admitting this, just admitting that there are right-and-wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish, will change the way we talk about morality
And it will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future
In front of this, there are 21 states in our country where a corporal punishment in the classroom is legal, where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, I'm raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin
And hundreds of thousands of children incidentally are subjected to this every year
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you
We're not talking about Connecticut
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious
The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the riot, let's we spoil the child
This is in Proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23
But we can ask the obvious question
Is it a good idea, generally speaking, to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior? Is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters? Now, many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstrued
And so then held therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being? Well, consider by analogy the concept of physical health
I mean, the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spectre
It has changed over the years
When this statue was carved, the average life expectancy was probably 30
is now around 80 in the developed world
There may come a time when we metle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability
People send you donations when you're in that condition
Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does not make it vacuous
Okay, the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science
Now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape
There may be equivalent ways to thrive
There may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so it's to maximize human flourishing
Now why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality? Well, think of how we talk about food
I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food eat
This clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison
The fact that there are many right answers to the question, what is food? Does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition
Now, many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions
So for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie
And if you can find an exception, well, then there's no such thing as moral truth
Now why would we think this? Consider binology, the game chess
Now if you're going to play a good chess, a principle like don't lose your queen is very good to follow
But it clearly admits exceptions
There are moments where losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do
There are moments where it's the only good thing you can do
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity
The fact that their exceptions here does not change that at all
Now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere
consider the great problem of women's bodies
What to do about them? Well, this is one thing you can do about them
You can cover them up
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, a bar intellectual community, that, well, we might not like this
We might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto
Who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags
Who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way? Who are we not to say this? Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being, that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this? I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil
And women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned
But what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped, her father's first impulse, rather often, is to murder her out of shame? Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute
Your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing? Now, to say this, it's not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society
I mean for instance, this is what it's like to go to a new stand almost anywhere in the civilized world
Now granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images
But if we are in a reflective mood, we can ask, is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies? is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children? Probably not
OK, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance
OK? OK
Thank you
Perhaps there are many such places
Again, we'll give another changes in human culture
There may be many peaks on the moral landscape
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak
Now, the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me, and who think that there are right-and-wrong answers to moral questions, are religious demagogues of one former or another
And of course, they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind
Okay, not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being
In fact, the endurance of religion, as a lens through which most people view, moral questions, has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty, or any other hugely consequential issue
But the demigods are right about one thing
We need a universal conception of human values
Now, what stands in the way of this? Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about Morale, especially secular academic scientists types
When talking about Morale, we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives
So for instance, the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion
And he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raped being in torturing and killing young women
So we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time
Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say, well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama be really right about, really right about, or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about, that it mits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science
He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other
Now, notice that we don't do this in science
On the left, you have Edward Whitten
He's a string theorist
If you ask the smartest, physicists around, who's the smartest, physicists around in my experience, half of them will say, Ed Witten, the other half will tell you they don't like the question
So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus? It doesn't resonate with me
It's not how I choose to view the universe at the smallest scale
I'm not a fan
Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist
I don't understand string theory
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member
But this is just the point
Whenever we are talking about facts, certain opinions must be excluded
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise
That is what it is for knowledge to count
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere, there is no such thing as moral expertise, or moral talent, or moral genius, even? How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count? How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering? Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering? No
How is their ignorance? How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being? APPLAUSE So this, I think, is what the world needs now
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing
and morality relates to that domain of facts
It is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things, which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing
We live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented
It will always be easier to break things than to fix them
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you
So some combustible material there
Yeah
I'd rather in this audience, or people else were in the world, hearing some of this, they've all been doing the screaming with rage thing
Right
Right
Some of them
Language seems to be really important here
When you talk about the veil, you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags
You know, I've lived in the Muslim world, with a lot of Muslim women
And some of them would say something else, they would say, no, you know, this is a celebration of female specialist
It helps build that
And it's an expression, it's a result of the fact that, and this arguably a sophisticated psychological view that may or last, is not to be trusted
I mean, can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing kind of cultural imperialist? Yeah, well, I think this is, I tried to broach this in a sentence, watching the clock ticking
But the question is, what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and certain, and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't value yourself? And so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces, I mean, I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want
But we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under
And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it, especially and you want us to 120 degrees out and you're wearing a full burger
A lot of people want to believe in this, this concept of model progress
But can you reconcile that? I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional, where we have to think the same
Paint your picture of what, you know, rolling the clock 50 as forward, 100 as forward, how you would like to think of the world, balancing moral progress with richness
Well, I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain and some important detail, then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail
So we're going to understand positive social emotion, like empathy and compassion
And we're going to understand the factors that encourage it, whether they're genetic, whether they're how people talk to one another, whether they're economic systems
And so far as we begin to shine light on that, we are inevitably going to converge on that facts base
And so everything is not going to be up for grabs
It's not going to be like, you know, valen my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated in the context of men who do desire women
So I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that Vailing, Kuppelsbury Vailing is a bad idea
But at a certain point, we're going to be able to scan the brands of everyone involved and actually interrogate them
I mean, do people love their daughters just as much in these systems? And I think they're right, clearly right answers to that
And if the results come out that actually they do, are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues? Well yeah, Modulo, one obvious fact, that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system
So that you can say like, because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend, I chopped his head off
And that was the most compassionate thing I can do
If you get all those parts aligned, yes, I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love
But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context
And it's all of us in this together
It's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus
Sounds as a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours
We don't have that
Maybe another time
Thank you, Tim
Thanks, Tim
Really not
Thank you
Thank you
I grew up on steady diet of side-fiction
In high school, I took a bus to school, an hour each way, every day
And I was always absorbed in a book, side-fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this in an narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had
You know, that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I was in school, I was out in the woods hiking and taking samples of frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope
I was, you know, I was real science geek, but it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility
And my love of science fiction actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this was in the late 60s
We were going to the moon
We were exploring the deep oceans
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and all wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined
So that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it
And I was an artist
I could draw like a paint
And I found that because there were video games and the saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head
You know, we all did as kids having to read a book and through the author's description, put something on the screen, the movie screen in our heads
And so my response to this was to paint, to draw, Alien creatures, alien worlds, robots, spaceships, all that stuff I was endlessly getting busted in math class, you know, doodling behind the textbook
And that was the creativity had to find its outlet somehow
And an interesting thing happened, the Jacques Cousteau shows, and actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world, right here on earth
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday
That seemed pretty darn unlikely
But that was a world I could really go to, right here on earth, that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books
So I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada, 600 miles from the nearest ocean
But I didn't let that dawn me
I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo, New York, right across the border from where we live
Then I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo, New York
I didn't see the ocean a real ocean for another two years until we moved to California
And now since then, in the intervening 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater and 500 hours of that was in submersibles
And I've learned that that depotion environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination
Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination
I still to this day stand an absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives
And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing and just as strong as it ever was
But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images
And I was as a kid, constantly drawing comic books and so on
So filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together
And that made sense
And of course, the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories, Terminator, Aliens, and then the Abyss
And with the Abyss, I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with film making, so merging the two passions, something interesting came out of the Abyss, which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film, which was to create this kind of liquid water creature
We actually embraced computer-generated animation, CG
And this resulted in the first soft surface character CG animation that was ever in a movie
And even though filmed in making money, Barry Brokeven, I should say, I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic
Arthur Clark's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable for magic
They were seeing something magical
So that got me very excited
I thought, wow, this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art
With Terminator 2, which was my next film, we took that much farther, working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude in that film
The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work
did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience, although we did make a little more money on that one
So, you know, drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to this is going to be a whole new world
This is a whole new world of creativity for film artists
So I started a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston, who is the premier make up and creature designer at that time
And it was called digital domain
And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the kind of analog processes of optical printers and so on
And we would go right to digital production
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while
But we found ourselves lagging in the mid-90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do
So I wrote this piece called Avatar, which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects of CG effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG and the main characters that all being CG and the world would be in CG
And the envelope pushed back and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while
So I shelved it and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks
And you know, I went and pitched it to the studio as Romeo and Juliet on a ship
It's going to be this epic romance passionate film secretly what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of Titanic
And that's why I made the movie
And that's the truth
Now, the studio didn't know that, but I convinced that I said, I said, we're going to dive to the wreck, we're going to film it for real, we'll be using it in the opening of the film, it'll be really important, it'll be a great marketing hook and I talked them into funding and expedition
Sounds crazy, but this goes back to that theme about, you know, your imagination creating a reality
There's actually created a reality where at six months later I found myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the North Atlantic, looking at the real Titanic through a viewport, not a movie, not HD 4 real
And now that blew my mind
And it took a lot of preparation
We had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things
But it struck me how much this dive, these deep dives, was like a space mission, where it was highly technical and required enormous planning
And you get in this capsule, you go down to this dark, hostile environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself
And I thought, wow, I'm living in a science fiction movie
This is really cool
And so I really got bitten by the bug of depotion exploration
Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it
It was everything
It was adventure
It was curiosity, it was imagination
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me
I can imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it
But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions
I was seeing creatures that hide your thermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before, sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image them
So I was completely smitten by this and had to do more
So I actually made a Connecureist decision after the success of Titanic
I said, OK, you know, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker
And I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while
And so we started planning these expeditions
And we wound up going to the Bismarck and exploring it with robotic vehicles
We went back to the Titanic wreck
We took little bots that we had created
That's spooled a fiber optic
and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship, which had never been done
Nobody had ever looked inside the wrecked
It didn't have the means to do it
So we created technology to do it
So here I am now on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible and looking out at planks that look much like this where I knew that the band had played, then I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship
When I say, I'm operating it, but my mind is in the vehicle
I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic
And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had
Because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it
Because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie
And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprint of the ship
So it was this absolutely remarkable experience
And it really made me realize that, you know, tell the telepresence experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars
Then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle, into this other form of existence
It was really, really quite profound
And maybe a little bit of a glimpse to what might be happening, you know, some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means
And in many sort of post human futures that I can imagine has a science fiction fan
So having done these these expeditions and really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the depotion vents where we had these amazing, amazing animals
They're basically aliens right here on Earth
They live in an environment of chemocynthesis
They don't survive on sunlight based system the way we do
And so you're seeing animals that are living next to a 500 degree centigrade water plumes that you think they can't possibly exist
At the same time, I was getting very interested in space science as well
Again, it's the science fiction influence as a kid
And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA advisory board, planning actual space missions, going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmine biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things to actually go and fly to the International Space Station with our 3D camera systems
And this was fascinating, but what I wanted to do was bring space scientists with us into the deep and taking them down so that they had access
Asterbiologists, planetary scientists, people who are interested in these extreme file environments, taking them down to the events, and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on
So here we were making documentary films, but actually doing science and actually doing space science
I completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real
And, you know, along the way, in this journey of discovery, I learned a lot
I learned a lot about science, but I also learned a lot about leadership
Now you think directors got to be a leader, leader of Captain of the ship, all that sort of thing
I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions
Because I had to at a certain point say, what am I doing out here? Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it? We don't make money at these damn shows
We barely break even
There's no fame in it
people sort of think I went away between Titanic and Avatar and was buffing my nails someplace, sitting at the beach
Made all these films, made all these documentary films, that for a very limited audience
So no fame, no glory, no money
What are you doing? You're doing it for the task itself, for the challenge, and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is, for the thrill of discovery
And for that strange bond that happens, When a small group of people form a tightly-knit team, because we would do these things with 10, 12 people, working four years at a time
Sometimes that's C for two, three months at a time
And in that bond, you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a task, that you can't explain to someone else
When you come back to the show, and you say, we had to do this and the fiber optic and the attenuation that this and that all the technology of it and the difficulty, the human performance aspects of working at sea
You can't explain it to people
It's that thing that maybe cops have or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it
Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect
So when I came back to make my next movie, which was Avatar, I tried to apply that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return
It really changed the dynamic
So here I was again with a small team and an uncharted territory doing avatar, coming up with new technology that didn't exist before, tremendously exciting, tremendously challenging
And we became a family over a four and a half year period and it completely changed how I do movies
So people have commented on how, you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora
To me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business
the process itself that changed as a result of that
So what can we synthesize out of all this? What are the lessons learned? Well, I think number one is curiosity
It's the most powerful thing you own
Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality
And the respect of your team is more important and all the laurels in the world
I have young filmmakers come up to me and say, give me some advice for doing this
And I say, don't put limitations on yourself
Other people will do that for you
Don't do it to yourself
Don't bet against yourself
And take risks
And NASA has this phrase that they like
Failure is not an option
But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk
You have to be willing to take those risks
So that's the thought I would leave you with
Is it in whatever you're doing? Failure is an option, but fear is not
Thank you
Thank you
So what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's, maybe the world's longest running soberer, which is cricket, and may it run forever because it gives people like me a living
It's got everything that you'd want at normal so far, but I'd want it's got love, joy, happiness, sadness, tears, laughter, lots of deceit, intrigue, and all good soaps, it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes
And that's exactly what Cricket has done
It's jumped 20 years into it, 20 over game
And that's what I'm going to talk about
How a small change leads to a very big revolution
But we want all days like that
Creative wasn't always this speed driven generation's game
There was a time when you played, you played timeless test matches
When you played on till the game got over
And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March
And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town, which is a two-hour train journey to catch the ship that left on the 17th because the next ship wasn't around for a long time
So the match was ended in between
And one of the English batsman said, you know what, another half an hour and we would have won
And another half an hour after 12 days
There were two Sundays in between, but of course, Sundays are church days
So you don't play on Sundays
And one day it rains
So they all sat around making friends with each other
But there's a reason why India fell in love with cricket, because we had about the same pace of life
The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it? You fought by day, then it was sunset
So everyone went back home
And then you worked out your strategy and you came and fought the next end, and you went back home again
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day
Princess patronized the game, not because they loved the game, but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers
Because one other reason why India fell in love with cricket, which is all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball and any number of people could play it anywhere
Take a look
You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there
You could play it in little alley
You couldn't hit square anyway because the bat hit the wall
Don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires
You could play it on the banks of the Ganga
There's a cleanest the Ganga has been for a long time
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land, even if you didn't know which game you were actually in
As you can see, you can play anywhere, but slowly the game moved on
You know, finally, you don't always have five days
So we moved on and we started playing 50 over cricket and then an enormous accident took place
In Indian sport, we don't make things happen
Accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes
And we won this World Cup in 1983
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50 over game and we played it virtually every day
every day
There was more 50 of us cricket than anywhere, but there was another big date
1983 was when we won the World Cup, 1991, 1992, we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India
Rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery and disclosed country and so we allowed multinationals into India
We cut customs duties, reduced import duties and we got all the multinationals coming in with multinational budgets who looked at per capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian
And there's only two vehicles in India, one real one scripted
The scripted one is what you see in the movies, the real one was cricket
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me, Ravi Dharival from Pepsi decided he's going to take it all over the world and Pepsi was his big revolution because they started taking cricket all over
And so cricket started becoming big
Cricket started bringing riches in television started covering cricket for a long time
Television said, we won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it
Then he said, okay, the next try to solve for $55 million, the next try to solve for $612 million
So it's a bit of a bit of a curve that and then another big accident happened in our cricket
England invented 20 overs cricket and said the world must play 20 overs cricket
Just as England invented cricket and made the rest of the world play it
Thank God for them
And so India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see? India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup, but we were forced to play by an 8-1 margin and then something very dramatic happened
We got to the final and then this moment that will remain enshrined forever for everybody
Take a look
APPLAUSE The Pakistani basketball team is a
He's not the exact player! He's not the exact player! India win! What a match for a 2020 final, India, the World Champions! India T-20 champions
But what again we have? MS Dori got it right in the end, but Miss Balaq got a player
A massive success
India, the world, T-T champions
Suddenly India discovered this power of 20 over a cricket
The accident of course there was the batsman thought the bull was bullying fast
They had both fast, the ball would have gone, where it was bent to go, but it didn't go
And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game
And what it also did was it led to sort of pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world
It was at a time when investment was coming in, India was feeling a little more confident about itself
And so there was a feeling that this great pride in what we can do
And thankfully for all of us, the English are very good at inventing things
And the gracious people that they are, they let the world become very good at it
And so England invented the 20-cricket and allowed India to hide jacket
It was not like re-engineering that we do in medicine
We just took it straight away as is
And so we launched our own T20 League
Six weeks, city versus city, it was a new thing for us
We had only ever supported our country
The only two areas in which India was very proud about the country, representing itself on the field
was war, the Indian army, which you don't like to happen very often
The others Indian cricket
Now suddenly we had to support city leagues, but the people getting into these city leagues were people who take their cues from the west, America's a home of leagues
And they said, right, we'll build some glidzy leagues here in India
But it was India ready for it, because cricket for a long time in India was always organized
It was never promoted
It was never sold, it was organized
And look what they did with a beautiful, nice, simple family game
all of a sudden you are that happening
An opening ceremony to match every other
This was an India that was buying chorus, this is an India that was buying Jaguar, this in India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over
So it was a different India, but it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern, but didn't want to say that to people
And so they were aghast when the cheer leaders arrived
Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes
So I'm not bureaucrats who are forced into sport because they didn't actually love it
These were people who ran serious companies
And so they started promoting cricket big times, started promoting clubs, big time, and they started promoting them with huge money behind it
I mean, the IPL had $2
3 billion before a ball was bold
$1
6 billion for television revenue over 10 years and another $70 million plus from all these franchises that were putting in money and then they had to appeal to their cities, but they to do it like the West, right? Because we were setting up leagues
But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized
So just to give you an example of how they did it, not Manchester United style promotion, but very Mumbai style promotion
Take a look
Allaray
Allaray
Allaray
Allaray
Allaray
We rock the world
The world
The world like I'm gay
The world like I'm gay
We will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the We rock the world! Of course, a lot of people said, maybe they danced better than they played
But that's alright
What it did also was it changed the way we looked at cricket
All along, if you wanted a young cricket, you picked them up from the bylayants of your own little locality, your own city, and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers
Now, all of a sudden, if you were a bowl of shot, if Mumbai were a bowl of shot, for example, they didn't go to Kalwadivi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them, they could go to Trinidad
This was the new India wasn't it? This is the new world where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product of the best price
And all of a sudden Indians spotted a vehicle to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world
So the Mumbai Indians flew in to do an bravo from Trinidad and Tobago overnight
And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies, they asked him, when do you have to reach? He said, I have to be there by a certain time
So I have to leave today
And he said, no, no, no
It's not about when you have to leave
It's about when you have to reach there
And so he said, I've got to reach on date X, and they said, fine, you play date X minus 1
So he played in Hyderabad when straight after the game, went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport, sat in a private corporate jet, first refueling in Portugal, second refueling in Brazil, he was investing these in time
Never would India have thought on this scale before
Never would India have said, I want a player to play one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet to send them all the way back to Kingston Jamaica to play a game
And I just thought to myself, wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know? We've arrived somewhere, we're thinking big
But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket, which was cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment
The cricket and the movies, and they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs
And so, people started going to the cricket to watch the presenter, they started going to the cricket to watch Sharo Khan, and something very interesting happen
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more
And of course if you're in pretty zinters team, as you will see on the clip that follows, if you did well, you got a hug from pretty zinters
So that was the ultimate reason to do well
Take a look
Everyone watching pretty zinters
And then of course there was Shahrukh playing the Kolkata crowd
We were all seen matches in Kolkata
We didn't ever see anything like this
Shahrukh with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata, not for India, but for Kolkata
But take a look at this
And Indian film star Hugginger Pakistan, Ikrigeta, because at one in Kolkata, Chen you Imagine
And you wrote the Pakistani cricket as in? I wish I was playing for previous intersting
But I thought I'd take this opportunity
There's a few people from Pakistan in here
I'm so happy that you're here because I think we can show that we can work together and be friends, right? We can play cricket together, we can be friends
So thank you very much for coming
All of you from Pakistan
There was criticism too, because they said players are being bought and sold are they green? Are they cattle? Because we had this auction, you see, how do you fix a price for a player? And so the auction that followed literally had people saying bang, so many million dollars for so-and-so player, there it is
The first time I've ever seen a big one-minute video, I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
I've been watching it for a long time
international, the top of the line player, central contracts are $220,000 in a whole year
Now they're getting 500,000 for six days work
Then Andrew Flintov came by from England
He got a $1
5 million and he went back and said, for four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Stephen Gerard and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow
And where was he earning it from? Probably a little club in India
Could you have imagined that day would come? $1
5 million for six weeks? Well, that's not bad, isn't it? So, as at $2
3 billion before the first ball was bold, what India was doing, there was benchmarking itself against the best in the world and it became a huge brand
Lalit Modi was on the cover of business today, IPL began the biggest brand in India
And because of our elections, had to be moved to South Africa and we had to start the tournament in three weeks
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks
But we did it
You know why? country in the world works as slowly as we do three weeks before an event and nobody works as fast as we do in the last three weeks
A population which for a long time we thought was a problem suddenly became our biggest asset because the more people watching the huge consumer in class everybody came to watch the cricket, but also made cricket the only sport in India, which is a pity, but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big, which is a bit of tragedy of our times
Now, just last minute before I go, there's a couple of side effects of all this
For a long time, India was this country of poverty, dust, beggars, snake charmers, fields, Delhi, Delhi, people wrote Delhi, Delhi stories before they came, and all of a sudden India was this land of opportunity
said, you know, we love India, we love to play in India
And that felt good, you know? We said, but dollar is quite powerful, actually
Can you imagine you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi, Delhi, India anymore
There's no field, there's no beggars, all the snake, charmers have vanished, everybody's gone
This tells you how the capitalist world rules
Right? So, finally, an English game that India you serve to little bit, but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world
If you want to take the game around the world, it's got to be the shortest form of the game
You can't take a timeless test to China and say, play 14 days with no result in the end or you can't take it all over the world
So that's what T20 is doing
Hopefully it'll make everyone richer
Hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket comment it has more time in the business
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is
Autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe
The child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers
And I actually feel at home here because there's a lot of autism genetics here
You wouldn't have any
It's a continuum of traits
When does nerd turn into an ass burger, which is just mild autism? I mean Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today
And one of the things that really is going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things
Now that Bill Gates talked about this morning
Okay, now if you want to understand autism animals and I want to talk to you about different ways of thinking, you have to get away from verbal language
I think in pictures, I don't think in language
Now the thing about the autistic mind is, it tends to detail, okay? This is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly
And the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details
Well, if you're building up bridge, details are pretty important because I'm fall down if you ignore the details
And one of my big concerns is a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract
People are getting away from doing hands-on stuff
I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because aren't and classes like that
Those are the classes where I excel
OK, in my work with cattle, I notice a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle block
Like for example, this flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility
This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility
All they needed to do was move the flag
Rapid movement contrast
In the early 70s, when I started, I got right down in the shoots to see what cattle were seeing
People thought that was crazy
A coat on a fence would make them block
Shadows would make them block
A hose on the floor
People weren't noticing these things
A chain hanging down
And that's shown very, very nicely in the movie
In fact, I loved the movie, how they duplicated all my projects
That's the geek side
My drawings got the star in the movie, too
And actually, it's called Temple Grand and Not Thinking and Pictures
So what is thinking in pictures? It's literally movies in your head by mind works like Google for images
Now, when I was a young kid, I didn't know my thinking was different
I thought everybody thought in pictures
And then when I did my book thinking in pictures, I started interviewing people about how they think
And I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different
Like if I say, think about a church people, most people get this sort of generalized generic one
Now maybe that's not true in this room, but it's going to be true in all of a lot of different places
I see only specific pictures
They flash up into my memory just like Google for pictures
And in the movie, they've got a great scene in there, where the word, shoe is said, and a whole bunch of 50s and 60s shoes pop into my imagination
OK, there's my childhood church that's specific
There's some more for columns
OK, how about famous ones? And they just kind of come up kind of like this, just really quickly, like Google for pictures
And they come up one at a time
And then I can think, well, OK, well, maybe we can have a snow or we can have a thunderstorm
I can hold it there and turn them into videos
Now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities
And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at slaughter plant
I'm not going to go in any gucky slaughter slides
I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it
But one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind, just like a virtual reality computer system
And this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie
That was just so super cool
And there were a lot of kind of asperger types
and I had an autism type working out there on the movie set too
But one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids go on today? They're not ending up in Silicon Valley where they belong
Now, one of the things I learned very early on, because I wasn't that social, is I had to sell my work and not myself
And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings, I showed off pictures of things
Another thing that helped me is a little kid is boy and the 50s you would taught manners
You would taught you can't pull the merchandise off of shelves in the store and throw it around
Now, when kids get to be in third or fourth grade, you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker, drawing in perspective
Now, I want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker
Now, I did the head of brain scan done several years ago, And I used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex
This is tensor imaging
And my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the controls
The red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age-mashed control
And there I got a gigantic one and the control over there
The blue one has got a really small one
And some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex
Now, the thing is the visual thinkers just one kind of mind
You see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind
Good at one thing, bad at something else
And where I was bad was algebra
And I was never allowed to take geometry or trig
Geigentic mistake
I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra, go write to geometry and trig
Now, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker
or abstract these ear engineers, your computer programmers
Now this is pattern thinking that praying madness is made from a single sheet of paper
No Scotch tape, no cuts, and there in the background is the pattern for folding it
Here are the types of thinking
Photo-realistic visual thinkers like me
Pattern thinkers, music, and math minds
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading
You also will see these kind of problems with them
Kids that are dyslexic
you'll see these different kinds of minds
And then there's a verbal mind
They know every fact about everything
Now another thing is the sensory issues
I was really concerned about having a world as gadget on my face
And I came in half an hour before hand, so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it
And they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin
But since recent issues, some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights
Others have problems with sound sensitivity
You know, it's going to be very elaborate
Now, visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind, because think about it
An animal, the sensory-based thinker, not verbal
Thinks in pictures
Thinks in sounds
Thinks in smells
Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant
He knows who's been there
When they were there, are they friend or foe? Is there anybody in gold mate with? There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant
It's all very detailed information
And look at these kind of details
Give me a lot of insight into animals
Now, the animal mind, and also my mind, puts sensory-based information into categories
Man on a horse and a man on a ground, that is viewed as to totally different things
You can have a horse that's been abused by a rider
They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horse sure, but you can't ride them
You have another horse where maybe they horse shoeer beat them up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian
But a person can ride him, cattle of the same way
Man on a horse, a man on foot, there are two different things
You see it's a different picture
You see, I want you to think about just how specific this is
Now, this ability to put information into catacories
I find a lot of people are not very good at this
Like when I'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plan, they don't see me able to figure out do I have a training people issue or do I have something wrong with the equipment? Now, there's categorizing
Women problem from a people problem
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that
Now let's say I figure out is an equipment problem? Is it a minor problem with something simple I can fix or is a whole design of a system wrong? People have a hard time figuring that out
Just look at something like solving problems with, you know, making airlines safer
Yeah, I'm a million mile flyer
I do lots and lots of flying
And, you know, like if I was at the FFA, what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of, it would be their airplane tails
You know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years, tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way
It's tails
Pure and simple
And when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what? I can't see that stuff inside the tail
Now as I think about that, I'm pulling up all of that, you know, specific information
It's specific
See, my thinking's bottom up
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle
Now here's a horse that was definitely afraid of black cowboy hats
You've been abused by somebody where the black cowboy hat
White cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine
Now the thing is, the world is gonna need all of the different minds to work together
We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds
And one of the things that's driving me really crazy is I travel around that I do autism meetings
I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids
And they just aren't very social
And nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science
This brings up the whole thing on my science teacher
My science teacher has shown absolutely beautifully in the movie as a goofball student When I was in high school, I just didn't care at all about studying
Until I had Mr
Carlox science class, he was now Dr
Carlox in the movie
And he got me challenged to figure out not to call a losing room
This brings up the whole thing
He got a show kid's interesting stuff
One of the things that I think maybe Ted ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on Ted
There's all kinds of great stuff on the internet to get these kids turned on
Because I'm saying a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas, they don't know what to do with these kids
And they're not going down the right path
The thing is, you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind, or a mind can be wired to be more social
And what some of the research now is shown autism is that maybe extra wiring back here and then really brilliant mind
And we lose a few social circuits here
It's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social
And then you can get into the point where it's so severe, you're going to have a person that's going to be nonverbal
In the normal human mind, language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals
This is the work of Dr
Bruce Miller
And he studied Alzheimer's patients, that frontal temporal lobe dementia
And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain
And then this artwork came out of somebody that used to install stereos and cars
Now, Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics
But I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this Eddie Pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence
Springs up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head
And the Wolfram stuff I was taking notes and I was writing down all the search words I could use because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures We've got to show these kids interesting stuff
And they've taken out the auto shop class and the draft and class and the art class
I mean, art was my best subject in school
We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds
And we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future
And let's talk about jobs
OK, my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball that didn't want to study
But you know what? I was getting work experience
I'm seeing too many smart kids that haven't learned basic things
Like how to be on time, I was taught that when I was eight years old
You know how to have table manners, a granny's, a Sunday party
I was taught that when I was very, very young
And when I was 13, I had a job at a dress makers shop by selling clothes
I did internships in college
I did, I was building things
And I also had to learn how to do assignments
You know, all I want to do is draw pictures
The horses went off as little
Mother said, well, let's do a picture something else
They gotta learn how to do something else
Let's say the kids fixated on Legos
Let's get them working on building different things
The thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated
Like if the kid loves race cars, let's use race cars for math
Let's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance
In other words, use that fixation in order to motivate that kid
That's one of the things we need to do
really get fed up on the teachers, especially when you get away from this part of the country
They don't know what to do with these smart kids
It just drives me crazy
What can visual thinkers do when they grow up? They can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers, photography, industrial design, the pattern thinkers, they're the ones that are going to be mathematicians, you're software engineers, you're computer programmers, all of those kinds of jobs, and then you've got the word minds
They make great journalists
And they're also make really really good stage actors
Because the thing about being autistic is I had to learn social skills like being in a play
It's just kind, it's just half to learn it
And we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors
You know, my science teacher was not in a credited teacher
He was a NASA space scientist
Now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or degree in chemistry, you can come into the school and teaching all by all of your chemistry
We need to be doing that because what I'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges
But we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools
Another thing that can be very, very, very, very successful is there's a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry
And they can teach a kid
And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old
Because what you're doing is lighting the smart
to get net kid turned on
And you get them turned on, then you'll learn all the new stuff
Mentors are just essential
I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me
And we've got to mentor them, hire them
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies, the thing about the autism aspergery kind of mind, you've got to give them a specific task
Don't just say design new software
You've got to tell them something a lot more specific
Well, we're designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory
That's kind of specificity you need
Well, let's see end of my talk and I just want to thank everybody for coming
It was great to be here
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you so much for that
You know, you once wrote, I like this quote, if by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth, then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave
Because, who do you think made the first stone spheroes? A iceberg or a guy, and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics, they'd know more silicon valley, and the energy crisis would not be solved
So, I want to ask you a couple of the questions
And if any of these feel inappropriate, it's okay to say next question
But if there's someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them, what advice would you give them? Well, first of all, we gotta look at age
If you have a two, three, a four-year-old, no speech, no social interaction
I can't emphasize enough, don't wait
You need at least 20 hours a week of one to one teaching
But the thing is autism comes in different degrees
There's going about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn a talk and they're not going to be working on Silicon Valley
That would not get reasonable thing for them to do
But then you get these smart geeky kids, touch of autism
And that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things
I got social interaction through shared interests
I wrote horses with other kids
I made model rockets with other kids
Did electronic slab without the kids
In the 60s it was gluing on Mirrors on the Rubber membrane on speaker to make a light show
That was like, we can serve that super ball
Is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that child loves them as some might? Well, let me tell you that child will be loyal and if a house is burning down they're going to get you out of it
Well, so most people, if you ask them what are they most passionate about, they'd say things like my kids or my lover or what are you most passionate about? I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place
When I have a mother of an autistic child say, my kid went to college because of your book or something or one of your lectures, that makes me happy
You know, the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s, they were absolutely awful
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes
How many cattle fell down? How many cattle that pulled with the prodder? how many cattle are moving their heads off
And very, very simple, you directly observe a few simple things
It's worked really well
I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world
We need a lot more of that, and a lot less abstract stuff
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Well, the reason why I got really excited and I read about that, it's contains knowledge
It's libraries
And to me, knowledge is something that is extremely valuable
So maybe over 10 years ago now, our library got flooded
And this is for the internet got really big enough
It's really upset about the bookspin, right? Because it was knowledge being destroyed
And server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge
Temple, can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you attached
Well, thank you so much
Thank you
So imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America
And a Japanese man comes up to you and says, excuse me, what is the name of this block? And he say, I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street
This is 26, that's 27th
He says, okay, but what is the name of that block? He say, well, blocks don't have names
Streets have names
Blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets
He leaves a little confused and disappointed
So now imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in Japan
You turn to a person next to you and say, excuse me, what is the name of this street? They say, oh, well, that's block 17, and this is block 16
And you say, okay, but what is the name of this street? They say, well, streets don't have names
Block's have names
Just look at Google Maps here
There's block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
All of these blocks have names
streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks
And he said, OK, then how do you know your home address? I said, well, easy
This is district 8
There's a block 17 house number one
And I say, OK, but walking around the neighborhood, I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order
So, of course, they do
They go in the order in which they were built
The first house ever built on a block is house number one
The second house ever built is house number two
Third is house number three
It's easy
It's obvious
So I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had and realize that the opposite of them they also be true
So for example, there are doctors in China who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy
So any month you are healthy, you pay them
And when you're sick, you don't have to pay them because they failed at their job
They get rich when you're healthy, not sick
And in most music, we think of the one as the downbeat, beginning of the musical phrase, one, two, three, four
But in West African music, the one is thought of as the end of the phrase, like the period at the end of a sentence
So you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music, two, three, four, one
And this map is also accurate
There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India, the opposite is also true
So let's never forget whether it Ted or anywhere else, that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear, that the ups it may also be true
Don't worry, I'm going to go to the museum
Thank you
Right now is the most exciting time to see New Indian Art
Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before
I thought it might be interesting even for the many long time collectors here with us ahead local collectors to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists I wish everyone had to know
First is Barthi Care
The central motif of Barthese practice is the ready-made, store-bought bindi that untold millions of Indian women applied their foreheads every day, and it act closely associated with the institution of marriage
But originally, the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world
Barthese seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it, by exploding it into something spectacular
She also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals, which she then completely covers in bindies, often with potent symbolism
She says she first got started with 10 packets of bindies and then wondered what she could do with 10,000
Our next artist, Bala Subramanian, really stands at the crossroads of sculpture painting and installation, working wonders with fiberglass
Since Bala and self-luby speaking a tad, I won't spend too much time on him here today, except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible
Brooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh is known for her digital collages using Indian comic books called Amar Chitra Katas as her primary source material
These comics are a fundamental way that children, especially in the diaspora, learn their religious and mythological folktales
for when we're steeped in these
Chitra basically remixes and retitles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics
And she uses this vocabulary and her installation work as well
Jithosh Colett successfully practices across photography, sculpture, painting, and installation
As you can see, he's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art, and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work
He really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban bombay
He also creates fantastic, historic sculptures made of bones from cast resin
Here he envisions the carcass of an auto rickshaw he wants witnessed burning in a riot
This next artist, Ennis Hirshah, actually has a studio right here in Mysore
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition
He creates these fine delicate images, which he then repeats in a massive scale
He uses scale to more and more spectacular fact, whether on the roof of the Temple in Singapore, or it is increasingly ambitious installation work here with 192 functioning sewing machines fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations
Mumbai based through Vyacharya builds on her love of comic books in street art to comment on the role as an expectation of modern Indian women
She too minds the rich source material of Amar Chitra Kata's but a very different way than Chitra Ganesh
In this particular work, she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen and provocative
Heapshah is Kolk at the borne, Kashmir raised and London trained
He too is reinventing the miniature tradition
He creates these opulent tableaux inspired by Herodomus Bosch, but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth
He actually applies metallic industrial pains to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich, detailed effect
I'm kind of cheating with this next artist since Rax Media Collective are really three artists working together
Rax are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in India today, working across photography, video, and installation
They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work
Here they invite the viewer to analyze a crime, looking at evidence, includes embedded in five narratives on these five different screens, in which the city itself may have been the culprit
This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art, Sabaud Gupta
It was first known for creating giant photorealistic canvases paintings of everyday objects, stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian
He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally, and an agrander and grander scale by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations
And finally, number 10
Last and certainly not least, Rungi Shatar, who lives in works here in the state of Karnataka, creates etherealist cultures and installations that really matter either organic to the industrial and brings lexibode, the local global
These are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye
And she ranges them so that if you actually have to navigate through the space and interact with the objects
and light and shadow are a very important part of her work
She also explores themes of consumerism and the environment, such as in this work, where these basket-like objects look organic and woven and are woven
But with the strips of seal, salvaged from cars that she found in a Bangalore junkyard
10 artists, six minutes
I know that was a lot to take in, but I can only hope I've wet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things happening in art in India today
Thank you very much for looking and listening
In 2008, cyclone nervous devastated Myanmar
Millions of people were in severe need of help
The UN wanted to rush people and supplies to the area, but there were no maps, no maps of roads, no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London, it is hard to believe that as of 2005, only 15% of the world was mapped to a geocordable level of detail
The UN ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world's populous faces, not having detailed maps
But help us coming
At Google, 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads, 3,000 hospitals, logistics, and relief points, and it took them four days
Then you software they used Google Map Maker
Google Map Maker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally
People have used this software to map everything from roadsterevers, from schools, to local businesses and video stores to the corner store
Maps matter, Nobel Prize nominee Hernandez Dissoto recognized that the key to economic lift off for our most developing countries is to tap their vast amounts of uncapped lies land
For example, a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapped lies in India alone
In the last year alone, thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information and created a map of a level of detail, never thought viable
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere
Let's look at some of the maps being created by users right now
So as we speak, people are mapping the world in these 170 countries
You can see Bridget in Africa, who just mapped your road in Sanical, and closer to home, Chalua in M
G
Road in Bangalore
This is the result of computation geometry, gesture recognition, and machine learning
This is a victory of thousands of users in hundreds of cities, one user, one editor time
This is an invitation to the 70% of our unmap planet
Welcome to the new world
Thank you
The next question is, what is the answer to the question? The question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, the question is, So the question is, why only them? In a country of a billion people and some, why so few? Is it luck? Is it chance? Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected? So in the next eight minutes, I would like to share with you my story
I got infected when I was 17
When as a student of the design college, I encountered it does, who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt and how contagious that feeling was
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven
So when I started Riverside School 10 years ago, it became a lab, a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the eye can bug
And I uncovered that of learning is embedded in real world context
That is if you blur the boundaries between school and life, Then children go through a journey of aware where they can see the change, enable, be changed, and then empower, lead the change
And that directly increased student wellbeing
Children became more competent and less helpless
But this is all common sense
So I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside
A little background
When my grade five was learning about child rights, They were made to roll in San Sticks, Agarbatis, for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer
They transform them
What you will see is their journey and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world
It's a test day going and then two hours after their backs broke they were changed
And once that happened they were out in the city
People in every body that child labor just had to be abolished
And look at Raghav, that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has Shifted that man's mindset
And that can happen in a classroom
So when Raghav experienced that, he went from teacher to me to I am doing it
And that's the I can mind shift and it is a process that can be energized and nurtured But we had parents who said okay making our children good human beings is all very well But what about math and science and English? She was a great and we did their data was Conslusive when children are empowered not only do they do good They do well in fact very well as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over to 1000 schools in India, riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math English and science
Sir, it worked
It was now time to take it outside Riverside
So in August 15, independence day, 2007, the children of Riverside set out to infect M
the Bad
Now, it was not about Riverside school
It was about all children
So we were shameless
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police, the press, business And basically said, when are you going to wake up and recognize a potential that resides in every child? When will you include the child in the city? Basically open your hearts and your minds to the child
So how did the city respond? Since 2007, every other month, the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic, and converts it into a playground for children and childhood
Here was a city telling its child, you can
A glimpse of infection in M
the bath
So the busiest street goes down, we've had the traffic police and the recovery in helping us
We'll get to take an over
I chill
They are skating
They are doing street plays
They are playing
All three
For all children
Children Hi, good morning
A coach is an organization with doing things for kids earlier and we plan to extend this with a positive city
Good, good, good
It's just a good three time
And I'm about to go the first child's in the world
In the world
The two better you win, a city gets to the children in the future, the children will get back to the city
And because of that, M
D
Bad is known as India's first child friendly city
So you're getting the pattern
First 200 children at Riverside, then 30,000 children at the N
M
Bad and growing, it was time now to infect India
So on August 15, again, in the Pennies Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, I can
How? We designed a simple toolkit, converted into eight languages, and reached 32,000 schools
We basically gave children a very simple challenge
We said, take one idea, anything that bothers you, choose one week, and change a billion lives
And they did
Stories of change poured in from all over India
From Nagaland in the east to Junjunu in the west, from Sikkim in the north to Krishna getting in the south
Children were designing solutions for the diverse range of problems, right from loneliness, the filling pot holes on the street to alcoholism, and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan
I mean, it was incredible
Basically again, reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say, you can then they will infection in India
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village
I am not a person, I am not a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am a person, I am I was very happy that I didn't have to talk to her
I didn't have to talk to her
I will not talk to her
I will not talk to her
I will not talk to her
Why did I talk to her? I have a situation in Hyderabad
Piety one, you have to buy a 51, 55, you have to start
Girls and boys and Hyde are going out pretty difficult but they did it
I have to say this is so small that it is not so good today
Today is the society clean up our Hyderabad
Hyderabad will be the first one to come
It was a revelation for me
It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside
We have some wonderful things for you
We're already good thoughts
The money you give us will be used to our love and peace
I'm ready ladies and gentlemen
Are you ready? Yes! Happy New Year! The charter of the fashion status right here, street plays, auctions, petitions, and they are changing lives
It is incredible
So how can these days stay mute? How can we stay mute in that passion, that energy, that excitement? I know it's obvious, but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji
70 years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of we can
So today, who is going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India? India
Last I heard the preamble still said, we the people of India, right? So if not us, then who? If not now, then when? Like I said, contagious is a good word
Thank you
I'm Namaste Salam
Salam, Sustriq Al, greetings to all of you from Pakistan
It is often said that we fear that which we do not know
And Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar because it has provoked and does provoke a visceral Visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul, especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens of turbulence and turmoil
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan and what follows is a stream of images, a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's most dynamic and young photographers that aims to give you an alternative glimpse
A look inside the hearts and minds of some ordinary Pakistani citizens, here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you
My name is Abdul Khan, I come from Peshawar
I hope that you will be able to see not just my Daliban like beard, but also the richness and color of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams, as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell
My name is Meher and this is my friend, Irram
I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that I live in near Gilgit, Northern Pakistan
My name is Skylash, and I like to enrich lives through technical advice
Madden, would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots? My name is Zaman, and I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person from SWAT
Do you see me on the other side of this fence? Do I matter or really exist for you? My name is Eman, I am a fashion model, up and coming model from Lahore
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth? Or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who I truly am inside? My name is Ahmad, I am of God and refugee from the reiber agency
I have come from a place of intense darkness and that is why I want to illuminate the world
My name is Papal Se, my heart and drum beat is one
If religion is the opium of the masses, then for me, music is my one and only ganja
A rising tide lifts all boats, and the rising tide of India's spectacular economic growth has lifted over 400 million Indians into a buoyant middle class, but there are still over 650 million Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankan, Bangladesh, and Nepalis, who remain washed up on the shores of poverty
Therefore, as India and Pakistan as UNI, it behooves us to transcend our differences, to celebrate our diversity, to leverage our common humanity
Our collective vision at Najjivan, which for many of you, as you will recognize means new life in Urdu and Hindi, is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low-income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic healthcare
Indeed, it is the emerging world's first urban HMO for the urban working poor
Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis? We are about two threads cut from the same cloth
And if we are fates are intertwined, then we believe that it is good karma
It is good fortune
And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid
Thank you
APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Fantastic
This is a
You say up me
That was fantastic
I found that really moving
We fought hard to get at least a small Pakistani contingent to come
It was felt like it was really important
They went through a lot to get here
With the Pakistanis, please stand out, please
I just really want to acknowledge you
Thank you so much
So now, there are a lot of web 2
0 consultants who make a lot of money
In fact, they make their livings on this kind of stuff
I'm going to try to save you all the time and all the money and go through it in the next three minutes
So bear with me
Start a website back in 2005 with a few friends of mine called Reddit
com
That's what you call a social news website
Basically, all that means is the Democratic front page of the best stuff on the web
You find some interesting content, say Ted Talk, similar to Reddit, and the community of your peers will load it up
if they like it though to down if they don't
And that creates the front page
It's always rising and falling, always changing, about half million people visit every day
But this isn't about Reddit
This is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web
Because over the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes, all kinds of trends, get born right on our front page
But this isn't even about Reddit
It's actually about humpback whales
Well, technically it's actually about green peace
Switches in environmental organization that want to stop the Japanese government on their whaleing campaign
These humpback whales were getting killed
They wanted it, put an end to it
And one of the ways I wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales
But to really kind of personify the movement, they wanted to name it
So in true web fashion, they put together a poll where I had a bunch of very erudite, very thoughtful, cultured names
Believe this is a Farsi word for a mortal
I think this means divine power of the ocean in Polynesian language
And then there was this, Mr
Splashy pants
And this was especially, Mr
Pants or Splashy to his friends was very popular on the internet
In fact, someone on Reddit thought, oh, what a great thing
We should all vote this up
And you know, it, Redditers responded and all agreed
So the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves
We changed our logo for the day from the alien to a splashy to sort of help the cause
And it wasn't long before other sites like Farck and Boeing Boeing and the rest of the internet started saying, yes, we love splashy pants
So it went from about 5%, which was when this meme started to 70%
At the end of voting
Which is pretty impressive, right? We won, Mr
splashy pants was chosen
just kidding
Okay, so Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win
So they said, no, no, no, we're just kidding
We'll give it another week of voting
Well, that got us a little angry
So we changed it to fight in splashy
And the Reddit community really, and the rest of the internet, rather, really got behind this Facebook groups
We're getting created
Facebook applications were getting created
The idea was, vote your conscience vote for Mr
splashy pants
And people were putting up signs in the real world about this well
And this is the final vote
When it all was cleared, 78% of the votes and giving out the other landslide, the next highest name pulled in three, okay? So there was a clear lesson here
And that was the internet, love Mr
Spashe pants, which is obvious
It's a great name
Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say, Mr
Spashe pants
And I think that's what helped drive this
But what was cool was the repercussions now for Greenpeace was they created an entire marketing campaign around
They saw Mr
Spashe pants shirts and pins, they even created an e-carts
You could send your friend a dancing splashy
But what was even more important was was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission
Japanese government called off their willing expedition, mission accomplished
Greenpeace was thrilled, the whales were happy
That's a quote
And actually, the redditers in the internet community were happy to be, but they weren't whale lovers
A few of them certainly were
We're talking about a lot of people who were just really interested in really caught up in this great meme
And in fact, someone from Greenpeace came back in the site and thanked for it for their participation
But this wasn't really out of altruism
This was just out of interest in doing something cool
And this is kind of how the internet works
This is that great big secret, because the internet provides this level playing field
Your link is just as good as your link, which is just as good as my link
As long as we have a browser, anyone can get to any website, know about how big a budget you have, that is as long as we can keep an neutrality in place
The other important thing is that it costs nothing to get that content online now
There are so many great publishing tools that are available
It only takes a few minutes of your time to actually produce something, and a cost of duration is so cheap that your mind is won't give it a go
And if you do, be genuine about it
Be honest, be upfront
And one of the great lessons that Greenpeace actually learned was that it's okay to lose control
And so, Katie, take yourself a little less seriously, given that, even though it's a very serious cause, you could ultimately achieve your final goal
And that's the final message that I want to share with all of you is that you can do a online, but no longer is the message you're going to be coming from just the top down
If you want to succeed, you've got to be okay
It's just loose control
Thank you
Thank you
Good morning
I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering
It really is a story of Dr
Venkatas Fami, his mission and his message about the Arab and Ike system
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is, should be blind
The first thing that we have to do is to make sure that the people who are in the same place are in the same place
The first thing we have to do is to make sure that the people who are in the same place are in the same place
The first thing we have to do is to make sure that the people who are in the same place are in the same place
The first thing we have to do is to make sure that the people who are in the same place are in the same place
their independence and the status in the family
So she's just one amongst the millions who are blind and the irony is that they don't need to be a simple well proven surgery can restore sight of millions and something even simpler a pair of glasses can make millions more see
If you add to that the many of us here know who are more productive because we have a pair of glasses Then almost one in five Indians will require a staggering 20 million people
Today we are reaching not even 10 percent of them
So this is the context in which Arvan came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of Dr
V
We started this with no money, had to mortgage all these life savings to make a bank loan
And the whole time we have grown into a network of five hospitals predominantly in the state of Tamil Nadu and the Pondicherry
And then we added several what we call as vision centers and as a hub and spoke a model
And then more recently we started managing a hospital in other parts of the country and also setting a hospital in other parts of the world as well
So the last three decades we have done about 300-2 million surgeries, a vast majority of them for the poor people
Now each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries
A typical day at Aravan, we would do about 1,000 surgeries, maybe see about 6,000 patients
send out teams into the villages to examine bring back patients, lots of telemedicine consultations and on top of that, do a lot of training, both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of our event
And then doing this day in and day out and doing it well requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work
I think this was possible, thanks to the building blocks, put in place by Dr
V, a value system, efficient delivery process, and fostering the culture of innovation
I used to sit with the order of the revealed command because I have from a village and suddenly turned down and then you see it seem to content as inner being
You seem to be one with him
But here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence, doctor whatever you say accepted and implicit faith in you and then you respond it
Here is our old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her
When the growing spiritual consciousness we are into ourselves with all that is involved
So there is no exploitation
It is ourselves here helping
It is ourselves we are dealing
This helped us build a very ethical and a very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it
But in a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently
And audit may seem the inspiration came from McDonald's
That is simple
They feel they can train people, all over the world, it has to have different religions, different culture, different all those things
To produce a product in the same way and in the same manner in hundreds of places
He kept talking about McDonald's and hamburgers
None of it made any sense to us
He wanted to create a franchise, a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's
Suppose you're able to produce eye care techniques when they're losing the same V and make it available in every corner of the world
The problem of blindness is gone
think about it, I think the eyeball is the same, I'm American and in the African, the problem is the same, the treatment is the same and yet, there is so much variation in quality and in service and that is the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems
And of course, the challenge was that it is a huge problem, talking of millions of people, very little resource to deal with it, and then lots of logistics and affordability issues
And then so one had to constantly innovate
And one of the early innovations which still continues is to create ownership in the community to the problem, and then engage with them as a partner
And here is one such event, a community camp, which is organized by the community themselves where they find a place, organize volunteers, and then we do our part
Check the vision, and then you have doctors who do, you find out what the problem is, and then determine what further tests needs to be done
And those tests are done by technicians, who check for glasses or check for glaucoma
And then with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis and then a discerning line of treatment
And if the need of a pair of glasses available right there at the campsite, usually under a treat
But they get glasses in the frames of the choice and that's very important because I think glasses in addition to helping people see is also fashion statement and they're willing to pay for it
So they get it within about 20 minutes And then those who require surgery are counseled, and there are buses waiting, which would transport them to the base hospital
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, my people like this would probably never get services
And certainly not when they most needed
They receive surgery the following day
And then they would stay for a day or two
And then they were put back in the buses to be taken back to where they came from and where their families were debating to take them back home
Yeah
And this happens several thousand times each year
It may sound very impressive that there were seeing lots of patients, very efficient process, But we looked at how we're solving the problem
We did a study, a scientifically designed process, and then to our dismay, we found this was only reaching 7% of those in need, and we're not adequately addressing more bigger problems
So we had to do something different
So we set up what we call as primary ICS-centres, vision centers, these are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on
The received comprehensive I exam, we kind of changed a simple digital camera into a retinal camera and an every patient gets a teleconciltation with a doctor
The effect of this has been that within the first year we really had a 40% penetration in the market that it served, which is about 50,000 people and the second is bent up to 75%
So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it
And in this process of using technology made sure that most don't need to come to the base of Spurut
And how much will they pay for this? We fixed a pricing taking into account what they would save and bus fare in coming to a city
So they pay about 20 rupees and that's good for three consultations
The other challenge was how do you give a high-tech or more advanced treatment and here we designed a one with a V-sat which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed and then as the patient is waiting the report goes back to the patient
It gets printed out the patient gets it and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing, I mean go see a doctor or come back after six months and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market because we focused on the non-customer and then by reaching the Andrihra able to significantly grow the market
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently? Now, when you have very few of the molecules, so what is seen this video is a surgeon operating and then you see the other side, another patient is getting ready
So as the finish is surgery, they just swing the microscope over, the table is replaced so that the distance is just right and then we need to do this because by doing this kind of process, we are able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon
And then to support the surgeon, we required a certain workforce
And then we focused on village girls that they recruited
And then they really are the backbone of the organization
When they do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks, they do one thing at a time, they do it extremely well
With the result, we have very high productivity, very high quality, very, very low cost
So putting all these together, what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else
This is a very busy table, but what this really conveying is that when it comes to quality we are putting a very good quality assurance systems as the result of our complications as significantly lower than what is reported in the United Kingdom
And you don't see those numbers often
Yeah
Yeah
So the final part of the puzzle is how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it? So what we did was we gave a lot of it for free
And then those who pay, I mean they paid local market rates, nothing more, and often much less, and we were helped by the market inefficiency
I think that's been a big savior even now
And of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have a surplus
The result has been, was the years, the expenditure increase with volumes
The revenues increased at a higher level, giving a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free
I think in absolute terms, last year we earned about 20 or $1 million, spent about 13 million with about a 40% EBITDA
Thank you
Thank you
But this really requires going beyond what we do or what we have done
If you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness, and what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things
We created competition for assets, and then we made IKera foldable by making a low cost consumables
We proactively and systematically promote the best practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well
The impact of this has been that these hospitals in the second year after our consultation doubled their output and then achieve a financial recovery as well
The other part was how do you address this increasing cost of technology
So there was a time when we failed to negotiate the prices to be at affordable levels
So we set up a manufacturing unit and then over time we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about 2% of what it used to be when you started out
Today we believe we have about 7% of the global market and there are use number 120 odd countries
To conclude, I mean what we do to sort of a broader relevance, you know, or suggest India or developing countries
So to address this, we study the UK versus 11
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60% of the volume of what UK does
Due to hospital insurgents as a whole country and we do about 300,000
And then we train about 50 of the mortgages against the 70 train by them, comparable quality both in training and in a patient care
So we're really comparing apples to apples
We looked at costs
So I think it is simple to say just because you can India the difference is happening
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well
Maybe there is the solution to the cost could be in productivity, maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process, or in how much they face for the lenses or consumables, regulations, the defensive practice
So I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries, including the U
S
, and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again
Another insight which I want to again leave with you, in conditions where the problem is very large, which cuts across all economic strata where we have a good solution
I think the process that I described, no productivity, quality, patience and career can give an answer
And there are many which fit this paradigm
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on
There are many where this paradigm can apply
But I think probably one of the more challenging things is on the soft side
And how do you create compassion? And how do you make people want the problem, want to do something about it, they have a little bit harder issues
And I am sure people in this crowd can probably find the solution to this
So I want to end my talk living this thought in the challenge to you
When you grow in spiritual consciousness, we are into ourselves with all that is involved
So there is no exploitation
It is ourselves here helping
It is ourselves, we are here
Thank you very much
Thank you
I'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation
They thought largest organized crime, a $10 billion industry, and talking to you about a modern day slavery
Let's you tell you the story of these three children, Tranita, Shaheen, and Angeli
Tranita's mother was a woman in prostitution, a prostitute at birth
She got infected with HIV, and towards the end of her life, when she was in the final stages of AIDS, she could not prostitute
So, she sold four-year-old Pranita to a broker
By the time we got the information, we reached there
Pranita was already raped by three men
Shaheen's background, I don't even know
We found her in a railway track
Rip by many many men, I don't know how many, but the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body
And when we took her to the hospital, she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body
We still don't know who her parents are, who she is, all that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally
Anjali's father, a drunkard, sold his child for pornography
You're seeing here images of three years, four-year-olds and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation
In this country and across the globe, hundreds and thousands of children As young as three, as young as four, are sold into sexual slavery
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for
They sold in the name of adoption, they sold in the name of organ trade, they sold in the name of forced labor, camel jockeying, anything everything
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation and I tell you stories from there
My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager
I was 15 when I was gang raped by eight men
I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it
Yes, they were eight men who defiled me, raped me, But that didn't go into my conscious
I never felt like a victim then or now
But what lingered from then to now I am 40 today is this huge outrageous anger
Two years I was ostracized
I was stigmatized
I was isolated because I was a victim
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors
We as a civil society, we have pH-d's in victimizing a victim
Right from the age of 15, when I started looking around me, I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women in children who are left in sexual slavery like practices, but have absolutely no despite, Because we don't allow them to come in
Where does their journey begin? Most of them come from very optional families
Not just poor
You have even the middle class sometimes getting traffic
I had this IS officer's daughter, who's 14 years old, studying in a nice standard, who was web chatting with one individual
And ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine who was traffic
I have hundreds of thousands of stories of very, very well-to-do family and children from well-to-do families who are getting traffic
These people are deceived, forced, 99
9% of them resist being inducted into prostitution
So, if you are not a man, you are not a man
So, if you are not a man, you are not a man
So, if you are not a man, you are not a man
So, if you are not a man, you are not a man
So, if you are not a man, you are not a man
So, if you are not a man, you are not a man
These are men who buy you for a novel for a day use you throw you
Each of the girls that I have rescued, I have rescued more than 3,200 girls
Each of them tell me one story in common
One story about one man, at least putting chili powder in her vagina
One man taking a cigarette and burning her
One man whipping her
We are living among those men, there are brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins, all around us, and we are silent about them
We think it is easy money
We think it is shock cut
We think the person likes to do what she is doing
But the extra bonuses that she gets is the various infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonoria, you name it, substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun
And one day she gives up on you and me because we have no options for her
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation
She believes, yes, this is it
This is what my destiny is about
And this is normal to get raped by 100 men a day
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter
It's abnormal to get rehabilitated
It's in that context that I work
It's in that context that I rescue children
have rescued children as young as three years and have rescued women as old as 40 years
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had was, where do I begin? Because I had lots of them who are already HIV-infected
One third of the people I rescue are HIV-positive
And therefore, my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from the Spain
And for me, I was my greatest experience, understanding my own self, understanding my own pain, my own isolation, was my greatest teacher
Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential
You see a girl here who's trained as a welder
She works for a very big company, a workshop in Hyderabad, making furnitures
She earns around 12,000 rupees
She's an illiterate girl
Trained skills as a welder
Why welding and why not computers? We felt one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage
They did not have any partners inside their body
He jabs inside themselves
They crossed the barrier of it
And therefore, they could fight in a male-dominated world very easily and not feel very shy about it
We have trained girls as carpenters, as maissons, as security guards, as care-capped drivers, and each one of them are excelling in their chosen field
Gaining confidence, restoring dignity, and building hopes in their own lives
These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ramki construction as maissons, full-time maissons
What has been my challenge? My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up
I've been beated up more than 14 times in my life
I can't hear from my right here
I've lost a staff of mine who has murdered while on a rescue
My biggest challenge is a civil society
It's you and me
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own
A very supportive friend of mine, a well-vision of mine, used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables
When her mother fell sick, she says, you have so much of context, can you get somebody in my house to work so that she can look after my mother and there's a long pause and then she says, not one of our girls
It's very fast-knobled to talk about human trafficking in this fantastic AC Hall
It's very nice for discussion, discourse, making films and everything, but it is not nice to bring them to her homes
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories or companies
It's not nice for a children to study with their children
They're intense
That's my biggest challenge
If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunita Christian, I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking
They need your compassion
They need your empathy
They need much more than anything else, your acceptance
Many times when I talk to people, I keep telling them one thing, don't tell me, hundred ways, how you cannot respond to this problem
Can you apply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem? And that's what I'm here for asking for your support, demanding for your support, requesting for your support
Can you break your culture of silence? Can you speak to these two persons about this story? Tell them the story
Can win them to tell the story to another two persons? I'm not asking you all to become a hot magandis or Martin Luther things or made up art girls or something like that
I'm asking you in your limited world
Can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts
Can you just encompass these people too? Because they're also a part of us
They're also part of this world
I'm asking you for these children whose faces you see, they're no more
They died of AIDS last year
I'm asking you to help them accept as human beings, not as philanthropy, not as charity, but as human beings who deserve all our support
I am asking you this because no child, no human being deserves what these children have gone through
Thank you
Thank you
For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert
So first, this small housekeeping announcement, please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain
So welcome to the Golden Desert Indian Desert
It receives the least rainfall in the country
Loest rainfall if you are well versed with inches, nine inches, centimeters, 16 inches
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters
And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking
So you can't install hand pumps or two wells, though there is no electricity in most of the villages, but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps, they are of no use in this area
So welcome to the Golden Desert
Clouds seldom visit this area, but we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect, used here
There are number of techniques to harvest rain
This is a new word, it's a new program
But for the Desert Society, this is no program, this is their life
And they harvest rain in many ways
So this is the first device they use in harvesting rain
It's called Kun, somewhere it is called Taka
And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment
The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field and this is all big raised platform
You can notice a small hole, the water will fall on this catchment and there is a slope
Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly and the water will go where it should go and then it is 40 feet deep
The water proofing is done perfectly better than our city contractors because not a single drop should go waste in this
They collect 100,000 liters in one season and this is pure drinking water
Below the surface there is hard, saline water, but now you can have this for ear around
It is a two houses
We often use a term called bylaws because we are used to get written things
But here it is unwritten bylaw and people make their house and the water storage tanks
These rays deplaced from just like this stage
In fact, they go 15 feet deep and collect rainwater from roof
This is small pipe and from their courtyard
It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good man's soul
Another big one
This is, of course, out of the hard cold desert area
This is near Jepur
This is called a Jaguar port and it can collect 6 million gallons of rain water in one season
The age is 400 years
So since 400 years it has been giving you almost 6 million gallons of water per season
You can calculate the price of that water
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals
You can see a modern road hardly 50 years old
It can break sometimes, but this 400 year old canal, which draws water, it is maintained for so many generations
Of course, if you want to go inside the two doors are locked, but they can be opened for dead people
And we request them
You can see a person coming up with two connoisseurs of water
And the water level these are not empty canisters, water level is right up to this
It can envy many municipalities
The color, the taste, the purity of this water and this is what they call zero B type of water because it comes from the clouds pure distill water
We stop for a quick commercial break and then we come back to the traditional systems
The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas
That's why I said that this is a commercial break
But we will come back once again to the traditional thing
So water from 300-400 kilometers away soon it became like this
In many portions, water-high-synth covered these big canals like anything
Of course, there are some areas where water is reaching
I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all, but the tail end, the vessel may area, you will notice in Bikaner things like this, where the water-high-synth could grow the sand flowing in these canals
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it
We had full-page advertisements, some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came
They said that, through a way your traditional systems, these new cement tanks will supply you pipe water
It's a dream
And it became a dream also
because soon the water was not able to reach these areas
And people started renovating their own structures
These are all traditional water structures which we won't be able to explain in such a short time
But you can see that no woman is standing on those and they are working here
So we move, Jaisal Mere
This is a heart of this earth
It's a town was established 800 years ago
I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there or Delhi was there or Chinavaz there or Bangalore was there
So this was the terminal point for Silk Route
Well connected 800 years ago through Europe
None of us were able to go to Europe but Jassalmeir was well connected to it and this is the 16 centimeter area such a limited rainfall and highest colorful life flourished in these areas
You won't find water in this slide but it is invisible
where a stream or a riverlet is running through it or if you want to paint you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms
Apart from this system, they design 52 beautiful water bodies around this town and what we call private public partnership
You can add state also
So state public and private and nurse work together to build this beautiful water body
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons
You will admire it just behold beauty throughout the year, whether water level goes up or down the beauty is there throughout
Another water body, right up of course during the summer period, but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics with art
These statues, marvelous statues gives you an idea of water table when this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank, it will submerge these beautiful statues and what we call in English today, mask communication, this was for mask communication
Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drawn, so water will be there for 7 months or 9 months or 12 months and then they will come and worship this pond pay respect they are gratitude
Another small water body called the jaciri, it is difficult to translate in English, especially in my English
Perhaps the nearest will be glory reputation
The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up
and severe drought periods, nobody has seen this water body getting right up
And perhaps the new the future also, it was designed some 150 years ago, but perhaps the new that on 6th November 2009, there will be a dead green and blue session
So they painted it like this
Dry water body, children are not standing on a very difficult device to explain
This is called Queen
We have in English surface water and groundwater, but this is not groundwater
You can draw groundwater from any well, but this is no ordinary well
It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand and they have termed this water as the third one called Rayjani
And there is a Gipsome Belt running below it and it was deposited by the great mother earth, some 3 million years ago
And where we have this Gipsome strip, they can harvest this water
This is the same right water body
Now you do not find any queen
They are all submed, but when the water goes down, they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the air
This year they have received only 6 cm
6 cm of rainfall and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your in your city, Delhi Bombay, Mangalore, Masuore, please come to our area of 6 centimeters
We can give you water
How they maintain them? There are three things concept planning, making the actual thing and also maintaining them
These structures were maintained for centuries by generations without any department, without any funding
So the secret is Shadda, respect your own thing, not personal property, my property every time
So, these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area, don't spit, don't do anything wrong, so that the clean water can be collected
Another pillar is stone pillar on your right side
If you climb these three, six steps you will find something very nice
This was done in 11th century and you have to go further down
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can save a thousand words right now and another thousand words
If the water table goes down you will find new stairs
If it comes up some of them will will be submerged
So throughout the year, this beautiful system will give you some pleasure
Three sites, such steps on four sites, there is a four-story building where you can organize such that conferences anytime
As to who build these structures, they are in front of you
The best civil engineers we had, the best planners, the best architects
We can say that because of them, because of their forefathers, India could get the first engineering college in 1847
But we are knowingly, medium schools at that time, even know Hindi schools, low schools, but such people compelled the East India company, which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business, but not to create engineering colleges, but because of them, first engineering college was created in a small village, not in the town
The last point we all know in our primary schools that camel is a ship of desert
So you can find through your Jeep a camel and a car
This tire comes from the airplane
So look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater and also create something a thrown tire from a get plane and used in a camel car
Last picture it's a tattoo
2000 years old tattoo
They were using it on their body
tattoo was at one time a kind of blacklisted or gone thing but now it is anything
So this is you can copy this tattoo
I have some posters of this
of this
The center of life is water
These are the beautiful waves
These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of these slides
These are the trees and these are the flowers which give which add fragrance to our life
So this is the message of desert
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language
APPLAUSE These artifacts and designs are inspiring
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere that the world can learn from this? Or is this just right for this place? No, the basic idea is to utilize whatever false fun or whatever area
So, the ponds, the open bodies are everywhere right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir and in other parts also and then these staccas which store water and there are two type of things one recharge and one stores
So, it depends on the terrain but ki which uses the Gipsum belt for that you have to go go back to your calendar 3 million years ago
If it is there, it can be done right now, otherwise it can't be done
As an Indian, now as a politician and a government minister, I've become rather concerned about the hype we're hearing about our own country
All this talk about India becoming a world leader, even the next superpower
In fact, the American publishers, my book, The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cellphone, added a gratuitous subtitle saying, India, the next 21st century power
And I just don't think that's what India is all about or should be all about
Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic
It's a redalent of James Bond movies and kipling dullers
After what constitutes a world leader? If it's population, we are on course to top the charts
We will overtake China by 234
Is it military strength? We have the world's fourth largest army
Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that
The Americans have even recognized it in agreement
is that the economy where we have now the fifth largest economy in the world and purchasing power parity terms and we continue to grow and the rest of the world took a beating last year we grew at 6
7%
But somehow, none of that adds up to me to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world in this part of the 21st century
And so one could what the future beckons for India we all about, be a combination of these These things ally to something else
The power of example, the attraction of India's culture
What, in other words, people like to call soft power? Soft power is a concept invented by Harvard academic, Joseph Nights, a friend of mine, and very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here, it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture, its political values, its foreign policies
You know, lots of countries do this
He was writing initially about the states, but we know the early onslaught says, is all about French-South power, the British Council
The Beijing Olympics, where an exercise in Chinese, South power, the Americans have the voice of America, and the full-ride scholarships
But the fact is, in fact, they're probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonald's have done more for American South power around the world than any specifically government activity
So, South power is something that really emerges partly because of governments, but partly despite governments
And in the information here of we all live in today, what we might call the Ted age, and say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on a, and it's just in the diet of internet news, of televised images, of cell phone videos, of email gossip, and other words, all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries, whether or not the countries concerned, wants people to hear those stories
Now, in this age again, countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage
And of course, there are more influence, sometimes about how they're seen
India has more all-new TV channels than any country in the world
In fact, than most of the countries in this part of the world put together
But the fact still is that it's not just there
Someone have to South power
You have to be connected
And when my argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country, I think you've already heard the figures, we've been selling 15 million cell phones a month
Currently, there are 509 million cell phones in Indian hands in India, and that makes us larger than the US as a telephone market
In fact, those 15 million cell phones are the most connections
The any country, including the US and China, have ever established from the history of telecommunications
But what perhaps some of you don't realize is how far we've come to get there
You know, when I grew up in India, telephones were a rare occasion
In fact, there was so rare that elected members of parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy
If you were lucky enough to be a, well, the businessman or an influential journalist or a doctor, something you might have a telephone
But sometimes it just sat there
I went to high school in Calcutta
I mean, we would look at this instrument sitting in the front for you, but half the time we pick it up with an expectant look on our faces, they'd be no dial tone
If there was a dial tone, you dialed a number
The odds were two and three wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach
In fact, the words are wrong number, were more popular than the word hello
If you then wanted to connect to another city, let's say from Calcutta, you wanted to call Delhi, you'd have to book something called a trunk hall and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through
Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call, but lightning struck around the slowly in our country in those days
So, like about half an hour for a lightning call to come through
In fact, so, warful was our telephone service, that a member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this, and that then communications minister replied in a loudly manner, that in a developing country, communications are a luxury not a right, that the government had no obligation to provide better service
And if the honorable member wasn't satisfied with his telephone, could he please return it, since there was an 80-a-long waiting list for telephones in India
They're fast forward to today, and this is what you see, the 15 million cell phones a month
But what's most striking is who's carrying those cell phones? You know, if you visit friends and the suburbs of Delhi on the side streets, you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century
Welling a coal-fired steam island that might have been invented in the 18th century
It's called an Istriwala
But he's carrying a 21st century instrument
He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood to get his to know where to collect clues to get the mind
The other day I was in Kerala, my home state, at the country farm of a friend about 20 kilometers away from any place, you'd consider urban
And it was a hot day, he said, here would you like some fresh coconut water and the best thing, the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics
So I said, and he ripped out a cell phone down the number, and I've always said, I'm up here
And right on top of the nearest coconut tree, where the hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other was the local Totti Tapper
We'll proceed to bring down the coconuts for us to drink
Fishermen are going out to see and carrying their cell phones when they catch the fish, they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices
Farmers now who used to have to spend half a day of back-breaking labor to find out The market town was open if the market was on whether the product they had harvested could be sold what price they'd fetch, they'd often send an eight-year-old boy all the way on the stretch to the market town to get that information and come back, then load the cart, today they're seeing half of these, saving half of these labor with a two-minute phone call
So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected
And that transformation is part of where India is heading today
But of course, it's not the only thing about India that's spreading
You've got Bollywood
My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats that the Bollywood garbage dump
A kick-a-kipol will note out, forgive me
And they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by Bollywood studio
And the first goat chewing away says, you know, this film is not bad
And the second goat says, no other book was better
Are you? I usually tend to think that the book is usually better, but having said that, the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indianness and Indian culture around the globe, not just the Indian diaspora and the US or the UK, but to the screens of Arab's and Africans of Senegalese and Syrians
I have met a young man in New York who's illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes This is a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar just to watch a Bollywood movie
She can't understand the dialogue
She's a litre, so she can't read the French subtitles
But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps
And she has a great time in the song and the dance of the action
She goes away with stars in her eyes about India as a result
And this is happening more and more of Afghanistan
We know what a serious security problem of Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world
India doesn't have a military mission there
You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan over the last seven years? One simple fact, you couldn't try to call enough garnered eight thirty in the evening
Why? Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera, Kunkis Aspika Bibhoti, dubbed into Dari was telecast on Tolu TV and it was the most popular television show in Afghanistan
Every Afghan family wanted to watch it
They had to suspend functions at eight thirty
things were reported to be interrupted
So guess could cluster around the TV set and then turn their attention back to the bright and groom
Crime went up at 830
I have read a Reuters dispatch
So this is not Indian propaganda
A British news agency
A harbours and the town of Masari Sharif
Stricted vehicle
Of its windshield wipers, it's hub caps
It's side view mirrors
Any moving part they could find at 830, because the watchman, the busy watching the TV, rather than mining the store
And this crawled on the windshield and a reference to the show's heroine, Tulsi, Zindabad, Long Liftal Si
That's softball
And that is what India is developing through the e-part of Ted
It's over an entertainment industry
The same is true, of course
We don't have time for too many more examples, but it's true of our music, about dance, about art, yoga, Ayurveda, even Indian cuisine
I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants
Since I first went abroad as a student in the mid-70s, and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-sized town in Europe or North America, not finding Indian restaurants
May not be very good one
But today in Britain, for example, Indian restaurants and Britain employ more people than the coal mining, shipbuilding, and iron and steel industries combined
So the empire can strike back
APPLAUSE But with this increasing awareness of India, with the U
N
and the Iran, so on, with tales like Afghanistan comes something vital in the information era
The sense that in today's world, it's not the side of the bigger army that wins, it's the country that tells a better story that prevails
An India is and must remain in my view the land of the better story
Are you types of changing? I mean, again, having gone to the US as a student of the mid-70s, I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all
Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology, but the same reverence they used to record to MIT
This can sometimes have unintended consequences
I came in
I had a friend, a history major like me
I was a cost-edit, skip all airport and Amsterdam
But actually, perspiring your appearance, Your Indian, your Indian can help me fix my laptop
We've gone from the image of India's land of Phukis lying on beds of nails and snake charmers of the Indian rubric to the image of India's land of mathematical geniuses, computer wizards, software gurus
But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world
But there's something more substantive to that
the story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism
It's a civilizational story to begin with, because India has been an open society for millennia, India gave refuge to the Jews fleeing the first temple of the destruction of the first temple, by the Babylonians and said they're after by the Romans
In fact, legend has it that when doubting Thomas' their puzzles in Thomas, landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state somewhere on 52 AD, he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing Jewish girl
And to this day, it remains the only Jewish diaspora and the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered a single incident of anti-Semitism
That's the Indian story
Islam came peacefully to the south, slightly more differently complicated history in the north
But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India
We just celebrated this year, our general elections, the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history
And the next one will be even bigger because voting population keeps growing by 20 million a year
But the fact is that the last elections five years ago gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, So Nergane, who then made way for a Sikh man Mohan Singh to be sworn in his prime minister by a Muslim president Abdul Kalam in a country 81% Hindu
And this
APPLAUSE This is India and of course it's all the most striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the US, the oldest democracy in the modern world more than 220 years of free and fair elections, which took to last year to elect a president, or vice president who was in fight for mail or Christian
So maybe, I start here in Christian, I think you're part and he is male, but he isn't white
All the others have been all those three
All his predecessors have been all those three, and that's the point I was trying to make
But the issue is that when I talked about that example, It's not just about talking about India
It's not propaganda because ultimately, that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world
It was essentially India being itself
And ultimately it seems to me that always works better than propaganda
Governments are very good at telling stories
But people see a society for what it is
And that it seems to me is what ultimately will make a difference in today's information era and today's Ted Age
So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion, because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically with every religion known to mankind, with the possible exception of shintoism, that has some Hindu elements somewhere
We have 23 official languages in our recognized and our constitution, and those of you who catch their money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the repeat note spelling of the denominations
We've got all of that
We don't even have geography uniting, that's because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in 1947
In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted, because the name India comes from the river Indus, which flows in Pakistan
But the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea
It's an idea of an ever-evilant
Emerging from an ancient civilization, United by a shared history, but sustained the bubble by pluralist democracy
That is a 21st century story as well as an ancient one
And it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste, greed, color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant for that matter, and still rally around the consensus
And the consensus is on a very simple principle that in a diverse, plural democracy like India, you don't really have to agree on everything all the time
So long as you agree on the ground rules, of how you will disagree
The great success story of India, country that so many learned scholars and gentlers assume would disintegrate in the 50s and 60s, is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus
That that is India that is emerging into the 21st century
I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India, it isn't military muscle, economic power, all of that's necessary
But we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome
Somebody said, you know, we are super poor and we're also super power
We can't really be both of those
We have to overcome our poverty
We have to deal with the hardware of development, the ports, the roads, the airports, all the infrastructural things we need to do, and the software of development
The human capital
the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day, to be able to send his or her children to a decent school and to aspire to work a job that will give them
Opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves, but it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges, those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist, but it's all taking place in an open society, in a rich and diverse and plural civilization in one that has determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people
That's why India belongs a tad, and that's why tad belongs in India
Thank you very much
Thank you
To understand the business of mythology and what a chief belief officer is supposed to do, you have to hear a story of Ganesha, the elephant headed God who is the scribe of story tellers and his brother, the athletic wall-out of the gods, Kartike, the two brothers, one One day, decided to go on a race
Three times around the world
Kartikell leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans
He went around once
He went around twice
He went around twice
But his brother, Ganesha, simply walked around his parents once twice twice
And said, I won
How come, said Karthikaya? And Ganesha said, you went around the world
I went around my world
What matters more? If you understand the difference between the world and my world, you understand the difference between logos and mythos
The world is objective, logical, universal, factual, scientific
My world is subjective, it's emotional, it's personal, it's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams, it is the belief system that we carry, it's the myth that we live in
The world tells us how the world functions, how the sun rises, how we are born, my world tells us why the sun rises, why were we born? Every culture is trying to understand itself
Why do we exist? And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life
its own customized version of mythology
Culture is a reaction to nature, and this understanding of our ancestors and transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories, symbols and rituals, which are always indifferent to rationality
And so when you study it, you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world
Different people see things differently, different viewpoints
There is my world and there is your world
And my world is always better than your world
Because my world you see is rational and yours is superstition
Yours is faith
Yours is illogical
This is the root of the clash of civilizations
It took place once in 326 BC on the banks of a river called the Indus
Now in Pakistan, this river lends itself to India's name, India, India's
Alexander, a young Macedonian met there what he called a gymno-sophist, which means the naked wise man
We don't know who he was, perhaps he was a giant monk
Bahubali over here, the Ghammatati Shara Bahubali, who's images not far from my soul
Or perhaps he was just a yogi, who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky and the sun and the moon
I'll examine asked, what are you doing? And the gymnast of his childhood, I'm experiencing nothingness
Then the gymnast of his past, what are you doing? And Alexander said, I am conquering the world
And they both laughed
Each one thought that there was a fool
Jim Nose of his said, why is he conquering the world? It's pointless
And Alexander thought, why is he sitting around doing nothing? What a waste of a life
To understand this difference in viewpoints, we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander, his myth and the mythology with constructed it
Alexander's mother, his parents, the teacher, Aristotle told him the story of Homer's illiada
They told him of a great heroical Achilles, who went participated in battle, victory was a shod, but when he withdrew from the battle, defeat was inevitable
Achilles was a man who could shape history, a man of destiny, and this is what you should be Alexander
That's what he heard
What should you not be? You should not be Sisyphus, who rolls a rock up the mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night
Don't live a life which is monotonous, mediocre, meaningless
Be spectacular, like the Greek heroes, like Jason, who went across the sea with the agonauts and fetched the golden fleece
Be spectacular, like Thesis, who entered the labyrinth and killed the bullheaded men at all
When you play in a race, win, because when you win, the acceleration of victory is the It closes you will come to the ambrosia of the gods
Because you see the Greeks believed you live only once and when you die you have to cross the river steaks and if you have lived an extraordinary life you will be welcomed to elisium or what the French call Shalza Lise
The heaven of the heroes
But these are not the stories that the gymnosofist heard
He heard a very different story
He heard of a man called Bharat, after whom India is called Bharat
Bharat also conquered the world
And then he went to the topmost peak of the greatest mountain in the center of the world called Meiru
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say, I was here first
But when he reached the mountain peak, he found the peak covered with countless flags of world conquerors before him
Each one claiming I was here first, that's what I thought until I came here
And suddenly in this canvas of infinity, Bharat felt insignificant
This was the mythology of the gymnast of his
You see, he had heroes like Ram, Raghu Bhatiram, and Krishna go in the hurry, But they were not two characters on two different adventures
They were two lifetimes of the same hero
When Ramayana ends, the Mahabharat begins
When Ram dies, Krishna is born, when Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram
You see, the Indians also had a river with separates the land of the living from the land of the dead
But you don't cross it once
You go to and fro endlessly
It was called the Vaitharini
You go again and again and again because you see nothing lasts forever in India, not even death
And so you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for 10 days and what do you do at the end of 10 days? You dunk it in the river
Because it has to end and next year she will come back
What goes around, always comes around, and this rule applies not just to man, but also the gods
You see the gods have to come back again and again and again as Rama is Krishna
Not only do they live in finite lives, but the same life is lived in finite times to you get the point of it all
Groundhogs today
Two different mythologies, which is right
Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world
One linear, one cyclical, one believes this is the one and only life
The other believes this is one of many lives
And so the denominator of Alexander's life was one
So the value of his life was the sum total of achievements, the denominator of the Jim Nozhoff's life was infinity
So no matter what he did, it was always zero
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero
Who knows? And that brings us to the mythology of business
If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior, if the gymnast of his belief influences behavior, then it was bound to influence the business they were in
You see, what is business? But the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves
And if you look at cultures around the world, all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business, take a look
If you live only once in one life culture around the world, you will see an obsession with binary logic
Absolute truth, standardization, absoluteness, linear patterns and design
But if you look at cultures which are cyclical and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic
With opinion, with contextual thinking, with everything is relative, sort of, mostly
You look at art, look at the ballerina, how linear she is in a performance and didn't look at the Indian classical dancer, look at the chupati dancer, the Bharat Natham dancer, curvacious
And then look at business, standard business model, vision, mission, values, processes, sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land, with the commandments held by the leader and if you comply you will go to heaven
But in India there is no dirt promised land, there are many promised lands, depending on your station and society, depending on your stage of life
You see businesses are not run as institutions, but the idiosyncrasies of individuals
is always about taste
It's always about my taste
You see, Indian music, for example, does not have the concept of harmony
There is no orchestra conductor
There is one performer standing there and everybody follows
And you can never replicate their performance twice
It is not about documentation and contract
It's about conversation and faith
It's not about compliance, it's about setting, getting the job done by bending or breaking the rules
Just look at your Indian people around here, you'll see them smile, they know what it is
And then look at people of done business in India, you'll see the exasperation on their faces
You see, this is what India is today, the ground reality is based on a cyclical world view, with rapidly changing, highly diverse, chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable people are okay with it
And then globalization is taking place
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in which is rooted in one life culture
And clash is going to take place like on the banks of the Indus
It is bound to happen
I have personally experienced it
I'm trained as a medical doctor
I did not want to study surgery
Don't ask me why
I loved mythology too much
I want to learn mythology, but there's nowhere you can study
So I have to teach it myself
And mythology does not pay and belong to now
LAUGHTER So I take up a job
And I worked in the farm-industry
And I worked in the health care industry
And I worked as a marketing guy, a sales guy, and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy
I even was a business consultant to be in strategies and tactics
And I would see the exasperation between American and European colleagues when they were dealing with India
Example, please tell us the process to invoice hospitals
Step A, step B, step C, mostly
How do you parameterize mostly? How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't
I would give my viewpoints to people, but nobody was interested in listening to it
You see, until I met Kishorebe, I knew of the future group
You see, he has established the largest retail chain called Big Bazaar, and there are more than 200 formats across 50 cities and towns of India
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets
And he knew very intuitively that best practices developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India
He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India, individual thinking, yet an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India
So he asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer and said, all I want you to is a line belief
Sounds so simple, but belief is not measurable
You can't measure it, you can't manage it
So how do you construct belief? How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indianness? Even if you're Indian, it is not very explicit
It's not very obvious
So I try to work on the standard model of culture, which is develop story symbols in which will then I will share one of the rituals with you
You see, it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan
Hindus don't have the concept of commandments
So there's nothing right or wrong in what you do in life
So you're not really sure how you stand in front of God
So when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God
You want to see God
And you want God to see you, and hence, The gods have very large eyes, large, unblinking eyes, sometimes made of silver, so they look at you
Because you don't know what they write along, and so all you seek is divine empathy
Just know where I came from, why I did the jugard
Why did I do this setting? Why don't care for the process? Just understand me
Please
And based on this we created a ritual for leaders, After the leader completes his training and is about to take over the store, we blindfold him
We surround him with his stakeholders
The customer, his family, his team, his boss
You read out his KRA KPI, you give him the keys and then you remove the blindfold
And invariably, you see a tear because a penny has dropped
He realizes that to succeed, he does not have to be a professional
He does not have to cut out his emotions
He has to include all these people in his world to succeed, to make them happy, to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy, the customers happy, the customer is God
That sensitivity is what we need
Once this belief enters, behavior will happen, business will happen, and it has
So then we come back to Alexander and to the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast of the gymnast ending on the outcome, shoes your paradigm
You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions, their cultural creations, not natural phenomena
And so the next time you need someone, a stranger, one request, understand that you live in the subjective truth, and so does he, understand it
And when you understand it, you will discover something spectacular
He will discover that with an infinite myth slice the eternal truth, who sees it all? Varunah has but a thousand eyes, Indra 100, you and I, only two, thank you
Dao Shka
Thank you
So a few years ago my eyes were open to the dark side of the construction industry
In 2006, young Atari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps
I, since then, followed the unfolding issue of worker rights
In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or cancelled
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentioned construction worker
1
1 million of them
Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lanka, and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home
They pay a middleman thousands of dollars to be there
And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water, no air conditioning, and their passports taken away
While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities, 99% of these people are hired by the private sector
And so therefore, we're equally of not more accountable
Groups like Build Safe UAE have emerged, but the numbers are simply overwhelming
In August 2008, UAA public officials noted that 40% of the country's 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations
And last summer, more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages, for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing, and then the financial collapse happened
When the contractors have gone bust as they've been overleverage like everyone else, the difference is everything goes missing
Documentation, passports, and tickets home for these workers
Currently right now, thousands of workers are abandoned
There's no way back home, and there's no way a no proof of arrival
other boom and bust refugees
The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sites every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations? So let's forget your environmental footprint
Let's think about your ethical footprints
What good is it to build a zero carbon energy efficient complex when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best
Now recently I've been told I've been taking the high road but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
So let's not forget who's really paying the prices is financial collapse and that as we worry about our next job in the office you know the next the next design that we can get to keep our workers
Let's not forget these men who are truly dying to work
Thank you
I'm Dr
David Hansen and I build robots with the character
By that I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you
We're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech, and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are and build a relationship with you
I developed a series of technologies that allow robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power which enabled walking by-ped robots, the first Android
So it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on very small batteries, extremely lightweight
The materials that allowed the battery operated facial expressions is a material that we call fruber and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allowed us to happen
One is hierarchical pores and the other is a macro molecular nanoscale porosity in the material
They're starting to walk
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology
I built the head, they built the body
So the goal here is to achieve sentience and machines and not just sentience but empathy
We're working with the machine perception laboratory at the UC San Diego
They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're making, and also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation, we're emulating all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call the character engine
And here's a little bit of the technology that's involved in that
In fact, when I plug it from here, I'm gonna plug it in here
And now let's see if it gets my facial expressions
Okay, so I'm smiling
And now I'm frowning
And this is really heavily backlit
Okay, there we go
So sad, say smile, smile and so his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic
Machines are becoming a devastatingly capable of things like killing, right? Those machines have no place for empathy and there's billions of dollars being spent on that
Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy
of the chief human level intelligence or quite possibly greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future
So we've made 20 robots in the last eight years during the course of getting my PhD, and then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing
This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired Next Fest a couple of years ago, and it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person remembering people
So we're involving two things
One, the perception of people and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot
You start to believe that it's alive and aware
So one of my favorite projects was bringing all the stuff together in an artistic display of an Android portrait of science fiction writer, Fibil K
Dick, who wrote great works like during the DREAM of Electric Sheep, which was the basis of the movie Blade Runner
And these stories robots often think that they are human, and they sort of come to life
So we put his writings letters, his interviews, correspondence into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then use some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with them
And it was kind of spooky because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you
This is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence
And we're getting this mass-meaned factored
We've decked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low cost bill of materials so that it can become a childhood companion for kids, interfacing with the internet
It gets smarter over the years as artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence
Thank you so much, Sussian
Thank you
Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis
Arguably, the financial markets have failed
Us and the aid system is failing us
And yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there's probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive
Because of some of the technologies we've been talking about, because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world
the mindset to create change
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room, must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen
You work on the front lines, and you've seen the best in the worst that human beings can do for one another, and two one another
And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things individuals are capable of, even in the most ordinaryness
Today, there's a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies
On the one hand, we have people that say, the aid system is so broken, we need to throw it out
And on the other, we have people who say, the problem is we need more aid
And what I want to talk about is something that's compliments both systems
We call it patient capital
The critics point to the $500 billion spent in Africa since 1970, and say, and what do we have, but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty rampant corruption they use Mavuto as metaphor
And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest
don't give anything away
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problems that we need more money, that when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid
But when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it
They point to the successes of aid
The eradication of smallpox and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bednets and anti-retrovirals, both sides or right
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other
Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves
After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market oriented individuals on the planet than low income people
They must navigate markets daily, making micro decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society
And yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations
And so we need both the market and we need aid
Patient capital works between and tries to take the best of both
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to health care, water, housing, alternative energy
Thinking of low-income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have
And the expectation of below market returns, but outside social impacts
It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people
Now entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons
First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day, and they're making all of their decisions within that income level
Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure, no roads to speak of sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption
And third, they are often creating markets, even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages
It is something new
And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offer to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance, not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those businesses to other markets, to governments, to corporations, real partnerships if we want to get to scale
I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation
In 2002, I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sedangi from India, who who had been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day
They were creating subsidies either for large farms or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use rather than that the farmers wanted to use
At the same time, Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stock of the plant
And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers
Because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large
The average small hole to farmer works on two acres or less
And so on, I'm a time I decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves because he had spent so many years listening to what they needed, not what he thought that they should have
And he used three fundamental principles
The first one was miniaturization
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two because it was two frightening given all that he had at stake
Second, it had to be extremely affordable
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk
And third, it had to be what Amitabal calls infinitely expandable
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and the third and a fourth
As of today, IDE India, Amitabal's organization has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems, and is seeing their yields and incomes double or triple on average
But this didn't happen overnight
In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet
And that we're working on the riskiest sectors agriculture
And so we needed grants and a use significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate, and try again
And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in
And we helped him build a company for a profit that would build on IDE's knowledge and start looking at sales and exports and be able to tap into other kinds of capital
Secondly, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries
And so we met Dr
Sonno Cangadani in Pakistan
And while again, you needed patients to move a technology for the poor in India, into Pakistan, just to get the permits
Over time, we were able to start a company with Dr
Sonno who runs a large community development organization in the tar desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country
And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too will see the impact on millions
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation
We're starting to see these happening all around the world
In Arusha Tanzania, Aida's said, Texton Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, which is great a factory that now employ 7,000 people mostly women, and they produce 20 million life-saving for Africans around the world
Life-spring hospital is a joint venture between acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable and maternal health care to low-income women
And it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days
And one-two-nine ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access and a severe and public decision, not to engage in any form of corruption, so that in the terrorist attacks of November, they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale because of partnership
They've just won four government contracts to build after 100 ambulances in our one of the largest, and most effective ambulance companies in India
This idea of scale is critical, because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people, all of the ones I discussed, have reached at least a quarter million people, but that's obviously not enough
And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important, whether it's by finding those innovations that can access to the capital markets, government itself, or a partner with major corporations, there's unbelievable opportunity for innovation
President Obama understands that
He recently authorized the creation of a social innovation fund to focus on what works in this country and look at how we can scale it
And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance
And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective, and from a social impact perspective
When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan
We've had a rocky relationship with that country and in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very liable partner
But again, I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, So we would have governments blessing, nor in international experts
But in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country, people like Roshani Zafer, who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country and has a real role model for women inside and outside the country
And Tessanim Sadiky, who developed a way called incremental housing where he's moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing, educational initiatives like Dill and the Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country
It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now and for those of you who've also worked there can attest the Pakistanis are incredibly hard-working population, and there's a fierce upward mobility in their very nature
President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable
I would say that the Congress is true, that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and the extending opportunity to the 70% of Pakistanis who make less than $2 a day provide real pathways to hope
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciously build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world
I'm one of my last visits to Pakistan
I asked Dr
Sonow if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the tar desert
And we left Karachi one morning before Don and it was about 115 degrees
And we drove for eight hours along this moon-skate-like landscape with very little color, lots of heat, very little discussion because we were exhausted
And finally at the end of the journey, I could see the thin little yellow line across the horizon
And as we got closer, it's significance became apparent that there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall
as one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life
His name was Rajan, and he had kind, twinkly, his lies, and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father
And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two-day journey across the desert to work his day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day because he was building these crops
And with the money he earned, he could stay this year
And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his son
And he said, of course, I will, because I don't want them discriminated against anymore
When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity, because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity because that's where dignity really starts
Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental
and that power without love is reckless and abusive
Our generation has seen both approaches tried and often fail
But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power
For that is what we'll need as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet
The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions across sector is now
I can only talk for my own experience, but in eight years of running active in the time, I've seen the power of patient capital, not only to inspire innovation and risk-taking, but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions and services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet
I know it works, but I know that many other kinds of innovation also work
And so I urge you in whatever sector you work, and whatever job you do, to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help, rather than what we think that they might need
It will take embracing the world with both arms, And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability with a sense of integrity and perseverance
And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations
And there is so much good that we can do, just think of all those sunflowers in the desert
Thank you
Thank you
For me, they normally happen these career crises
Often actually on a Sunday evening
Just as a sun is starting to set and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life start to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillar
I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem
You may think I'm wrong in this, but I think that we live in an age of an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises by moments when what we thought we knew about our lives, about our careers comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality
It's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living
It's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm, to be free of career anxiety
And I want to look now, if I may, as some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers, why we might be victims of these career crises as we're weeping softly into our pillows
One of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobbs
Now, in a way, I've got some bad news, particularly for anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad
There's a real problem with snobbery because sometimes people from outside the UK imagine that snobbery is a distinctively UK phenomenon, fixated on country houses and titles
The bad news is that's not true
Snobbery is a global phenomenon
We are a global organization
It's a global phenomenon
It exists
What is a snob? A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you and accuses that to come to a complete vision of who you are
That is snobbery
And the dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is Job Snobbery
You encounter it within minutes at a party when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early 21st century, what do you do? And according to how you answer that question, people are either incredibly delighted to see or look at their watch and make their excuses
Now, the opposite of a snob is your mother
Not necessarily, not necessarily your mother, or indeed mine, but as it were the ideal mother, somebody who doesn't care about your achievements, but unfortunately most people are not our mothers, most people make strict correlation between how much time and if you like love, not romantic love, though that maybe something, but love in general, respect their willing to record us, that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy
And that's a lot of the reason where we care so much about our careers
And indeed, start caring so much about material goods
You know, we're often told that we live in very materialistic times, that we're all greedy people
I don't think we are particularly materialistic
I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods
It's not the material goods we want, it's the rewards we want
And that's a new way of looking at luxury goods
The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think this is somebody who's greedy
Think this is somebody who's incredibly vulnerable and in need of love
In other words, feel sympathy rather than contempt
There are other reasons
There are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before
One of these, and it's paradoxical because it's linked to something that's rather nice, is the hope we all have for our careers
Never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan
We're told for many sources that anyone can achieve anything
We've done away with the caste system, we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please, and it's a beautiful idea
Along with that, it's come a spirit of equality
We're all basically equal
There are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies
There's one really big problem with this
And that problem is envy
envy is a real taboo to mention envy
But if there's one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy
And it's linked to the spirit of equality
Let me explain
I think it would be very unusual for anyone here, or anyone watching, to be envious of the Queen of England
Even though she's much richer than any of you are, And she's at a very large house
The reason why we don't envy her
The reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird
She's simply too strange
We can't relate to her
She speaks in a funny way
She comes from an odd place
So we can't relate to her
And when you can't relate to somebody, you don't envy them
The closer two people are in age, in background, in the process of identification, the more there's a danger of envy, which is incidentally, why none of you should ever go to a school reunion
Because there is no stronger reference point than people when one was at school with
But the problem generally of modern societies, it turns the whole world into a school
Everybody's wearing jeans, everybody's the same, and yet they're not
So there's a spirit of equality, combined with deep inequalities, which makes for a very can make for a very stressful situation
It's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as Bill Gates
As it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would exceed to the ranks of the French aristocracy
But the point is, it doesn't feel that way
It's made to feel by magazines and other media outlets that if you've got energy, a few bright ideas about technology, a garage, a YouTube could start a major thing
And the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops when you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections, as I sometimes do
If you analyze self-help books that are produced in the world today, there are basically two kinds
The first kind tells you, you can do it
You can make it anything's possible
And the other kinds, Heliou, how to cope with what we They're a polite call, lo-self esteem, or impolitely call, feeling very bad about yourself
There's a real correlation between a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything and the existence of lo-self esteem
So that's another way in which something that's quite positive can have a nasty kickback
There's another reason why we might be feeling more anxious about our careers, about our status in the world today than ever before
And it's again linked to something nice
And that nice thing is called meritocracy
Now everybody, all politicians on left and right agree that meritocracy is a great thing
And we should all be trying to make our societies really, really meritocratic
In other words, what is a meritocratic society? Meritocratic society is one in which if you've got talent and energy and skill, you will get to the top
Nothing should hold you back
It's a beautiful idea
The problem is, if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top get to the top, you'll also buy implication and in a far more nasty way, believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there
In other words, your position in life comes to seem not accidental but merited and deserved and that makes failure seem much more crushing
You know, in the middle ages, in England, when you met a very poor person, that person would be described as an unfortunate
Literally, someone who had not been blessed by fortune and unfortunate
Nowadays, particularly In the United States, if you meet someone at the bottom of society, they may untimely be described as a loser
There's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser
And that shows 400 years of evolution in society and are belief in who is responsible for our lives
It's no longer the God, it's us
We're in the driving seat that's exhilarating if you're doing well
And very crushing if you're not
It leads in the worst cases in the analysis of sociologists like Emil Durkheim
It leads to increased rates of suicide
There are more suicides in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world
And some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally
They own their success, but they also own their failure
Is there any relief from some of these pressures that I've just been outlining? I think there is
I just want to turn to a few of them
Let's take meritocracy
This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to
I think it's a crazy idea
Completely crazy
I will support any politician of left and right with any halfway decent meritocratic idea
I'm a meritocratic, in that sense
But I think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic
It's an impossible dream
The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody's graded
The good at the top and the bad at the bottom and it's exactly done as it should be, is impossible
There are simply too many random factors, accidents, accidents of birth, accidents of things dropping on people's heads, illnesses, etc
We will never get to grade them
Never get to grade people as they should
I'm drawn to a lovely quote by St
Augustine in the city of God where he says, it's a sin to judge any man by his post in modern English
That would mean it's a sin to come to any of you who should talk to depend on their business card
It's not the post that should count
And according to St
Augustine, it's only God who can really put everybody in their place
And he's going to do that on the day of of judgment with angels and trumpets and the skies will open
In say an idea, if you're a secular person like me, but something very valuable in that idea, nevertheless
In other words, hold your horses when you're coming to judge people
You don't necessarily know what someone's true value is
That is an unknown part of them and we shouldn't behave as though it is known
There's another source of solace and comfort for all this
When we think about failing in life, when we think about failure, one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income, a loss of status, what we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others
And it exists, you know, the number one organ of ridicule nowadays is the newspaper
And if you open the newspaper, any day of the week, it's full of people who've messed up their lives
They've slept with a wrong person, they've taken the wrong substance, they've passed the wrong piece of legislation, whatever it is, and they're now fit for ridicule
In other words, they are failed and they are described as losers
Now is there any alternative to this? I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative, and that is tragedy
Traject art, as it developed in the theatres of ancient Greece in the 5th century BC, was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail
And also, according to them, a level of sympathy, which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them
I remember a few years ago, I was thinking about all this, and I went to see the Sunday Sport, a tabloid newspaper that I don't recommend you to start reading, if you're not familiar with it already
And I went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of Western art
And I wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon
So I told them about a fellow, they had not heard of it, but they were fascinated by it
And they, I asked them to write the headline for the story of a fellow
They came up with love crazed immigrant, kill senators, daughter, splash-brasser, I gave them that the plot line of Madame Beauvary
again, and book they wouldn't charm to discover
And they wrote, shopaholic adulterous swallows arsenic after credit fraud
And then my favorite, and they really do have a kind of genius all of their own
These guys, my favorite, Sophocles is Eadipus the King
Sex with mum was blinding
Um, it's, anyway, but, in a way, if you like one end of the spectrum of sympathy, you've got the tabloid newspaper, the other end of the spectrum, you've got tragedy and tragic art
And I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit by about what's happening in tragic art
It would be insane to call Hamlet Alusa
He is not Alusa, though he has lost
And I think that is the message of tragedy to us and why it's a very, very important, I think
The other thing about modern society and why it causes anxiety is that we have nothing at its center that is nonhuman
We are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves
We think very highly of ourselves, and so we should, we put people on the moon, we don't all sorts of extraordinary things, and so we tend to worship ourselves
Our heroes, our human heroes
That's a very new situation
Most other societies have had a right at their center, the worship of something transcendent, a God, a spirit, a natural force, the universe, whatever it is, something else that is being worshiped
We've started lost a habit of doing that, which is I think why we particularly drawn to nature, not for the sake of our health, though it's often presented that way, But because it's in a scape from the human ant hill, it's in a scape from our own competition and our own dramas
And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers, and oceans, and contemplating the earth from outside its perimeter, et cetera
We like to feel in contact with something that is nonhuman and that is so deeply important to us
What I think I've been talking about really is success and failure
And one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means
If I said to you that there's somebody behind the screen who's very, very successful, a certain ideas would immediately come to mind
You would think that person might have made a lot of money, achieved renown in some field, my own theory of success, and I'm somebody who's very interested in success
I really want to be successful
I'm always thinking, how can I be more successful? But as I get older, I'm also very nuanced about what that word success might mean
Here's an insight that I've had about success
You can't be successful at everything
We hear a lot about talk about work, life balance, nonsense
You can't have it all, you can't
So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on, where the element of losses
And I think any wise life will accept, as I say, that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding
And the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own
They're sucked in from other people
Cheathly, if you're a man, you're father, and if you're a woman, you're mother, psychoanalysis has been drumming home message for about 80 years, no one's quite listening hard enough, but I very much believe that that's true
And we also suck in messages from everything from the television, advertising to marketing, et cetera
These are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves
When we're told banking is a very respectable profession, a lot of us want to go into banking
When banking is no longer respectable, we lose interest in banking
we are highly open to suggestion
So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success, but we should make sure that they are our own
We should focus in on our ideas and make sure that we own them, that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions, because it's bad enough not getting what you want, but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want and find out at the end of the journey that it isn't in fact what you wanted all along
So I'm going to end it there, but what I really want to stress is, by all means, success, yes
But let's accept the strangeness of some ideas
Let's probe away at our notions of success
Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own
Thank you very much
That was fascinating, but how do you reconcile the idea of someone being bad, think of someone as a loser with the idea that a lot of people like of, you know, seizing control of your life and the society that encourages that, perhaps has to have some winners and losers
Yes, I think it's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that I want to stress because the emphasis now it is so much is on the justice of everything
And politicians always talk about justice
Now I'm a firm believer in justice
I just think that it's impossible
So we should do everything we can
We should do everything we can to pursue it, But at the end of the day, we should always remember that whoever is facing us, whatever has happened in their lives, there will be a strong element of the haphazard
And it's that that I'm trying to leave room for, because otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic
I mean, do you believe that you can combine your kind of kindle, agenda, la philosophy of work with a successful economy, or do you think that you can't, but it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that? The nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them
And that somehow the cruel and the environment, the more people will rise to the challenge
You want to think, who would you like as your ideal dad? And your ideal dad is somebody who's tough but gentle
And it's a very hard line to make
We need fathers as it were the exemplary father figures in society, avoiding the two extremes, which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand
And on the other, the lacks no rules option

This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School
Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects and be trusted
Trested not to hurt themselves and trusted not to hurt others
Tinkering school doesn't follow a set curriculum and there are no tests
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing
When the kids arrive, they're confronted with lots of stuff, wood and nails and rope and wheels, and lots of tools, real tools
It's a six day immersive experience for the kids
And within that context, we can offer the kids time, something that seems in short supply and they're over scheduled lives
Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived and the deep internal realization that you configure things out by fooling around
Nothing ever turns out as planned, ever
And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry
And become a tease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success or gleeful calamity
We start from doodles and sketches, and sometimes we make real plans, and sometimes we just start building
Building is at the heart of the experience
Hands on deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand
Robin and I acting as collaborators keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion
This process is in the doing and failures are celebrated and analyzed
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear
When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities of really interesting behavior emerges, decoration
The generation of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation
From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before
All materials are available for use, even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined
And the things that they build amazed even themselves
Three, two, one, go! A roller coaster built by seven year olds
Thank you
It's been a great pleasure
Well, if President Obama invited me to be the next Tsar of Mathematics, then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country, and it would be easy to implement and inexpensive
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra, Everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject
And at the top of that pyramid, it's calculus
And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid
That the correct summit that all of our students every high school graduate should know should be statistics, probability and statistics
I mean, don't get me wrong
Calculus is an important subject
It's one of the great products of the human mind
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics, they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way in their day-to-day lives
On the other hand, statistics, that's a subject that you could and should use on a daily basis
It's risk, it's reward, it's randomness, it's understanding data
I think if our students, if our high school students, if all of the American citizens knew about probability and statistics, we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today
Not only, thank you, not only that, if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun
I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling
It's analyzing trends, it's predicting the future
Look, the world has changed from analog to digital
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital, to them from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern discrete mathematics, the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data, in that being probability and statistics
In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means and I needed
Thank you very much
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world
I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation
I'll start here
Last November, there was a presidential election
You probably read something about it in the papers
There was some concern that in some parts of the country, there might be voter suppression
So a plan came up to video the vote
And the idea was that individual citizens with phones, capable of taking photos, making video would document their polling places on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques and would upload this to a central place
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation
That citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes, but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall
Right? pattern that assumes we're all in this together
What matters here isn't technical capital
It's social capital
These tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring
It isn't when the shiny new tools show up that they're used to start permeating society
It's when everybody is able to take them for granted
Because now that media is increasingly social, Innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together
And so we're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere and moving from one spot to another
That is a huge transformation
Not to put too fine a point on it
The moment we're living through, the moment our historical generation is living through
is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history
And that's a big claim I'm going to try and back it up
There are only four periods in the last 500 years, where media has changed enough to qualify for the label Revolution
The first one is the famous one, the printing press
Moveable type oil based inks that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned Europe upside down starting in the middle of the 1400
Then a couple of hundred years ago, There was innovation in two-way communication, conversational media, first the telegraph, then the telephone, slow text-based conversations, then real-time voice-based conversations
Then about 150 years ago, there was revolution-recorded media other than print, first photos, then recorded sound, then movies, all encoded into physical objects
And finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of the electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the radio television
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century
This is what those of us of a certain age grew up with and are used to
But there's a curious asymmetry here
The media that's good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups and the media that's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations
If you want to have a conversation in this world you have it with one other person
If you want to address a group you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group, whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press
That was the media landscape as we had in the 20th century
And this is what changed
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a wind screen as Bill Cheswick's map of the internet
He traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them
The internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time
where's the phone gave us the one to one pattern and television radio, magazines, books gave us the one to many pattern
The internet gives us the many to many pattern
For the first time, media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations
That's one of the big changes
The second big change, right? Is that as all media gets digitized, the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media, meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet, magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet
And that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium
Put another way
Media is increasingly less just a source of information, as increasingly more a site of coordination
Because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well
And the third big change is that members the former audiences Dan Gilmour call them, can now also be producers and not consumers
Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape, a new producer joins as well because the same equipment, phones, computers, let's you consume and produce
It's as if when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free
It's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons
That is a huge change
the media landscape we're used to and it's not just internet or no internet
We've had the internet in its public form for almost 20 years now and it's still changing as the media becomes more social
It's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the internet well
Second story
Last May, China and the Sichuan province had a terrible earthquake, 7
9 magnitude, massive destruction in a wide area as the Richter scale has it
that the earthquake was reported as it was happening
People were texting from their phones, they were taking photos of buildings, they were taking videos of building shaking, they were uploading it to QQ, China's largest internet service, they were twittering it
And so as the quake was happening, the news was reported
And because of the social connections, Chinese students coming elsewhere and going to school or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China
They were people listening all over the world hearing this news
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese Quake from Twitter
Twitter announced the existence of the Quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody with you
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude
It took them three months to admit that it had happened
Now, they might have liked to have done that here rather than seeing these pictures go up online
But they weren't given that choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens rather than from the Shinhua News Agency
And this stuff rippled like wildfire
For a while, the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter, the global short messaging service, Nine of the top 10 links were about the quake
People co-lating information, pointing people to new sources, pointing people to the US Geological Survey
The tenth one was kittens on a treadmill, but that's the internet for you
But nine of the 10 in those first hours, and within half a day, donations sites were up and donations were pouring in from all around the world
This is an incredible, coordinated global response And the Chinese, then in one of their periods of media openness, decided that they were going to let it go, that they were going to let this citizen reporting flower
And then this happened
People began to figure out in the Sichuan province that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed, because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day
The reason so many school buildings collapsed, that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those buildings to be built to less than code
And so they started the citizen journal, started reporting that as well
And there was an incredible picture you may have seen on the front page the New York Times
A local official literally prostrated herself in the street in front of these protesters in order to get them to go away
Essentially to say, we will do anything to play kids
You just please stop protesting in public
But these are people who have been radicalized because thanks to the one child policy, they have lost everyone in their next generation
someone who's seen the death of a single child, right? Now has nothing to lose
And so the protests kept going and finally, the Chinese cracked down
That was enough of a citizen media
And so they began to arrest the protesters, they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening
China is probably the most successful manager of internet censorship in the world
Using something that's widely described is the great firewall of China
And the great firewall of China is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals, it mostly comes in from the outside world
It comes in in relatively sparse chunks and it comes in relatively slowly
And because of those four characteristics, they are able to filter it as it comes into the country
But like the Maginoline, the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge
Because not one of those four things was true in this environment
The media was produced locally
It was produced by Amateurs
It was produced quickly
And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared
And so now, the Chinese government who for a dozen years has quite successfully filtered the web is now in the position of having the decide whether to allow or shut down entire services, because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way
And in fact, that is happening this week on the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen
They just two days ago announced that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter because there was no way to filter it other than that
They had to turn the Spigot entirely off
Now, these changes don't just affect people who want to sense their messages
They also affect people who want to send messages
Because this is really a transformation
The ecosystem is a whole not just a particular stretch
The classic media prompt from the 20th centuries, how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of the network? And here's the 20th century answer
up the message, send the same message to everybody
National message, targeted individuals, relatively sparse number of producers, very expensive to do so there's not a lot of competition
This is how you reach people
All of that is over
We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global, social, ubiquitous, and cheap
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside of the distributed, distributed collection of the audience
Are now used to this change
The audience can talk back
And that's a little freaky, but you can get used to it after a while as people are doing
But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of
The really crazy change is here
It's the fact that there are no longer disconnected from each other
The fact that former consumers and now producers, the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another, because there's a lot more amateurs than professionals
And because the size of the network, the complexity of the network, is actually the square of the number of participants
Meaning that the network, when it grows large, grows very, very large
As recently as last decade, most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals
Those days are over, never to return
It is the green line's now that are the source of the freak
brings me to my last story
We saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the Obama campaign
And I don't mean most imaginative use in politics
I mean most imaginative use ever
And one of the things Obama did was the famously Obama campaign did, was they famously put up mybaracobamad
com, mybo
com, and millions of citizens rushed in to participate and to try and figure out how to help
And incredible conversations sprung up there
And then this time last year, Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
He had said in January he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons
By the summer, in the middle of the general campaign, he said, I thought about the issue more
I've changed my mind
I'm going to vote for this bill
And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk
It was Senator Obama when they created it, they changed the name later
Please get FISA right
Within days of this group being created, it was the fastest growing group on mybo
com within weeks of it being created, it was the largest group
And Obama had to issue oppressors
He had to issue a reply
And he said essentially, I've considered the issue
I understand what you're coming from
But having considered it all, I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me
And I'm going to take my lumps on this one
This didn't please anybody, but then a funny thing happened in the conversation
People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join, to deny its existence, to delete it, to take it off the site
They had understood that they're roll with mybode
com was to convene their supporters, but not to control their supporters
And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media
Media, the media landscape that we knew
As familiar as it was as easy, conceptually, as it was to deal with the idea, the professionals broadcast messages to amateurs
is increasingly slipping away
In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous, and cheap
In a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants in that world, media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals
There's more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups
And the choice we face, I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world, isn't whether that's the median environment we want to operate in
That's the median environment we've got
The question we all face now is how can we make best use of this median, even though it means changing the way we've always done it
Thank you very much
Thank you
I was thinking about my place in the universe and about my first thought about what infinity might mean when I was a child
And I thought that if infinity of time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, is not mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless
So we don't really have a place in the universe as far as on a timeline, but nothing else does either
And so therefore, every moment really is the most important moment that's ever happened, including this moment right now
And so therefore, this music you're about to hear is maybe the most important music you'll ever hear
And you're welcome

For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards, you could please refrain from saying, oh my god you're so much shorter in real life
Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion for some reason

I get it
I send interviews a lot
My god, your guitars are so gigantic
You must get them custom made special humongous guitars

Thank you very much
The beginning of any collaboration starts with the conversation and I would like to share with you the some of the bits of the conversation that we started with
I grew up in a lot of cabin in Washington State with too much time in my hands
And in scenic Switzerland for me, I always had a passion for alternative vehicles
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada
Combination of winterfing and skiing into this invention there
And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions
This is a 100,000 volt Tesla coil that I built in my bedroom, much to the smay of my mother
To the smay of my mother, this is dangerous teenage fashion right there
I brought this all together, this passion with alternative energy and race to solar car across Australia, also the US and Japan
So when power solar power, we had a lot to talk about
We had a lot that got us as excited
So we decided to do a special project together to combine engineering and design
And we'll make a fully integrated product, something beautiful
And we made a baby
Can you bring out our baby? This baby is fully electric
It goes 150 miles an hour
It's a twice the range of any electric motorcycle
We're really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design
It's got an amazing user experience
I was a wonderful working at the Bahar
Came up with our name and logo where mission motors
And we've only got three minutes, but we could talk about it for hours
Thank you
Thank you, Ted
And thank you, Chris
We're having a nice day
Let me talk about India through the evolution of ideas
Now, I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it because in every society, especially an open democratic society, it's only an idea-stake route that things change
It's only ideas lead to ideology, lead to policies that lead to actions
In 1930, this country went through a great depression which led to all the ideas of the state and social security and all other things that happened in Roosevelt's time
With the 1980s, we had the Reagan Revolution which led to deregulation and today, after the global economic crisis, there were whole news set of rules about how the state should intervene
So, ideas changed states and I looked at India and said, really there are four kinds of ideas which highly make an impact on India
The first to my mind is what I call as the ideas that I've arrived
that these ideas have brought together something which has made India happen the way it is today
The second set of ideas I call ideas in progress, those are ideas which have been accepted but not implemented yet
The third set of ideas are what I call is ideas that we argue about
Those are the ideas where we have a fight and ideological battle about how to do things
And the fourth thing which I believe is most important is the ideas that we need to anticipate Because when you're a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having, you can actually anticipate what they did and do things very differently
Now in India's case, I believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today
The first is really the notion of people
In the 60s and 70s, we thought of people as a burden
We thought of people as a liability
Today we talk of people as an asset
we talk of people as human capital
And I believe this change in the mindset of looking at people from something as a burden to human capital has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset
And this change in the thing of human capital is linked to the fact that India is going through a demographic dividend as healthcare improves as infant mortality goes down, fertilitates start dropping and India is experiencing that
And India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next 30 years
And what is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend
In other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world
And this is very important
At the same time, if you peel away the demographic dividend in India, there are actually two demographic curves
One is in the south and the west of India, which is already fully going to be fully expense by 2015, Because in that part of the country, there is the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a West European country
And then there's a whole Northern India, which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend
But a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital
Only if the people have education, they have good health, they have infrastructure, they have roads to go to work, they have light-sustradiate nights
Only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend
In other words, if you don't really invest in a human capital, the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster
And therefore, India is at that critical point, whether either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster
The second thing in India has been the chain in the role of entrepreneurs
When India got independence, entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot as people who would exploit
But today, after 60 years, because the rise of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs have become role models and they are contributing hugely to the society
And this change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy
The third big thing I believe that a change in India is our attitude towards the English language
English language was seen as a language of the imperialists, but today with globalization without sourcing, English has become a language of aspiration
And this has made something that everybody wants to learn
And the fact that we have English is now becoming a huge strategic asset
The next thing is technology
Fortiers back computers were seen as something which was forbidding something which is intimidating something that reduced jobs
Today we are in the country with sales 8 million mobile phones a month of which 90% of those mobile phones are pre-paid phones because people don't have credit history
And 40% of those pre-paid phones are recharge at less than 20 cents at each recharge
And that's the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible
And therefore technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something with empowering
20 years back, when they were the report on bank computation, they didn't call them, they didn't name the report as a report on computers
They call them as ledger posting machines
They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers
And when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computers, they called them advanced ledger posting machines
So if we come a long way from those days, where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment and really has changed the way Indians think of technology
And then I think the other point is that Indians today are far more comfortable with globalization
Again, after having lived for more than 200 years under the East India Company and under imperial rule, Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization, believing it of the form of imperialism
But today, as Indian companies go abroad, as Indians come and work all over the world, Indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something that can participate in
And the fact that the demographics are in our favor, because we are the only young country in the aging world, makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians
And finally, India has had the deepening of its democracy
democracy came to India 60 years back
It was an elite concept
It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth
But today, democracy has become a bottom of process where everybody has realized the benefits of being having a voice, the benefits of being an open society, and therefore democracy has become embedded
And I believe these six factors, The rise of the notion of population as human capital, the rise of Indian entrepreneurs, the rise of English as a language of aspiration, technology as something empowering, globalization as a positive factor, and the deepening of democracy has contributed to why India is today growing at race it has never seen before
But having said that, then we come to what I call as the ideas in progress
Those are the ideas where there is no argument in our society, but you're not able to implement those things
And really there are four things here
One is the question of education
For some reason, whatever reason, lack of money, lack of priorities, because of religion having an oral culture, time and education was never given the focus it required
But now I believe it's reached a point where it has become very important
Unfortunately, the government schools don't function
So children are going to private schools today, even in the slums of India, more than 50% of urban kids are going into private schools
So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work, But having said that, there's an enormous desire among everybody, including the poor to educate the children
So I believe, primary education and idea, which has arrived, but not yet implemented
Similarly, infrastructure
For a long time, infrastructure was not a priority
Those of you who have been to India have seen that, it's certainly not like China
But today, I believe, finally, infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement
It is reflected in a political statements
20 years back, the political slogan was Roti Kapra Makhan, which meant food, clothing, and shelter
And today's political slogan is Biji-Di-Sadak Pani, which means electricity, water, and roads
And that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted
So I do believe this an idea which has arrived, but simply not implemented
The third thing is again, cities, because Gandhi believed in villages and because the British ruled from the cities, And therefore, narrow thought of New Delhi as an unindian city for a long time we have neglected our cities and that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see
But today, finally, after economic reforms and economic growth, I think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth, cities are engines of creativity, cities are engines of innovation have finally been accepted
And I think now you're seeing the mood towards improving our cities again, an idea which has arrived but not yet implemented
And the final thing is the notion of India as a single market
Because when you didn't think of India as a market, you didn't really bother about a single market because you didn't really matter
And therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products, every province had its own market for agriculture
And increasingly now the policy is of taxation and infrastructure and all that are moving towards creating India as a single market
So there's a form of internal globalization, which is happening, which is as important as external globalization
And these four factors I believe, the ones of primary education, infrastructure, urbanization and single market in my view are ideas in India which have been accepted but not implemented
And then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict, the ideas that we argue about
And these are the arguments we have which cause gridlock
And what are those ideas? One is I think our ideological issues, because of the historical Indian background in the caste system and because of fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold, a lot of the politics is about how to make sure that we redress that and it leads to reservations and other techniques
It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people and all the left and right arguments that we have and a lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things
And this policy is causing gridlock
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved
The second one is the labor policies that we have, which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies that 93% of Indian labor is in the unorganized sector
And they have no benefits
They have no, they don't have social security, they don't have pension, they don't have healthcare, none of those things
And this needs to be fixed
Because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce, You will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised
And therefore, we need to create a new set of labor laws, which are not as honores as they are today, at the same time gave opportunity for a lot more people to be in the formal sector and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for
And the third thing is our higher education
Indian higher education is completely regulated
It's very difficult to start a private university
It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India
And as a result of that, our higher education is simply not keeping pace with India's demands
And that is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address
But most important I believe are the ideas we need to anticipate
And here, India can look at what's happened in the West and elsewhere and look at what's needs to be done
The first thing is we're very fortunate that technology is the point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development
So we can use technology for governance
We can use technology for direct benefits
We can use technology for transparency and many other things
The second thing is the health issue
India has equally horrible problems of the highest state of cardiac issues, the highest state of diabetes, the highest state of obesity
So there's no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases
And therefore we have to rethink the whole way we look at health
And we really need to put in place a strategy so that we don't go to the other extreme of health
Similarly, today in the West, you're seeing the problem of entitlement, the cost of social security, the cost of Medicaid, the cost of Medicaid
And therefore, when you're a young country, again, you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old
And then again, India does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty, because it has to marry environment and development
Just to give an idea, if the world has to stabilize at something like 20 gigatons per year on a population of 9 billion, our average carbon emission will have to be about 2 tons per year
India has already had 2 tons per year, but India grows at something like 8%
It will encompass a personal growth of 16 times at 20, 50
So we are saying income growing at 16 times, and no growth in carbon
And therefore we would fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment, the way we look at energy, the way we create whole new paradigms of development
Now, why do this matter to you? Why does what's happening 10,000 miles away matter to all of you? Number one, this matters because this represents more than a billion people, a billion people, one six of the world population
It matters because this is a democracy, and it's important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible, that you can have democracy, that you can have an open society and you can have growth
It's important because if you solve these problems, you can solve the problems of poverty in the world
It's important because you need it to solve the world's environment problem
If we're really going to come to a point, we want to put a cap on a carbon emission, we want to really lower the use of energy
It has to be solved in countries like India
If you look at the development in the West over 200 years, the average growth may have been about 2%
Here we are talking about countries growing at 8 to 9%
And that makes a huge difference
When India was growing at about 3
5%, and the population was growing at 2%
Its per capita income was doubling every 45 years
When the economic growth goes to 8%, and population growth drops to 1
5%
Then per capita income is doubling every nine years
In other words, you're certainly fast forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity and you must have a clear strategy which is important for India and important for the world
And that's why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am
Thank you very much
As Bruno said last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC and I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked
So this is it
For those of you that weren't there, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted
27 kilometers into conference
His job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billion to the second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second
second, so nothing, you've not ambitious
This is the machine below Geneva
We take the pictures of those many big bangs inside detectors
This is the one I work on
It's called the Atlas Detector
44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter
Spectacular picture here of Atlas under construction, so you can see the scale
On the 10th of September last year, we turned the machine on for the first time
And this picture was taken by Atlas
It caused immense celebration in the control room
is a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC, colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately and showering particles into the detector
In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10, we knew the machine works, which is a great triumph
I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer or this when some went on to Google
And so other front page was like that
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact
The better we played, so we had a problem with the machine
related actually to these bits of wire here, these gold wires
Those wires carry 13,000 amps when the machine's working at full power
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say, no, they don't
And then they're small wires
They can do that because when they're very cold, they what's called superconducting wire
So at minus 271 degrees, cold and the space between the stars, those wires can take that current
In one of the joins between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect
So the Y heated up slightly and it's 13,000 amd suddenly encountered electrical resistance
This was the result
Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets way over 20 tons and they moved about a foot
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets
We had to take them out, which we did
We've reconditioned them all, fixed them
They're all on their way back underground now
By the end of March, the LHC will be intact again
we will switch it on and we expect to take data in June or July
And continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are
Now, of course, in a way, those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge
It's easy to refute, I think, that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're over each and is the value of things like the LHC
I'll leave the final word to an English scientist from Rudevi, who I suspect when defending his protegés useless experiments, his protegé was Michael Faraday, said this, nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate, that there are no mysteries in nature that our triumphs are complete and that there are no new worlds to conquer
Thank you
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years, and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty
What does it mean? So often we look at dollar terms, people making less than a dollar or two or three a day, and yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable, because really it's a condition about choice and the lack of freedom
And I hadn't experienced that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that I have
It was in Kenya and I want to share it with you
I was with my friends who's a myzelist of photographer in the Mathari Valley slums
Now, Mathari Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa
It's about three miles out of Nairobi
And it's a mile long and about two tons of a mile wide
Where over half a million people live crammed in these little tin tracks
Generation after generation, renting them, often eight or 10 people to a room
And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs, a hard place to grow up
And when we were walking through the narrow alleys, it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes
But at the same time, it was also impossible not to see the human vitality, the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there, women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry
I met this woman, Mama Rose, who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years, where she lives with her seven children, four sleep in one twin bed and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor
And she keeps them on school by selling water from that kiosk and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside
It was also the day after the inauguration, And I was reminded how Matharya is still connected to the globe
And I would see kids on the street corners and they'd say, Obama, he's our brother and I'd say, well, Obama's my brother
So that makes you my brother too
And they would look quizzically at them, but they'd high five
And it was here that I met Jane
It was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness and her face
And I asked her to tell me her story
She started off by telling me her dream
She said, I had two
My first dream was to be a doctor
And the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family because my mother was a single mom and couldn't afford to pay for school fees
So I had to give up the first stream
And I focused on the second
She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away
And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with the second child
Her mom died and her husband left her married another woman
So she was, again, in Mithari, with no income, no skill set, no money, and so she ultimately turned to prostitution
Wasn't organized in the way we often think of it
She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls
Look for work and sometimes come back with a few shillings or sometimes with nothing
And she said, you know, the poverty wasn't so bad
It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all
In 2001, her life changed
She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jami Bora, that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were, as long as you provided, and the commensurate man in savings
And so she spent a year to save $50 and started borrowing
And over time, she was able to buy a sewing machine
She started tailoring
And that turned into what she does now, which is to go into the second-hand clothing markets
And for about $3
25, she buys an old ball gown
Some of them might be once you gave
And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women for their daughter's sweet 16 or first-to-the-communion, those milestones in her life that people want to celebrate all along the economic spectrum
And she does really good business
In fact, I watched her walk through the streets, hooking, and before you knew it, there was a crowd of women around her buying these dresses
And I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses, and also the jewelry that she makes, that now Jane makes more than $4 a day
And by many definitions, She is no longer poor, but she still lives in the Thore Valley
And so she can't move out
She lives with all of that insecurity and in fact, in January during the ethnic riots, she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack in which she would live
Jami Bora understands that, and understands that when we're talking about poverty, we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum
And so with patient capital for macumen and other organizations, loans and investments that will go the long-term with them
They built a low-cost housing development about an hour outside Nairobi Central
And they designed it from the perspective of customers like Jane herself, insisting on responsibility and accountability
So she has to give 10% of the total value or about $400 in savings
And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty
And in the next couple of weeks, She's going to be among the first 200 families to move into this development
When I asked her if she feared anything or whether she would miss anything from authority, she said, what would I fear that I haven't confronted already? I'm HIV positive
I've dealt with it all
And she said, and what would I miss? You think I will miss the violence or the drugs, the lack of privacy? Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are gonna come home at the end of the day? She said, if you gave me 10 minutes, my bags would be packed
And so I said, well, what about your dreams? And she said, well, you know, my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl
But if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband, but what I really wanted was a family that was loving
And I fiercely loved my children, and they loved me back
And she said, I thought I wanted to be a doctor, but what I really wanted to be was somebody who served and healed and cured
And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have
But two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients
And I say, look at me, you are not dead
You are still alive
And if you are still alive, you have to serve
And she said, I'm not a doctor who gives up pills, but maybe me, I give out something better because I give them hope
And in the middle of this economic crisis, we're so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear
I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out, recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary, because when systems are broken, like the ones that we're seeing around the world, it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation
It's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves
I truly believe it's where dignity starts
We owe it to the james of the world, and just as important, we owe it to ourselves
Thank you
Thank you
Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air
My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent and it was killing me
With the help of IIT, Terry and learning from NASA, we discovered that there are three basic green plants, common green plants with which we can grow
the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy
We've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building while maintaining industry into air quality standards
The three plants are Arika Palm, Motherland Law's Tongue and Money Plunt
The botanical names are in front of you
Arika Palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen
We need four shoulder high plants per person
And in terms of plant care, we need to wipe the leaves every day and daily
And perhaps once we can clean our cities, we have to grow them in very many more, which is to ride or hydroponics and take them outdoors every three to four months
The second plant is Motherland Law's tongue, which is again a very common plant
And we call it a bedroom plant because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night
And we need 6 to 8 waste high plants per person
The third plant is money plant
And this is again a very common plant, preferably grows in hydroponics
And this particular plant removes formalty hides another volatile chemicals
With these three plants, you can grow all the fresh air you need
In fact, you could be in a bottle with a cap on top and you would not die at all, and you would not need any fresh air
We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi, which is a 50,000 square feet, 20 year old building, and it has close to 1200 such plants for 300 occupants
Our studies have found that there is a 42% probability of one's blood oxygen going up by 1% One stage indoors and this building for 10 hours
The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the hellliest building in New Delhi
And the study showed that there is a compared to other buildings
There is a reduced incidence of I-E-R-Tation by 52% respiratory systems by 34% headaches by 24% long-roomed by 12% and asthma by 9% And this study has been published on September 8, 2008, and it's available on the garment of India website
Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20% by using these plants
And also, a reduction in energy requirements and buildings by an outstanding 15% because you need less fresh air
We're now replicating this in a 1
75 million square feet building
which will have 60,000 indoor plants
Why is this important? It is also important for environmental because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30% of the next decade
40% of the world's energy is taken up by building scarcely and 60% of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with population of over 1 million in the next 15 years
And there is a growing preference for living and working in air conditioned spaces
Be the change you want to see in the world, Sad Matmaghadhi, and thank you for listening
Thank you
I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids, ages six to eight at a children's museum, and I brought with me a bag full of legs, similar to the kinds of things you see up here, and had them laid out on a table for the kids
And for my experience, kids are naturally curious about what they don't know, we don't understand or is far into them
They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way and maybe sensors that natural curiosity or you know, reins in the question asking for the in the hopes of them being polite little kids
So I mean I could just picture the first great teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids saying now whatever you do, don't stare at her legs
And of course that's the point
That's why I was there
I want to invite them to look and explore
So I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own
So the doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs, and they are poking and prodding and they're wiggling toes and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that
And I said, kids, really quickly
I woke up this morning
I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house
Nothing too big, two or three stories
But if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character, anything you can dream up right now, What kind of legs would you build me? And immediately, a voice shouted, can't grew
No, no, no, she'd be a frog
No, it should be go-go gadget
No, no, no, it should be the incredibles and other things that I don't familiar with
And then when eight-year-old said, hey, why wouldn't you want to fly to? And the whole room, including me, was like, yeah
And just like that, I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as disabled, to somebody who had potential that their bodies didn't have yet
Somebody that might even be super able
Interesting
The sum of you actually saw me a TED 11 years ago
And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees and I am no exception
Ted literally was a launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration
At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs, wanted out of the hand leg of a cheetah, which you may have seen on stage yesterday
And also these very lifelike and intrinsically painted silicon legs
So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs
So that we can stop compartmentalizing, form, function, and aesthetic, and assigning them different values
We're lucky for me
A lot of people answered that call
And the journey started, funny enough, with a Ted Conference attendee
She's a parliament who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today
She was the editor of a magazine called ID
and she gave me a cover story
This started an incredible journey
Curious encounters were happening at the time
I've been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the Cheeto legs around the world
And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk, men and women
And the conversation would go something like this
You know Amy, you're very attractive
You don't look disabled
I thought, well, that's amazing
because I don't feel the same holds
And it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored about beauty
What does a beautiful woman have to look like? What does a sexy body? And interestingly, from an identity standpoint, what does it mean to have a disability? I mean, people, Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do
Nobody calls her disabled
So, so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer Peter Savel went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen and photographer Nick Knight, who were also interested in exploring that conversation
So, three months after Ted, I found myself on a plane to London doing my first fashion shoot, resulted in this cover, fashion, able
Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexandria McQueen on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash, nobody knew, everyone thought they were wooden boots
Actually I have them on stage with me
Great vines, my nollias, truly stunning
Poetry matters
Poetry is what Elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look and look a little longer and maybe even understand
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure, the artist, Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the Cremaster Cycle
This is where it really hit home for me that my legs could be wearable sculpture
And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate humanness as the only aesthetic ideal
So we made what people lovingly refer to as glass legs, even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane, aka bowling ball material
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil with potato root system growing in them and beat roots at the top and I'm very lovely brass toe
It's a good close of that one
Then another character was a half woman half cheetah, little homage to my life as an athlete
14 hours of prosthetic makeup to get into a creature that had articulated paws, claws, and a tail that whipped around
Like a gecko
And then another pair of legs, we collaborated on with these
look like jellyfish legs, also polyurethane
And the only purpose of these legs can serve outside the context of the film is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination
So whimsy matters
Today, I have over a dozen pair, a prosthetic legs that various people have made for me
And with them, I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet
And I can change my height
I have a variable of five different heights
Today I'm 61
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago, a door for the pediatric in England
And when I brought them home to Manhattan, my first night out in the town, I went to a very fancy party
And a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal 58
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me
And she went, but you're so tall
And I said, I know, isn't it fun? I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilltons stillt
But I have an entirely new relationship to doorjams that I never expected I would ever have
And I was having fun with it
And she looked at me and she said, but Amy, that's not fair
And the incredible thing was she really meant it
It's not fair that you can change your height as you want it
And that's when I knew that the conversation society has changed profoundly in this last decade
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency
It's a conversation about augmentation
It's a conversation about potential
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space
So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment and what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting edge technology, robotics, bionics, with the age-old poetry, we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity
I think that if we wanted to discover the full potential in our humanity, we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have
I think of Shakespeare's Shilock
If you prick us, do we not bleed? And if you tickle us, do we not laugh? It is our humanity and all the potential within it that makes us beautiful
Thank you
I'll now have been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense
A sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to metal information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever this ever coming across
And some of you may argue, well, don't today's cell phones do that already
But I would say no
When you meet someone here at TED and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year, you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you? Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, You don't take out your cellphone and open a browser and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make
So we don't really have easy access to all these relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take
So my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort and most successful efforts so far, which is still very much a work in process, actually wearing the device right now And we sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf and that by the way, only cost $350 at this point in time
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple webcam, a portable battery powered rejection system with a little mirror
These components communicate to my self-only my pocket, which acts as the communication and computation device
And in the video here, we see my student Pranath mystery who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him
The system tracks the four significance fingers, in this case, he's wearing simple marker caps, and you may recognize
But if you want a more stylish version, you could also paint your nails in different colors
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making
So he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, Zoom in and out, et cetera
The system also recognizes iconic gestures, such as the take-a-picture gesture and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you
And when he then walks back to the media lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them and resize them, etc
Again, using all natural gestures
So some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by the Jeff Han or some of you may think, well, it doesn't just look like the Microsoft Surface table
And yes, you also interact using natural gestures, both hands, et cetera
But the difference here is that you can use any surface
You can walk up to any surface, including your hand, if nothing else is available
interact with this project data, the device is completely portable and can be noticed
So one important difference is that it's totally mobile, another even more important difference is that in mass production, this would not cost more tomorrow, then today's cellphones and would actually not sort of be a bigger package and could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in minority report, the reason why we're really excited about his device is that it really We connect as one of these six sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you
So we see Pranath here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels
And as he picks up a product, the system can recognize the product that he's picking up using either image recognition or marker technology and give him the green light or an orange slide, he can ask for additional information
So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice given his personal criteria
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleaching it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice
But if he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get the Amazon rating, gets projected right on the cover of the book
This is Kwan's book, our previous speaker, which gets a great rating by the way, at Amazon
And so Pranath turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book
Read their comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, et cetera
If he turns to a particular page, he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page
Reading the newspaper, it never has to be outdated
You can get video annotations of events that you're reading about
You can get a latest sports course, et cetera
This is a more controversial one
As you interact with someone at TED, maybe, you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages, in this case, the student is interested in cameras, et cetera
On your way to the airport, if you pick up your boarding pass, you can tell you that your flight is delayed, that the gate has changed, et cetera
And if you need to know what the current time is, it's a simple as drawing a watch
on your arm
So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we make come across
My student Pronap who's really like I said, the genius behind this

because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months actually
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either
But it's not perfect yet
It's very much a working progress
And who knows, maybe in another ten years, will be here with the ultimate six-cent brain implant
Thank you
I wrote letters last week talking about the work of the foundations, sharing some of the problems, and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that, being honest about what was going well, what wasn't, and making it kind of an annual thing
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think There are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally
That is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things
And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand
But before I dive into those, I want to admit that I am an optimist
Any top problem I think it can be solved
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century, average lifespan is more than doubled
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite, is to look at childhood deaths
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of five
Five years ago, 135 million children were born, so more, and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five
So that's a factor of two reduction in the childhood death rate
It's a phenomenal thing
I mean, each one of those lives matters a lot
And the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising incomes, but also a few key breakthroughs, vaccines that were used more widely
For example, measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000
So we really can make changes
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years
Why? Well, there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria
And so that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning, which is, how do we stop a disease, a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes? What's the history of this disease? It's been a severe disease for thousands of years
In fact, we look at the genetic code
It's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malaria deaths
That's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s
So it was absolutely gigantic
And the disease was all over the world
Terrible disease
It was in the United States
was in Europe
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes
So it was everywhere
And two tools helped bring the death rate down
One was killing mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives
And so that's why the death rate did come down
Now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where all the rich countries are
So we can see 1900 it's everywhere, 1945 it's still most places
1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it
1990 you've gotten most in northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator
And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries, it doesn't get much investment
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria
Now baldness is terrible things
rich men are afflicted
And so that's why that priority has been set
But malaria, even the million deaths a year caused by malaria, greatly understated its impact
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because there's just it holds things back so much
Now I'm a Larry's course, Transmitabyte mosquitoes
I brought some here, so you could experience this
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit
There
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience
Those mosquitoes are not infected, but So we've come up with a few new things
We've got bad nets
And bad nets are a great tool
What it means is the mother and child stay into the bad net at night
And so the mosquitoes that bite lead at night can't get at them
And when you use indoor spraim with DDT and those nets, you can cut dats by over 50%
And that's happened now in a number of countries
It's great to see
But we have to be careful because malaria, the parasite evolves, and the mosquito evolves
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective
And so you end up with two choices
If you go into a country with the right tools in the right way, and you do it vigorously, you can actually get a local eradication
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking
or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time, you'll reduce the disease burden
But eventually, those tools will be coming effective and the death rate will soar back up again
And the world has gone through this, where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention
Now we're on the up-squing
Bednet funding is up
There's new drug discovery going on
Our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial
that starts in a couple months, and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective, and so we're going to have these new tools
But that alone doesn't give us the roadmap, because the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many things
It involves communicators to keep the funding hide, to keep the visibility hide, to tell the success stories
It involves social scientists, so we know how to get not just 70% of people who use the bad nets, but 90%
We need mathematicians to come and simulate this, to monitor all things, to understand how these tools combine and work together
Of course, we need drug companies to give us their expertise
We need ritual governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things
And so as these elements come together, I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria
Well, now let me turn to a second question
A fairly different question, but I'd say equally important
And this is, how do you make a teacher great? Now, seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well
And the answer is really, that we don't
Let's start with why this is important
Well, all of us here, I'll bat, had some great teachers
We all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today, part of the reason we're successful
I can say that even though I'm a college dropout, I had great teachers
And in fact in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places
So the top 20% of students have gotten a good education
And those top 20% have been the best in the world, if you measure them against the other top 20% and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U
S
at the forefront
Now, the strength for those top 20% is starting to fade on a relative basis, but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting
Not only has that been weak, it's getting weaker
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education
And so we have to change this
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity
We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education, like science and mathematics
When I first learned the statistics, I was pretty stunned at how bad things are
Over 30% of kids never finished high school
And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that
And so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30%
From an orny kids, it's over 50%
And even if you graduate from high school, if you're low income, you have less than a 25% chance of ever completing a college degree
If you're low income in the United States, you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree
And that doesn't seem entirely fair
So how do you make education better? Our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this
There's many people working on it
We've worked on small schools
We funded scholarships
We've done things in libraries
A lot of these things had a good effect
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing
And so we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile, the very best, and the bottom quartile
How much variation is there within a school or between schools? And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year
What does that mean? Well, that means that the entire U
S
for two years can have top quartile teachers, the entire difference between us and Asia would go away
And within four years, we would be blowing everyone in the world away
So it's simple
All you need is those top quartile teachers
And so you'd say, wow, that's good
We should reward those people
We should retain those people
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today
What are the characteristics of this top quartile? What do they look like? You might think, well, these must be very senior teachers
And the answer is no
One somebody is taught for three years
Their teaching quality does not change thereafter
The variation is very, very small
They might think, well, these are people with masters degrees
They've gone back and they've gotten their masters a education
This chart takes four different factors and says, how much do they explain teaching quality? That bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a masters degree
Now the way the P system works is there's two things that are rewarded
One is seniority because your pay goes up and you've asked in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people to get their master's degree
But in no way is associated with being a better teacher
Teach for America a slight effect from our teachers, majoring in math is a measurable effect
But overwhelmingly, it's your past performance
There are some people who are very good at this
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in, to replicate it, to raise the average capability, or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system
You might say, well, do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the systems, and it's a system with very high turnover
Now, there are a few places, very few, where great teachers are being made
Good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIP
KIP means knowledge is power
It's an unbelievable thing
They have 66 schools, mostly middle schools, seven high schools, and what goes on is great teaching
They take the poorest kids, and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school
Their team teaching, they're constantly improving their teachers
They're taking data, the test scores, and saying to a teacher, hey, you caused this amount of increase
And so they're deeply engaged in making teaching better
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms at first, it's very bizarre
I sat down and thought, what is going on? The teacher was running around and the energy levels I thought, well, I'm in the prep, the sports rally or something
What's going on? And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention, which kids were bored
And calling on kids rapidly, putting things up on the board, it was a very dynamic environment
Because particularly in those middle school years, fifth to eighth grade, keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention
Nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there, everybody needs to be involved
And so, Kip is doing it
How does that compare to a normal school? Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are
The data isn't gathered
In the teachers contract, it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom, sometimes to once per year
And they need advanced notice to do that
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers, some of them just making crap
And the management is told, hey, you can only come down here once a year, but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment
Even a teacher wants to improve, doesn't have the tools to do it
They don't have the test scores
And there's a whole thing of trying to block the data
For example, New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers
And so that's sort of working in the opposite directions
But I'm optimistic about this
I think there's some clear things we can do
First of all, there's a lot more testing going on, and that's given us the picture of where we are
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are
Of course, digital video is cheap now
Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say, OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly
Advise me when this kid acted up
How should I have dealt with that? and they can all sit and work together on those problems
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it, have it
So everyone sees who is the very best teaching this stuff
You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that
If you have a kid who's behind, you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the internet, but you could make it So that DVDs were always available, and so any body-wast access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system, we can do it much better
Now, there's a book actually about the place that this is going on that Jane Matthews, a news reporter called Work Hard Be Nice, and I thought it was so fantastic
give you a sense of what a good teacher does
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book
And we put a lot of money into education
And I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong of futures that should have
In fact, we have an stimulus bill, it's interesting that house version actually had money for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things
But I'm optimistic
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right
Why only had time to frame those two problems? There's a lot more problems like that
AIDS, pneumonia, I can just see or get him excited just at the very name of these things
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things
So it's going to take really people like you to study these things, get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions
And with that, I think there's some great things we'll come out of it
Thank you
Great creativity in time of need
We need great creativity, discuss
Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful
Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom, make education seem like a bright idea
Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation, or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so
Great creativity can make politicians electable or parties unelectable
It can make war seem like tragedy or fast
Creativity is the meme maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze
Science is clever, but great creativity is something less noble, more magical
And now we need that magic
This is a time of need
Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well, to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements, to tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener
You know, rather than drive today, I'm gonna walk and so you walk
And as he walk, he's often strange and wonderful things
He would not otherwise have seen a deer with an itchy leg, a flying motor spec
A father-in-dark separated from a bicycle by the mysterious wall
And then he stopped
Walking in front of him was her
The woman who has a child that skipped with him through fields and broken his heart
Sure, she'd age a little
In fact, she'd age a lot, but he felt all his old passion for her return
Ford, he called softly
That was her name
Don't say another word, Gusty, he said, but that was his name
I know a 10 next to a caravan exactly 300 yards from here
Let's go there
Make love
in the tent, for it on dress
She spread one leg and then the other
Gosty, enter her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him because she was a key name, but your pornography
The Earth moved from both of them and they lived together happily ever after
And all because he decided to walk that day
We've got the science we've had the debate, the moral imperative is on the table
Great creativity is needed to take it all, make it simple and sharp, to make it connect, to make it make people want to act
So this is a call, a plea to the incredibly talented Ted community
Let's get creative against climate change, and let's do it soon
Thank you
APPLAUSE
I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature
And so I have my first slide to talk about the donning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation that is looking at the relics of creation and ensuring what happened at the beginning and then following it up and trying to understand it
And so one of the questions that I asked you is when you look around what do you see? Well, you see this space that's created by designers and by the work of people
But what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here of being reshaped in a certain form
And so the question is, how did that material get here? How did it get into the form you had before? It got reshaped and so forth
It's a question of what's the continuity? So one of the things I look at is, how did the universe begin and shape what was the whole process and the creation and the evolution of the universe? to the getting to the point that we have these kind of materials
So that's sort of part, and let me move on, then show you the Hubble Ultra-D field
As you look in this picture, what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it
And everything, but four of these light objects are stars, and you can see them there little pluses
This is a star
This is a star
Everything else is a galaxy
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies
You can see easily with your eye in here
And when I look out, it particularly this galaxy which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's an art design college conference going on
And until it's been being there or thinking about, what designs I might do, and there might be a few, because I'm all just trying to understand where the universe itself came from
And there might even be some on that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what's going on over here
But there's a lot of other galaxies in summer nearby, and they're kind of the color of the sun, in summer, further away, and they're a little blue, and so forth
But one of the questions is, this should be to you, how come there's so many galaxies? Because this represents a very teeny fraction of the sky
This is only a thousand galaxies
We think there's on the order visible to the Hubble say telescope if you have the time of the scan and around about 100 billion galaxies
It's a very large number of galaxies
And that's roughly how many stars there are on our own galaxy
But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see more galaxies and stars, which is kind of a conundrum
So the question should come to your mind is what kind of design, what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that
And then I'm going to tell you, it's actually a lot more complicated
We're going to try and follow it up
We have a tool that actually helps us out in the study
And that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine in a certain sense
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away
So you can see it put the earth at the center of the nested spheres, just because that's for making observations
And the moon is only two seconds away
So if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light, this is the moon two seconds ago, and who cares? Two seconds is like the present
The sun is eight minutes ago
That's not such a big deal
Unless it's all of our flares coming, you want to go the other way
You'd like to have advanced morning
But you get out to Jupiter in its 40 minutes away
It's a problem, you hear about Mars
It's a problem communicating to Mars, because it takes light long enough to go there
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars, so the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years
to pick and take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy is thousands of years ago
You look at end drama, which is the nearest big galaxy
And it's 2 million years ago
If you took a picture of the Earth 2 million years ago, there'd be no evidence of humans at all because we don't think they were humans yet
I mean, it just gives you the scale
And with Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to billion years
But if we were capable to come up with an idea how to look even further to sense things even further, And that was what I did a lot of my work was to develop the techniques
And we could look out back to even earlier effects before there were stars and before there were galaxies back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different
And so that's the sort of sequence
And so I have a more artistic impression of this
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way and around it are the Hubble nearby kind of galaxies
And there's a sphere that marks the different times
And behind that are some more modern galaxies
You see the whole big picture
So beginning of time is funny, it's on the outside
And then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot
Like can't escape
It's like you can't see the center of the sun
You have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the sun
But you can see the edge of the sun and the universe gets that way
And you can see that
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside
And that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang, which is actually incredibly uniform
The universe is almost a perfect sphere
But there are these very tiny variations, which we show here in great exaggeration
And from them in the time sequence, we're gonna have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars, to these more advanced galaxies and eventually this solar system, so forth
So it's a big design job, but we'll see how things are going on
So the way this measurements were done has been to set a satellites, and this is where you get to see
So there was the Kobe satellite, which was launched in 1989, And we discovered these variations
And then in 2000, the map satellite was launched, the W map, and it made somewhat better pictures
And later this year, this is the cool stealth version, the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it
And it's the planks satellite will be launched, and it will make very high-ros vision maps
And that will be the sequence of understanding in the very beginning of the universe
And what we saw was we sound these variations, and then they told us the secrets, both about the structure of space time and about the content of the universe and about how the universe started in its original motions
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture, and I'll come back to it at the beginning, where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning, and we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe expands and cools, and until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent, then the dark ages and then the first stars turn on, and they evolve into galaxies, and the later they get to the more expensive galaxies
And somewhere around this period is when there are some systems start deforming and it's maturing up to the present time
And there's some spectacular things
And this waste basket part, that's the represent what the structure of space time itself is doing during this period
And so this is a pretty weird model
What kind of evidence do we have for that? So let me show you some of nature's patterns that are results of this
I always think of space time as being the real substance of space and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever we're going on
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies
There's dot on here for every galaxy
They go out and point it up to the sky, take a picture, identify what are stars and throw them away
Look at the galaxies, estimate how far away they are and plot them up
And just put radially, they're going out that way
And you see these structures this thing we call the Great Wall
And what there's voids and those kind of stuff
And they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it
Now I'm going to show you this in 3D
What happens is you take pictures as the Earth rotates you get a plan across the sky
There's some places you can't look because of our own galaxy or because there are no telescopes available to do it
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this, rotating around
You see the fan like scans made across the sky
Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy
And you see the galaxies in our neighborhood
And you sort of see this structure
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall
And you see the complicated structure
And you see these voids
They're places where there are no galaxies and they're places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together
So there's an interesting pattern
But we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern
We only have a million galaxies
So we're keeping like a million balls in the air
but what's going on? So there's another survey which is very similar to this called the 2 degree field of view, Galaxy Redshift survey
Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million
And every time there's a galaxy at its location, there's a galaxy, and we know if we know anything about the galaxy, which you do, because there's a redshift measurement, everything
You put in the type of galaxy in the color
So this is the river representation
And when you're in the middle of the galaxy, it's hard to see the pattern
It's like being in the middle of life
It's hard to see the pattern
middle of the audience, it's hard to see the pattern of this
So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this
And you will see the first structure of the survey, and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there
So again, you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here
But you can see the voids, you can see the complicated structure And you say, well, how did this happen? Suppose you're the cosmic designer
How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that? It's not just throwing them out at random
There's a more complicated process going on here
How are you going to end up doing that? And so now we're in for some serious play
But as we have to seriously play God, not just change people's lies, but make the universe
So if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that? What's the kind of technique? What's the kind of thing you're going to do? So I'm going to show you the results of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like using essentially some of the play principles and some of the design principles that humans have labored so hard to pick up what apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning
And that is you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules and what you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated
And then you put in some randomness, some fluctuations, and some randomness, and realize a whole bunch of different representations
So what I'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales we're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out, it was called dark matter
That is matter that doesn't interact with light, the typical way that ordinary matter does, the way the light shining on me or on the stage
It's transparent to light
But in order for you to see it, we're going to make it white
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter
You should be called invisible matter, the dark matter made visible
And then the stuff that is in the yellow color, that is the ordinary kind of matter, is turned into stars and galaxies
So I'll show you the next movie
So this we're going to zoom in
Notice this pattern
And pay attention to this pattern
We're going to zoom in and zoom in
And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids
And when a number of filaments come together and do not, that makes a super cluster of galaxies
This one we're zooming in on is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in a small region
So we live in the boonies
We don't live in the center of the solar system
We don't live in the center of the galaxy
And our galaxy's not in the center of a big cluster
So we're zooming in
This is a region which probably has more than 100,000 on the order of a million galaxies in that region
We're going to keep zooming in
Okay, and so I forgot to tell you the scale
A parsec is 3
26 light years, so gigaparsec is 3 billion light years, that's the scale
So it takes light 3 billion years to travel over that distance
Now we're into a distance, so between here and here, this is a distance between us and in drama, right? These little specs that you're seeing here, they're galaxies
Now we're gonna zoom back out
And you can see this structure that when we get very far out looks very regular
It's made up of a lot of irregular variations
So there's simple building blocks
There's a very simple fluid that begin with
It's got dark matter, Scott ordinary matter
It's got photons, and it's got neutrinos, which don't play much role in the later part of the universe
And it's just a simple fluid
And it's over time, develops into this complicated structure
And so now, when you first saw this picture, didn't mean quite so much to you
Here, you're looking across 1% of the volume of the visible universe, and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right? And nodes
But you realize they're not even the main structure
There's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter, the South there, that's actually holding it all together
So let's slide through it
And you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this out
So here's that same end result
You see a filament
You see the white is the invisible matter, and the yellow is the star of the galaxies showing up
And we're going to fly around and we'll fly around and you'll see some occasionally a couple settlements intersect and you get a large cluster of galaxies
And then we'll fly in where the very large cluster is, and you can see what it looks like
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated
It's only when you look at it on a really large scale and explore it and so forth
you realize it's a very intricate, complicated kind of a design
And it's grown up in some kind of way
So the question is, how hard would it be to assemble this? How big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together? That's an issue
And so here we are
You see how the filament, you see how several filaments are coming together and therefore making this super cluster of galaxies
And you have to understand this is not how it actually look if you were first you can't travel this fast but everything would be distorted but this is using simple rendering graphic arcs kind of stuff
This is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to you if you could see in a little matter too
And so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe in a very simple way? We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe, everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments, was once an a region that was smaller than an atom
It started with tiny quantum mechanics fluctuations, but expanding in a tremendous rate And those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes
And those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the causing microwave background
And then we need some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and to make these kind of structures go on
So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation
This simulation was run on a thousand processors for a month in order to make just a simple visual one
So I'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture
So you start out with teeny fluctuations when in the nearest was at this point now four times smaller
And so forth
And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming
And this is a simple one because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it
And you see how the dark matter lumps up
And the ordinary matter just trails along behind
So there it is
At the beginning it's very uniform
The fluctuations are apart in 100,000
It's a few peaks that are apart in 10,000
And then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in
This is light over density, pulls the material around in
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material
But the distance is on the universe as so large, and the timescale is so large, that it takes a long time for this to form
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now, and in terms of a expansion
And at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of large scale structure
So we're just seeing as large scale structure as we can see
And then the only things that have started forming already are going to form then from then on
So it's going to go on
So we're able to do this simulation
But this is two days on a desktop
We need 30 days on a thousand processors to do this kind of simulation that I showed you before
So we have an idea of how to play seriously creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedrope full of material, right? And we create everything we can see in any direction, right? From almost nothing, that is something extremely tiny, extremely small
And it is almost perfect, except it has these tiny fluctuations at a partner 100,000 level, which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and design we see that is galaxies and stars and so forth
So we have a model and we can calculate it and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like and that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was
So this is what we started with 15 years ago with the Cosmic Backgroundist Glor, made the map and the upper right which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations, and actually fluctuations on several scales
You can kind of see that
Since then, we've had WMAP, which just gives us higher angle resolution
We see the same large scale structure, but we see additional small scale structure
And on the bottom right is, if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth, what kind of a map we've gotten the Earth, you could see, well, you can kind of pick out all major continents, but that's about it
But what we're hoping when we get the plank will have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the earth
And you can also tell because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together
There's some nonlinear processes
There's geology has these effects in which is moving the plates around
And so you can see that just from the map alone
We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe
We can see whether they're really nonlinear effects that are starting to move to modify And it gives a hint about how space time itself was actually created at the beginning moments
And so that's where we are today
And that's what I wanted to give you a flavor of
Give you a different view about what the design and whatever everything else looks like
Thank you
Thank you
Speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion
The truth of the matter is otherwise
Our holy book, the Quran, consists of 114 chapters and each chapter begins with what we call the best smeller, the saying in the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful, or as Sir Richard Burton, not the Richard Burton was made to Elizabeth Taylor, but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature, translates it as in the name of God, the compassionating the compassionate
And in a saying of the Quran, which for the Muslims is God speaking to humanity, God says to his prophet Muhammad, whom we believe to be the last of our series of prophets, beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham, including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad, said that we have not sent you or Muhammad, except as a Rahma, except as a source of compassion to humanity
And for us human beings and certainly for us as Muslims, whose mission and whose purpose, in following the path of the Prophet, is to make ourselves as much like the Prophet and the Prophet in one of his saying said, Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God
And because God himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion
In fact, the Quran says that God decreed upon himself compassion, or reigned himself in by compassion
Therefore our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion, activators of compassion, actors of compassion, and speakers of compassion, and doers of compassion
That is all well and good
But why do we go wrong? And what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world? For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path
In every religious tradition, there is what you call the outer path and the inner path, or the exoteric path and the exoteric path
The esoteric path of Islam is more popular in known as Sufism, or Tasawwaf in Arabic
And these doctors, or these masters, these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition, refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lie
In one of the battles that the Prophet waged, he told his followers, we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war, to the greater battle
And they said, messenger of God, we are battle weary
How can we go to a greater battle? Because that is the battle of the Self, the battle of the ego
The sources of human problems have to do with egoitism
I, the famous Sulphi Master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you, has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and knocks on the door voice answers, who's there? It's me or more grammatically correctly, it is I, as we might say in English
The voice says, go away
After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle, he comes back and with much greater humility he knocks again on the door
The voice asks, who is there? It is you, oh, hot breaker
The door swings open, and the voice says, come in
For there is no room in this house for two eyes, to capital eye, not this eyes, the, for two egos
And roomy stories are metaphors for the spiritual path
In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one eye, and that is the eye of divinity
In a teaching, what is called a Hadith Qutzi in our tradition, God says, that my servant, or my creature, my human creature, does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to do
And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean
You want your employees to do what you asked them to do
And if they've done that, then they can do extra
But don't ignore what you've asked them to do
And God says, my servant continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what I've asked them to do, extra credit with my call it, until I love him or love her
And when I love my servant, God says, I become the eyes by which he or she sees
The ears by which he or she listens
The hand by which He or she or she grasps and the foot by which He or she walks and the heart by which He or she understands
It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions
in the name of the Prophet, the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, the messenger of the Prophet, of God
They became part of God's team so that God's will was manifested through them and not acting from their own self, from their own ego
Compassion on earth is given
It is in us
All we have to do is to get our ego out of the way
Get our ego-tism out of the way
I'm sure
probably all of you here of certainly the very vast majority of you have had what you might call a spiritual experience
A moment in your lives, when for a few seconds a minute perhaps the boundaries of your ego dissolved and at that minute you felt at at one with the universe
One with that jug of water, one with every human being, one with the creator, and you felt in the presence of power, of all, of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassionate mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives
That is a moment which is a gift of God to us
A gift when for a moment he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on I, I, I, me, me
And instead, like the person in the room is story, we say, Oh, this is all you
This is all you
And this is all us
And us and I and us, all part of you, all Creator, all the objective, the source of our being, and the end of our journey, you are also the breaker of our hearts
You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live, and for whose purpose we shall die and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God, to what extent we have been compassionate beings
Our message today and our purpose today and those of us of you who are here today and And the purpose of this chart of compassion is to remind for the Quran always urges us, to remember, to remind each other because the knowledge of truth is within every human being
We know it all
We have access to it all
Young may have called it the subconscious
Through our subconscious, in your dreams, which we call, all, the core uncorse, our state of sleep, the lesser death, the temporary death
In our state of sleep, we have dreams, we have visions, we travel, even outside of our bodies for many of us
And we see wonderful things
We travel beyond the limitations of spaces we know it and beyond the limitations of time as we know it
But all this is for us to glorify the name of the Creator, whose primary name is the compassionating the compassionate
God, Bach, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om, whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity is the locust of absolute being, absolute love and mercy and compassion, an absolute knowledge and wisdom
Hindu schools such as Tantanda
The language differs but the objective is the same
Rumi has another story about three a Turk and Arab and I forget the third person but for my sake it could be a Malay
One is asking for Angur, one is saying Englishman, one is asking for a Arab and one is asking for grapes and they go have a fight and an argument Because I want grapes, I want to end up, I want Angkor, not knowing that the word that they're using refers the same reality in different languages
There's only one absolute reality by definition
One absolute being by definition, because absolute is by definition single and absolute and singular
There's this absolute concentration of being, the absolute concentration of consciousness, awareness, and absolute locus of compassion, and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity
And that should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human
for what defines humanity, perhaps biologically, is our physiology
But God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature
In the Quran says, he speaks to the angel and says, when I have finished the formation of Adam from clay and breathed into him of my spirit and fall in frustration to him
The angels prostrate not before the human body, but before the human soul why? Because the soul, the human soul embodies a piece of the divine breath, a piece of the divine soul
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image
What is the imagery of God? The imagery of God is absolute being, absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love
and therefore for us to be human, in the greatest sense of what it means to be human
In the most joyful sense of what it means to be human, means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us
And to seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being, of being alive, of beingness, the attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness, and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings
This is what I understand from my faith tradition
And this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions
And this is the common platform on which we must all stand
And when we stand on this platform as such, I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world
And I believe personally that we are on the verge and that with the presence and help of people like you here, we can bring about
prophecy of Isaiah, where he fought hold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plow shares and will not learn war and make war anymore
We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option
must we must lower our egos, control our egos, whether it is individual ego, personal ego, family ego, national ego, and that all be for the glorification of the one
Thank you and God bless you
A human child is born and for quite a long time, it is a consumer
It cannot be consciously a contributor
It is helpless, it doesn't know you and how to survive
Even though it is in doubt with an instinct to survive, it needs the help of mother or your foster mother to survive
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child
It has to totally surrender as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist
It has to totally surrender that implies a lot of trust, that implies the trusted person won't violate the trust
As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust
It doesn't know even the word violation
Therefore it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve, a wordless self blame
As the child grows to become an adult, so far it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributor
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure, one feels big
One feels, I am, I have enough
To be compassionate is not a joke
He's not that simple
One has to discover a certain business in oneself, that business should be centered on oneself, not in terms of money, not in terms of power you wield, not in terms of any status that you can command in the society
What it should be sent at on oneself, the self you are self aware, on that self it should be sent at a bigness, a wholeness, otherwise compassion is just a word and a dream
You can be compassionate, occasionally
More moved by empathy than by compassion
Thank God we are empathetic
And somebody is in pain, we pick up the pain in a Wimbledon, match, final match
These two guys fight it out
Each one has got two games
It can be anybody's game
What they have swatted so far as no meaning
One person wins
The tennis etiquette is both the players have to come to the net and shake hands
The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground, throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for him
And this guy has to come to the net when he comes to the net
You see his whole face changes
It looks as though he is wishing that he didn't win
Why? Yempathy
That's human heart
No human heart is denied of that Yempathy
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination
No culture, no nation and nationalism, nothing can touch it because it is empathy
And that capacity to sympathize is the window through which you reach out to people
You do something that makes the difference in somebody's life, even words
Even time, compassion is not defined in one form
There is no Indian compassion
There is no American compassion
It transcends nation, gender, age, why because it is there in everybody
It's experienced by people, occasional
In this occasional compassion, we are not talking about
It will ever remain a occasion by mandate you cannot make a person compassionate
You can't say, please loamy
Now it's something you'll discover
It's not an action
But in English language, it is also an action
I will come to it later
So one has got to discover your certain wholeness
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experience
Despite the fact that a very tragic life, one is happy in moments which are very few and forbitary and the one who is happy even for a slapstick joke, accept himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself
That means the whole universe, known things and unknown things
All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself
subject me and the object, the scheme of things, fuse into one's, an experience nobody can say I am denied of
An experience common to all and sundry
That experience confirms that in spite of all your limitations, all your wants, desires, and fulfill the credit cards and layoffs and finally, baldness
You can be happy
The extension of the logically, that you don't need to fulfill a desire to be happy
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be
There is no choice in this
That only confirms the reality
But the wholeness cannot be different from you
cannot be minus you
It has got to be you
You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole
A moment of happiness reveals that reality, that realization, that recognition
Maybe I am the whole
Maybe the Swami is right
Maybe the Swami is right
You start a new life
Then everything becomes meaningful
I have no more reason to blame myself
One has to blame oneself, one has got million reasons plus many
But if I say in spite of my body being limited, if it is black, it is not white
If it is white, it is not black
What is limited? In a which way you look at it, limited
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited, and powers therefore limited, and the cheerfulness is going to be limited
Compassion is going to be limited
Everything is going to be limitless
You cannot command compassion
unless you become limitless and nobody can become limitless, either you are or you are not
Period
And there is no way of your being not limitless too
Your own experience reveals, you spite of all limitations, you are the whole
The coldness is the reality of view
When you relate to the world, it is love first
When you relate to the world, the dynamic manifestation of the coldness is what we say, love
And it self becomes compassion
If the object that you relate to, you've worked that emotion, then that again transforms into giving, into sharing, you express yourself because you have compassion
discover compassion, you need to be compassionate
To discover the capacity to give and share, you need to be giving and sharing
There is no shortcut, it is like swimming by swimming
You learn swimming by swimming
You cannot learn swimming in a full mattress and enter into water
You learn swimming by swimming, you learn cycling by cycling, you learn cooking by cooking, having some sympathetic people around you to eat what do you cook? And therefore what I say, you have to fake it and make it
You need my predecessor, men that, you have to act it out
You have to act compassionately
There is no work for compassion
But you have an adverb for compassion
That's interesting to me
You act compassionately
But then how to act compassionately if I don't have compassion
That is where you fake
You fake it and make it
This is the mantra of United States of America
You fake it and make it
You act compassionately
As though you have compassion, grind your teeth
Take all the support system
And if you know how to pray, pray, ask for compassion
Let me act compassionate
Do it
You'll discover compassion and also slowly, a relative compassion and slowly perhaps if you get the right teaching, you will discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself which is oneness, wholeness and that's what you are
With this words, thank you very much
This means I'm smiling
So does that? This means mouse
Cat? Here we have a story
The start of the story where this means guy
And that is a ponytail on a passerby
Here's where it happens
These are when
This is a cassette tape
The girl puts into her cassette tape player
She wears it every day
It's not considered vintage
She just likes certain music to sound a certain way
Look at her posture
It's remarkable
That's because she dances
Now, he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring honestly, geez
What are my chances? And he could say, oh my God
Or, I heart you
I'm laughing out loud, I wanna give you a hug, but he comes up with that
He tells her, I'd like to hand paint your portrait on a coffee mug
He could have put a crab inside it, add some water, seven different salts
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land, but just panhandle it the ocean
He says, you look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz
and the girl goes, wow
So the guy replies, yeah, I know, I know, I think my heartbeat might be the Morris Code for inappropriate, at least that's how it seems
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes
For swearing awkward silences and very simple rhyme schemes, right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy
I'm a monkey
blowing kisses at a butterfly
But I'm still suggesting you and I should mean
First, soon, and then a lot
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5042 and it noon tomorrow, but I'll stay until you show up
Ponytail or not
Hell, ponytail alone
I don't know what else to tell you
I got a pencil you can borrow
You can put it in your phone, but the girl does not bunch, does not smile, does not frown
She just says, no thank you, you know? Thank you
Hi, I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration, and thank you and having a be specific in genuine
And the way I got interested in this was I noticed in myself when I was growing up and until about a few years ago that I would want to say thank you to someone I would want to praise and I'd want to take in their praise of me and I'd stop it
And I asked myself, why? I felt shy, felt embarrassed
And then my question became, am I the only one who does this side of the game? I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility so I get to see people who are facing life in death with addiction
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as their core wound is their father died with, without ever saying he's a prodigom
But then they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that He was proud of him, but he never told the sun, because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need? I know a gentleman married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, thank you for being the breadwinners, so I could stay home with the kids
But won't ask
I know woman who's good at this
She wants a week meets with her husband, and says, I really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house
And with the kids, and he goes, and he goes, oh, this is great, this is great, And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that in the friend of my April who I've had since kindergarten
She thanks her children for doing their chores
And she said, why wouldn't I think it even though they're supposed to do it? So the question is, why was I blocking it? Why were other people blocking it? Why can I say I'll take my stake medium rare I need size six shoes? But I won't say, would you praise me this way? And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me
I'm telling you where I'm insecure
I'm telling you where I need your help
And I'm treating you my inner circle like you're the enemy
Because what can you do with that data? You couldn't neglect me? You could abuse it? Or you could actually meet my need
And I took my bike into the bike store
I love this same bike
And they do something called trueing the wheels
The guy said, you know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better
I get the same bike back
And they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years
my bike is like new
So I'm going to challenge all of you
I want you to true your wheels, be honest about the praise that you need to hear
What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife, go ask her what does she need? Go home to your husband, what does he need? Go home and ask those questions and then help the people around you
And it's simple
And why should we care about this? We talk about world peace
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages? I think it starts household by household, under the same roof
So let's make it right in our own backyard
Now, I wanted to thank all of you and the audience for being great husband, great mothers, friends, daughters, sons
And maybe somebody has never said that to you, but you've done a really, really good job
And thank you for being here and just showing up and changing the world with your ideas
Thank you
Thank you
The decorative use of wire and southern Africa dates back hundreds of years
But modernisation, actually bought communication and a whole new material in the form of telephone wire
Rural to open migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to place hard to come by natural grasses
So here you can see the change from use starting to use contemporary materials
These pieces date back from the 40s to the late 50s
In the 90s, my interest in passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a sportic camp outside Durban
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point and started developing really and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design, and the project soon grew from 50-50 rivers in a bar to year
Soon we had of grown the scrapyards what they could provide
So we could hear why I'm in effect to help us
And we're not only to supply the materials and on bobbins but to produce our color specifications
At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary
So I developed a whole range around a mass-produced range that obviously fitted in too much high in Dick Hormack that could be exported and also service our local market
We started experimenting as you can see in terms of shapes, forms, the scale will become very important and it's become our pit project, it's a tassel, it's been running for 12 years and we supply the current shafts and Donna Care And it's kind of great
This is our group, our main group of weevers
They come on a weekly basis to do it
They all have bank accounts
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from
It's a weekly turnaround of production
This is the community that our energy needs to show you the slide of
And that's also modernized today
And it's supporting work for 300 weevers
And the race is at all
Thank you very much
Thank you
I had a fire nine days ago
My archive is 175 films
My 16 millimeter negative
All my books, my dad's books, my photographs
I had collected
I was a collector major big time
It's gone
I just looked at it and I didn't know what to do
I mean, this was, was I my things? I always live in the present
I love the present
I cherished a future
And I was taught some strange things that kid, like, you gotta make something good out of something bad
You gotta make something good out of something bad
This was bad, man
I cough, I was sick, that's my camera lens
The first one, the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago, that's my feature film King Murray, one console festival in 1970
The only print I had, that's my papers
That was in minutes, it's 20 minutes
I pissed and he hit me, something hit me
You got to make something good out of it, something bad
I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister
By the way, that's Spartanic I ran it last year
Sputnik was downtown, the negative it wasn't touched
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film which opens in New York in two weeks at downtown
I call my sister, I call my neighbors, I said, come dig, that's me at my desk
I was a desk took 40, yum to use to build, all the stuff
That's my daughter, Jean
She came, she's a nurse in San Francisco
Dig it up, I said, pieces, I want pieces, bits I came up with this idea, a life of bits and pieces, which I'm just starting to work on
My next project, that's my sister
She took care of pictures, because I was a big collector of just snapshot photography that I believed said a lot, and those are some of the pictures that something was good about the burned pictures
I didn't know
I looked at that, I said, wow, is that better than, that's my proposal on Jimmy Doodle
I made that movie for television
It's only copy I had
pieces of it, idea by women
So I started to say, hey, man, you are too much
You could cry about this
I really didn't
I didn't stand said, I'm going to make something out of it
And maybe next year, and I appreciate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people who've already given me so much solace and just say the Ted's, I'm proud of me that I take something bad, I turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this
all these pieces, that's awful life's exerregional photograph I loved
I was a big record collector
The records didn't make it boy
I'll tell you, film burns
Film burns
I mean, this was 16 millimeter safety film
The negatives are gone
That was my father's letter to me, telling me to marry the woman I first married when I was 20
It's my daughter and me
She's still there
She said this morning, actually, that's my house
My family is living in the Hilton hotel in Scott's Valley
That's my wife, Heidi
Who didn't take it as well as I did
My children, David and Henry, my son, David, and the hotel two nights ago
So my message to you folks for my three minutes is that I appreciate the chance to share this with you
I will be back
I love being a Ted
I came to live it and I am living it
That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz and body doing just 35 miles from here
Thank you, everybody
Thank you
Thank you
I'm just going to go ahead and get the start
This is a work in process based on some comments that were made at Ted two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine
So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teach teacher who talked about absorption refrigeration
It was one of those things that stuck in my head
It was a lot like the Sterling Engine
It was cool, but you didn't know what to do with it
And it was invented in 1858 by this guy, Ferdinand Carrey, but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time
It's crazy, crazy Canadian, and empower, crawlsly, commercialized this thing called the icy ball in 1928
And it was a really neat idea
And I'll get to why I didn't work
But here's how it works
There's two spheres in the separated indistence
One has a working fluid, water, and ammonia
The other is a condenser
You heat up one side, the hot side, the ammonia evaporates, and it recondenses in the other side
You let it cool to room temperature
And then as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the earth's wild hot side, it creates a powerful cooling effect
So it was a great idea
Didn't work at all
They blew up
Because they're using ammonia, you get hugely high pressures
If you heat it them wrong, they get a top 400 psi The ammonia was toxic, it's spray everywhere
But it's kind of an interesting thought
So the great thing about 2006, there's a lot of really great computational work you can do
So we got the whole thermodynamics department that Stanford involved, a lot of computational fluid dynamics
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong
We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures brought in a team from the UK
There's a lot of great refrigeration people turn down in the UK and built a test rig and proved that in fact we could make a low pressure non-toxic refrigerator
So this is the way it works
You put it on a cooking fire
Most people have cooking fires in the world whether it's camel-dunner would heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour
You put it into a container and it'll refrigerate for 24 hours
It looks like this, this is the fifth prototype, it's not quite done
weighs about eight pounds and this is the way it works
You put it into a 15-liter vessel about three gallons and it'll cool it down to just above freezing
Three degrees above freezing for 24 hours and a 30-degree sea environment
It's really cheap
We think we can build these in high volumes for about $25 in low volumes for about $40
And we think we can make a refrigeration something that everybody can have
Thank you
One way to change our genes is to make new ones as Craig Ventor has so elegantly shown
Another is to change our lifestyles
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits
When you eat healthier, managed stress, exercise, and love more, your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen
But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger
things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now
This was a figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us
Now there's some things that you can do to make your brain grow into brain cells, some of my favorite things like chocolate and tea, blueberries, alcohol and moderation, stress management, and cannabinoids found in marijuana
Kind of just a messenger
What were we just talking about? And other things that can make it worse, it can cause you to lose brain cells, the usual suspects like saturated fat and sugar, nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle
So you age less quickly, your skin doesn't wrinkle as much
Your heart gets more blood flow
We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease that these clogged arteries that you the upper left after only a year become measureably less clogged
And the cardiac pet scan shown in the lower left, the blue means no blood flow
A year later, Argin White is maximum of blood flow
We've shown you may be able to stop a reverse progression of early prostate cancer by extension
Breast cancer simply might make these changes
We found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited 70% in the group that made these changes whereas only 9% in the comparison group, these differences were highly significant
even your sexual organs get more blood flow, so you increase sexual potency
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services showing that nicotine which constricts your arteries can cause a heart attack or a stroke, but it also causes impotence, half of guys who smoke or impotence, how sexy is that
And we're also about to publish the study, the first study showing you can change gene expression and men with prostate cancer
This is what's called a heat map, and the different colors and along the side on the right are different genes
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed
And in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease preventing genes, turning off the disease promoting genes
And so these these findings, I think are really very powerful that giving many people new hope and new choices and companies like Navigenex and DNA Direct and 23 and me that are giving your genetic profiles are getting some people a sense of gosh, well, what can I do about it? Well, our genes are not our fate
And if we make these changes, they're a predisposition, but if we make bigger changes and we might have made otherwise, we can actually change how our genes are expressed
Thank you
APPLAUSE
Well, I'm involved in other things besides physics
In fact, mostly now and other things
One thing is distant relationships among human languages
And the professional historical linguists in the US and in Western Europe, mostly try to stay away from many long-distance relationships
big groupings that go back a long time longer than the familiar families
They don't like that they think it's crank
I don't think it's crank
And there's some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, it's kind of a institute and in Moscow
And I would love to see where that leads
Does it really lead to a single ancestor, some 20, 25,000 years ago? And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor when there was presumably a competition among many languages? How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go? How many tens, how many tens of thousands of years does it go back? Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer that is? Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay of the caves in Western Europe in the orignation period, some 35,000 years ago or earlier
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a mountain language
So I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further
But that doesn't mean that all or many or most of today's like attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years or something of that kind
That's what we call a bottleneck
I'll put a bandison, may have been right
You may just know more about everything than anyone
So it's been an honor
Thank you, Mara
Go on
Thank you
Thank you
How does the news shape the way we see the world? Here's the world based on the way it looks based on landmass
And here's how news shapes what Americans see
This map shows the number of seconds that American networking cable news organizations dedicated to news stories by country in February of 2007, just one year ago
Now this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities
There was massive flooding in Indonesia
And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming
The US accounted for 79% of total news coverage
And when we take out the US and look at the remaining 21% we see a lot of Iraq, that's that big green thing there
little else, the combined coverage of Russia, China, and India, for example, reached just 1%
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story, here's how the world looked
What was that story? The death of Ananacol Smith
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC reports
And this cycle continues as we all know Brittany has loomed pretty large lately
So why don't we hear more about the world? One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half
Aside from one person ABC mini bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi, and Mumbai, there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America, places that are home to more than two billion people
The reality is, is that covering Brittany is cheaper
In this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news
Local TV news looms large and unfortunately only dedicates 12% of its coverage to international news
And what about the web? The most popular news sites don't do much better
Last year, Pew and Columbia J school analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google news as front page, and they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events
Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U
S
news creators is recycled stories from the APYR services and writers, and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it
So if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates, as well as less educated Americans, no less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago
And if you think that it's simply because we are not interested, you would be wrong
In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50%
The real question is this distorted world view what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world
I know we can do better and can we afford not to
Thank you
Thank you
I have given the slideshow that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times
I'm given a short slideshow this morning that I'm giving for the very first time
So, well, it's, I don't want to raise the bar
I'm actually trying to lower the bar because I've cobbled this together
to try to meet the challenge of this session
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that if religion really properly understood is not about belief, but about behavior
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism
How dare we be optimistic
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief
An intellectual posture, as Mahatma Gandhi famously has said, you must become the change you wish to see in the world
And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior
But the word behavior is also I think sometimes misunderstood in this context
I may be a big advocate of changing the light bulbs and buying hybrids and tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house and dug the geothermal wells and done all of that other stuff
But as important as it is to change the light bulbs, it's more important to change the laws
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives, we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part
In order to be optimistic about this, we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy
In order to solve the climate crisis, we have to solve the democracy crisis and we have one
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time
I was reminded of that recently by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at just staring at me as she walked past
She was in her 70s looked like she had a kind face
I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye
She was walking from the opposite direction also just staring at me
And so I said, how do you do? And she said, you know, if you died your hair black, you would look just like Al Gore
Many years ago when I was a young congressman, I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control, the nuclear arms race
And the military historians taught me during that quest that military conflicts are typically put into three categories
Local battles, regional or theater wars, and the rare but all important global world war, strategic conflicts
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources, a different approach, a different organizational model
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories
And most of what we think about our local environmental problems, air pollution, water pollution, hazardous waste dumps
But there aren't also regional environmental problems like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast from Western Europe to the Arctic, from the Midwest, out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico, and there are lots of those
But the climate crisis is the rare but all important global or strategic conflict
Everything is affected
And we have to organize our response appropriately
We need a worldwide global mobilization for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency, and a global transition to a low-carbon economy
We have work to do
And we can mobilize resources and political will
But the political will has to be mobilized in order to mobilize the resources
Let me show you these slides here
I thought I would start with the logo
What's missing here, of course, is the North Polar Ice Cap
Greenland remains
28 years ago, this is what the Polar Ice Cap, the North Polar Ice Cap looked like at the end of the summer at the Fall Equinox
This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory, this is what's happened in the last 28 years
To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record
Here's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers
The North Polarized cap is the same size geographically
It doesn't look that quite the same size, but it is exactly the same size As the United States minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona, the amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything used to the Mississippi
The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much
Comes back in the winter, but not as permanent ice as thin ice, vulnerable
The amount remaining could be completely gone and summer in as little as five years
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland
Already around the Arctic Circle, this is a famous village in Alaska
This is a town in Newfoundland
Antarctica, latest studies from NASA, the amount of moderate to severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California
There were the best of times over the worst of times
The most famous opening sentence in the English literature
I want to share briefly a tale of two planets
and Venus are exactly the same size
Earth's diameter is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size
They have exactly the same amount of carbon
But the difference is on Earth, most of the carbon has been leached over time out of the atmosphere deposited in the ground as coal, oil, natural gas, et cetera
On Venus, most of it is in the atmosphere
The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average on Venus, it's 855
This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible when putting it into the atmosphere
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the sun
It's three times hotter than Mercury, which is right next to the sun
Now, briefly, here's an image you've seen as one of the only old images, but I show it because I want briefly give you CSI climate
The global scientific community says, man-made global warming pollution put into the atmosphere, thickening this is trapping more of the outgoing infrared
You all know that
At the last IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say, how certain are you, they wanted to answer that 99%
The Chinese objected and so the compromise was more than 90%
Now, the skeptics say, oh, wait a minute, this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun
If that were true, the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere
If it's more coming in, if it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here
Here is the lower atmosphere
Here is the stratosphere
Now, here's the good news
68% of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming
69% believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way
There has been progress, but here is the key
When given a list of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom, what is missing is a sense of urgency
If you agree with the factual analysis, but you don't feel the sense of urgency, where does that leave you? Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I had in conjunction with the current who did this pro bono, did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this
This was the winner
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! In BC, I'll show all of the networks here, the top journals for NBC as 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates, two of them were about the climate crisis
ABC, 844 questions, two of the climate crisis
Fox, two, CNN, two, CBS, zero
From laughs to tear, This is one of the old tobacco commercials
So here is what we're doing
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries, and us
But it's not just the developed nations
The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace
And actually, their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent of where we were in 1965, and they're catching up very dramatically
The total concentrations by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985
If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture, we would still have this crisis
But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis
This is in Bolivia over 20, over 30 years
This is peak fishing in the few seconds
the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s
We have to stop this
And the good news is that we can
We have the technologies
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this
The struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions all has a single very simple solution
He was a what's the solution? Here it is
Put a price on carbon
We need a CO2 tax revenue neutral to replace to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck, and some things have changed since the 19th century
In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solution to the climate crisis, plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted if we do not solve the climate crisis
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries
This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe
of this was from Nature Magazine
These are concentrating solar renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called super grid to supply all of the electrical power to Europe largely from developing countries
High voltage DC currents
This is not pie in the sky
This can be done
We need to do it for our own economy
the latest figures show that the old model is not working
There are a lot of great investments that you can make
If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil, then you have a portfolio that is crammed with subprime carbon assets
And it is based on an old model
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse
Developing tar sands and coal-shale is the equivalent
Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense
I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there
But geothermal concentrating, solar, advanced photovoltaics, efficiency, and conservation
You've seen this slide before, but there's a change
The only two countries that didn't ratify now there's only one
Australia had an election and there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there
And we trained 250 people to give the slideshow in every town and village and city in Australia
A lot of other things contributed to it, but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto
And he has
Now, they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had
This is Lake Lanera
My friend Heidi Cohen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names, we would call the one in the South East now Katrina
and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta
We can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture
Here's more good news
The city's supporting Kyoto in the US eruptus 780, and I thought I saw one go by there just to localize this, which is good news
Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine
What we need is another hero generation
We, those of us who were alive in the United States of America today especially, but also the rest of the world
Have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice
Just as Jill Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through
We now have a culture of distraction, but we have a planetary emergency
And we have to find a way to create in the generation of those alive today a sense of generational mission
I wish I could find the words to convey this
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet
that ended slavery and that gave women the right to vote
We can do this
Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq war, we could be well on the way to solving this challenge
We have the capacity to do it
One final point
I'm optimistic because I believe we have the capacity at moments of great challenge to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying, Oh, this is so terrible
What a burden we have
I would like to ask you to reframe that
How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts that has a challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do
I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which a thousand years from now, Philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying they were the ones that founded within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future
Let's do that
Thank you very much
So, for so many people at TED, there is deep pain that, basically, Basically a design issue, at the end of the day a design issue on a voting form, one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true
That hurts
You have no idea
When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now, I mean, are you excited by their plans on global warming? Oh, my God
I'm not surprised at it
The answer to the question is hard for me because, on the one hand, I think that we should feel really great about the fact fact that the Republican nominee, certain nominee, John McCain, and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination, all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis
All three have offered leadership and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration
And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals
But the campaign dialogue, as illustrated by the questions, that was put together by the League of Conservation voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions
by the way, the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label, clean coal
Have you, as anybody noticed that? Every single debate's been sponsored by clean coal now, even lower emissions
The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed
So they're saying the right things, and they may, whichever of them is elected, may do the right thing
But let me tell you, when I came back from Kyoto in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness that we'd gotten that breakthrough there, and then confronted the United States Senate, only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm, to ratify that treaty
Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization, CO2CX, hailing breath of our civilization literally
And now we've mechanized that process, changing that pattern requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past
So that's why I began by saying, be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen, to man, change the eyeballs, but change the laws, change the global treaties
We have to speak up, we have to solve this democracy, this, this, this, we have a sclerosis in our democracy
And we have to change that, use the internet, go on the internet, connect with people, become very active as citizens
Have a more at Torima
We shouldn't have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren't able to capture and store CO2
Which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources
Now nobody is talking on that scale, but I do believe that between now and November, it is possible
This alliance for climate protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign
Grassroots, mobilization, television ads, internet ads, radio, newspaper with partnerships with everybody from the girls scouts to the hunters and fishermen
We need help
We need help
And in terms of your own personal role going forward, is that something more that you would like to be doing? I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question
What can I do? But Mr
Fuller wants to wrote, if the future of all human civilization depended on me, what would I do? How would I be? It does depend on all of us, but again, not just with the light bulbs
We, most of us here, are Americans
We have a democracy
We can change things, but we have to actively change
What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness
And that's hard to create
But it is coming
There's an old African proverb that some of you know that says, if you want to go go quickly, go alone
If you want to go far, go together
We have to go far quickly
So we have to have a change in consciousness, a change in commitment, a new sense of urgency, a new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge
I'll go, thank you so much for coming to Ted
Thank you very much, Bill
Thank you
Thank you
I'm working with motion and animation and also I'm an old DJ and a musician
So music videos is something that I always found interesting
But they always seem to be so reactive
So I was thinking, can you remove the us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it? So with two designers, Paul Gengrystina at my office, we took a track
Many of you probably know it, it's about 25 years old and it's David Baron and Brian you know, and we did this little animation, and I think that it's maybe interesting also that it deals with two problematic issues which is rising waters and religion
This is so good, strike! Keep going, no way! You want more of it than that! That's the rule! You're the jack! I believe it's all! No one can give me! I've been my cheery doctor, we can be here before! He come and run, never strike! Come and move ahead and do this
Understand that some body, they can't really show
And the sun began to move up and understand it this
Come on, man! Come on, give us that! Oh, I need more! Oh, I need more! Oh, I need more! Get the first one! I need more! Get the first one! I need the right one! Get the first one! Get the first one! Oh, I need more! I need more! So, they get tired, it was so dark and red, I think it's rare and tired
And then you went and knocked a hole made it up
So, only around that mistake
Oh, is it? Jackson, me, Mama, Sam, but this family later as we were far from a very tight
I think we're good
You know what I said? Oh, yes
Come on in
I'm so proud of you It was tough, it was tough And we don't need your parent's time Oh, I mean love
Good morning
Let's look for a minute as the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci
We're all familiar with his fantastic work, his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings
But we do not know his face
Thousands of books have been written about him, but there's controversy, and it remains about his looks
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many other historians
So what do you think? Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it? Let's find out
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him
He drew people anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything
But no faces
I find that hard to believe
His contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here
Our fuss of three quarters, so surely a passion at drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits sometimes a time
So let's try to find them
I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us
So I looked at all of his drawings more than 700 and looked for male portraits
There are about 120 you see them here
which ones of these could be self-portraits? Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw on fast or three quarters, so we can eliminate all the profiles
It also has to be sufficient to detail, so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized
And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man, so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures
And look what happens, only three candidates remain that fit the bill
And here they are
Yes indeed, the old man is there
As is this famous pandrome of the home of the truvianas
And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted the musician
And before we go into these faces, I should explain why I have some right to talk about them
I've made more than 1100 portraits myself for newspapers over the course of 30 years
Sorry, 30 is only
But there are 1100
And very few artists have drawn so many faces
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces
OK
Now let's look at these three portraits and hold on to your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead
The horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips, and the small well-developed chin
I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that
There was no reason why these portraits should look alike
all we did was look for a portrait that had the characteristics of a self-portrait and look they do are very similar
Now, are they made in the right order? The young man should be made first and as you see it from the years that they were created, it is in the case, they are made in the right order
What was the age of Leonardoette the time? Does that fit? Yes, it does
He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made
So we have three pictures, potentially, of the same person, of the same age as Leonardoette the time
How do we know it's him and not someone else? Well, we need a reference
And here's the only picture of the unaltered that's widely accepted
It's a set you'll made by Virocchio of David for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15
And if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again
The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces
Ladies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published
It's only proper that you hear it, Ted, hear and see it first
The icon of icons finally has a face
Here he is
They are not a Davinci
APPLAUSE
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder schizophrenia
And as a sister and later as a scientist, I wanted to understand why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true
What is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses and I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I was working in the lab of Dr
Francine Benus in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry
In the lab, we were asking the question, what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control? As compared with the brains of individuals' diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizophrenia, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder
So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitary of the brain, which cells are communicating with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities of those chemicals
So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings and on the weekend, I traveled as an advocate for Nalami, the National Alliance on Mental Illness
But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own
A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain
And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information
On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of my life
I essentially became an infant and a woman's body
If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate for one another
And I have brought for you a real human brain
Yes
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
So this is a real human brain
This is the front of the brain, the back of the brain with a spinal cord hanging down
And this is how it would be positioned inside of my head
When you look at the brain, it's obvious that the two cerebral core disease are completely separate from one another
For those of you who understand computers, are right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor
While our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor, the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus colosum, which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers
But other than that, the two hemispheres are completely separate
Because they process information differently, each of our hemispheres think about different things
They care about different things
And dare I say, they have very different personalities
Excuse me
Thank you
It's been a joy
Oh, that was good
Oh, that was good
Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment
It's all about right here right now
Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures, and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies
Information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems, and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like, and what it sounds like
I am an energy bean connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere
We are energy beans connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family
And right here, right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place
And in this moment we are perfect, we are whole, and we are beautiful
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere, is a very different place
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically
Our left hemisphere is all about the past, and it's all about the future
Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details, details, and more details about those details
It then categorizes and organizes all that information, associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future all of our possibilities
And our left hemisphere thinks in language
It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world
It's that little voice that says to me, hey, you got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home
I need them in the morning
It's that calculating intelligence that knows that reminds me when I have to do my laundry
But perhaps most important, it's that little voice that says to me, I am
I am
And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me, I am
I become separate
I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you
And this is a portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke
On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye
And it was the kind of pain, the caustic pain that you get when you buy them to ice cream, and it just gripped me, and then it released me, and then it just gripped me, and then it released me
And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, OK, I'll just start my normal routine
So I got up and I jumped on to my cardiac lighter, which is a full body full exercise machine
And I'm jamming away on this thing
And I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar
And I thought that's very peculiar
And I looked down at my body
And I thought, whoa, I don't know
Weird, looking thing
And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience
There was already peculiar and my headache was just getting worse, so I get off the machine
And I'm walking across my living room floor and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down
And every step is very rigid and very deliberate
There's no fluidity to my pace
And there's this constriction in my area of perception
So I'm just focused on internal systems
And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower
And I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body
I heard a little voice saying, okay, you muscles, you got to contract, and you muscles you relax
And now I lost my balance, and I'm propped up against the wall
And I looked down at my arm, and I realized that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body
I can't define where I begin and where I end
Because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall, And all I could detect was this energy, energy
And I'm asking myself, what is wrong with me? What is going on? And in that moment, my brain chatter, my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent
Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button, total silence
And at first, I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind, but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me
And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive, I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there
And then all of a sudden, my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me, hey, we have a problem
We got a problem
We got to get some help, and I'm going, oh, I got a problem
I got a problem
So I said, okay, okay, I got a problem, but then I immediately drifted right back out into consciousness and I affectionately refer to this space as law-law land
But it was beautiful there
Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world
So here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to my job, it was gone
And I felt lighter in my body
Imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone
And I felt this sense of peacefulness
And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage
Oh, I felt euphoria
Euphoria
It was beautiful there
And then again, my left hemisphere comes online
And it says, hey, you've got to pay attention
We've got to get help and I'm thinking I got to get help
I got to focus
So I get out of the shower and I'm mechanically dressed
So I'm walking around my apartment
And I'm thinking I got to get to work
I got to get to work
Can I drive? Can I drive? And in that moment, my ride arm went totally paralyzed by my side
Then I realized, oh my gosh, I'm having a stroke
I'm having a stroke
And then the next thing my brain says to me is, wow, this is so cool
This is so cool
How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out? And then it crosses my mind
But I'm a very busy woman
I have time for a stroke
It's like, OK, I can't stop the strokes from happening
So I'll do this for a week or two, and then I'll get back to my routine
OK, so I got to call help
I got to call work
I could remember the number of works
So I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number on it
So I go into my business room
I pull out a three inch stack of business cards
And I'm looking at the card on top
And even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye, what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this was my card and not because all I could see were pixels
And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and I just couldn't tell
And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity
And in that moment, I would be able to reattach to normal reality
And I could tell that's not the card, that's not the card, that's not the card
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards
In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere
I do not understand numbers
I do not understand a telephone, but it's the only plan I have
So I take the phone pad, and I put it right here, I take the business card, I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the foam pad
But then I would drift back out into La Land and not remember if when I come back if I'd already dialed those numbers
So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality, I'd be able to tell
Yes, I've already dialed that number
Eventually, the whole number gets dialed, and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone, and he says to me, Woo, woo, woo
And I think that myself, oh my gosh, he sounds like a goldberry dreamer
And so I say to him, clear in my mind, I say to him, this is Jill, I need help
And what comes out of my voice is, woo, woo
They think, oh my gosh, I sound like a goldberry dreamer
So I couldn't know, I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried
So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help
And a little while later, I'm writing in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Mass General Hospital
And I curl up into a little fetal ball
And just like a balloon with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon
I just felt my energy lift and just, I felt my spirit surrender
And in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life, and either the doctor's rescue my body and give me a second chance a life, or this was perhaps my moment of transition
When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover that I was still alive
When I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my life
My mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality
Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems, felt like purpane
Light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space
I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great way of gliding through a sea of silent euphoria
Nirvana
I found Nirvana
I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body
But then I realized, but I'm still alive
I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana
And if I have found Nirvana, and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana
And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time
and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this piece
And then I realized, what a tremendous gift this experience could be
What a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives
And it motivated me to recover
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers
Here I am with my mama, who's a true angel in my life
It took me eight years to completely recover
So who are we? We are the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds
And we have the power to choose moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world
Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we are
I am the life force power of the universe
the life force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form
And one with all that is
Or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become a single individual, a solid separate from the flow, separate from you
I am Dr
Jill Bolte Taylor, intellectual, neuroanatomest
These are the we inside of me, which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace secretary of our right hemispheres
The more peace we will project into the world And the more peaceful our planet will be
And I thought that was an idea we're spreading

I'm here to enlist you and helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done
Here's the old story
We've already heard a little bit about it
Biology is war in which only the fiercest survive
This is, and nations succeed only by defeating, destroying, and dominating competition
Politics is about your side winning at all costs
But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge
It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines in which cooperation, collective action, and complex interdependencies play a more important role and the central, but not all important role of competition and survival of the fittest
just a little bit to make room
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media, and collective action when I wrote smart mobs
And I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it
In fact, if you look back, human communication media and And the ways in which we organize socially have been co-volving for quite a long time
Humans have lived for much, much longer than approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups
Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering food
The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive
But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game
And we don't know exactly how they did this, although they must have solved some collective action problems
It only makes sense that you can't hunt master-dons while you're fighting with the other groups
And again, we have no way of knowing, but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged
More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted
So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forums
Did the people who ate that mass did on me owe something to the hunters and their families? And if so, how do they make arrangements? Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved
Of course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations, the first cities, built of mud and brick, the first empires
And it was the administrators of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks
Marks on clay in that time
Not too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented
And this powerful tool was really reserved for thousands of years for the elite administrators who kept track of accounts for the empires
And then another communication technology enabled new media
The printing press came along, and within decades, millions of people became literate
And from literate populations, new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge, religion, and politics
We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation, constitutional democracies, possible where they had not been possible before
Not created by the printing press, but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy
And again, new forms of wealth emerged
Now commerce is ancient
Markets are as old as the crossroads
But capitalism, as we know, it is only a few hundred years old, enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies, such as the joint stock ownership company, shared liability insurance, double entry bookkeeping
Now, of course, the enabling technologies are based on the internet
And in many, too many era, every desktop is now a printing press, a broadcasting station, a community, or a marketplace
Evolution is speeding up
More recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops
And very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant portion if not the majority of the human race
around holding, carrying, or wearing, supercomputers, linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today
Now when I started looking into collective action, the considerable literature on it, based on what sociologists call social dilemmas, and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them, the prisoners dilemma and the tragedy, the comments
Now when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly, he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoners dilemma
So I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly
You have more questions about it
Ask Kevin Kelly later
The prisoners dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war, two players who couldn't trust each other
Let me just say that every unssecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma
Person with the goods, person with the money, because they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange
Neither one wants to be the first one, or they're going to get the suckers pay off
But both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want
They can only agree
If they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an insurance game, they could proceed
20 years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question
If we're here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all? started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoners, dilemma strategies and discovered much to his surprise that a very, very simple strategy won
It won the first tournament and even after everyone knew it won, it won the second tournament
That's known as tip for Tath
Another economic game that may not be, as well known as the of prisoners dilemma is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions
Here's how the game's played
There are two players they've never played the game before, they will not play it again, they don't know each other, and they are in fact in separate rooms
player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split
50, 50, 90, 10, whatever that player wants to propose
The second player either accepts the split, both players are paid and the game is over or rejects the split
Neither player is paid and the game is over
Now, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because somebody you don't know in another room is going to get 99
Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students, a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50, 50
And although they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played the game before, proposals seem to innately know this, because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50, 50
Now, the interesting part comes in more recently, when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures, and discovered to their surprise that slash and burn agriculturalists in the Amazon, or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia, or it does in different cultures, each had radically different ideas of what is fair, which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness, that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions, whether we know that or not
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons, Garrett Harden used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s, used the example of a common grazing area in which each person, by simply maximizing their own flock, led to overgrazing in the depletion of the resource
You have the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably dispoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it
Now Eleanor Ostrom, a political scientist in 1990, asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask, which is, it really true that humans will always destroy all common
So she went out and looked at what data she could find
She looked at thousands of cases of human sharing watersheds, forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case, humans destroyed the commons that they depended on
But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoners dilemma
In fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be
They escape by creating institutions for collective action
And she discovered, I think, most interestingly, that among those institutions that worked, there were a number of common design principles
And those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work
I'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines
In biology, the notions of symbiosis, group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested to be sure
But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology
And again, our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned
Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor
In fact, people will act uponish cheaters even at a cost to themselves
And most recently, Nerophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters and economic gains show activity in the reward centers of their brain, which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together
Now, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms, commerce's ancient markets are very old, capitalism is fairly recent, socialism emerged as a reaction to that
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging
Jim Serowikki briefly mentioned, a book, I bankler's paper about open source, pointing to a new form of production, peer-to-peer, production
I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past new forms of cooperation, enable by new technologies, create new forms of wealth, we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones
Very briefly let's look at some businesses
IBM, as you know, HP son, some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons
Eli Lilly, and again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems
Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace, treats them as a network and trains them to produce better, even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors
Now, none of these companies are doing this out of altruism
They're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest
open-source production has shown us that world class software, like Linux and Mazzilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them
Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through ad-sense
Amazon has opened its application programming interface to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops
They're enriching others, not out of altruism, but as a way of enriching themselves
eBay solved the prisoners dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game
Instead of neither was contrasting each other, So we have to make sub-optable moves
It's you prove to me that you're trustworthy and I will cooperate
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years
We've seen that think cycle has enabled NGOs and developing countries to put up problems, to be solved by design students around the world
Including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now, it's a mechanism for rehydrating color of victims that's so simple to use that alliterates can be trained to use it
Bit torrent turns every downloader into an uploader, making a system more efficient, the more it is used
Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them to link together through the internet into super computing collectives that help solve the protein-folding problem for medical researchers that's folding at home, it's Stanford, to crack codes, to search for life in outer space
I don't think we know enough yet
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are
But I think we can begin to think about them
And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them, but think about self-interest
This is all about self-interest that adds up to more
In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that have been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy
In the US, in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world, citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mold devices and SMS
It's an Apollo project of cooperation possible a transdisciplinary study of cooperation
I believe that the payoff would be very big
I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines
And I am not saying that understanding cooperation It's going to cause us to be better people
And sometimes people cooperate to do bad things
But I will remind you that a few hundred years ago, people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits
Daycart said we need an entire new way of thinking
When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology, show that microorganisms cause disease suffering was alleviated
What forms of suffering could be alleviated? What forms of wealth could be created? If we knew a little bit more about cooperation, I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen
It's going to require effort
So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started
Thank you
Thank you
So I thought I would talk about death
It seemed to be the passion today
Actually, it's not about death
It's inevitable, terrible
But really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die
That's what I want to talk about
So Art Buckwall left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died saying, hi, I'm Art Buckwall, and I just died
And Mike, who I met at Gallapagos, which I won a TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace, where he's chronicling his journey through cancer
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook
In the last two years of his life, when you a sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement
And coding, coding specific incidents and held a mirror to my life
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore
Handrating is a disappearing art
I'm all for email in thinking while typing, but why give up all habits for new? Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives? There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him and trade all those years for one hug
But too late
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them
And the paper that touched his hand is in mine and I feel connected to him
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value, like I see, and not a financial one
A value for things with a personal touch
An autograph book, a soul searching letter
If a fraction of this powerful terrarians could be inspired by a beautiful paper, John, it'll be recycled one
And write a beautiful letter to someone they love
We actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes
So what do I plan to leave for my son? I collect autographed books and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them
And CD's too Tracy
I plan to publish my own notebook as I witness my father's body being swallowed by fire
I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote
I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I I'm committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book and leave that publish book for my son
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote my father's cremation
And those linguists please pardon the grammar because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years
I took it out for the first time to come here
Picture in a frame, Ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality forcing me to deal with being grown up
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong
But right now, I'm being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me
You're encouraging with spurs in my role pull of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again
Thank you
I am very, very happy to be a midist, some of the most relates I really disturbing my eyes and they are reflecting on my glasses
I am very happy and honored to be a midist, very, very innovative and intelligent people
I have listened to the three previous speakers and guess what happened? Every single thing I plan to say, they have said it here and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say
But there is a saying in my culture that if a bad leaves a tree without saying something, that bad is a young one
So I will, since I am not young and I'm very old, I still will say something
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment, because another conference is taking place in Berlin, it is the G8 summit
The G8 summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid, something akin to the Marshall Plan
Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan, one because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated
It's largest recipients who had German and France and was only 2
5% of the GDP and average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15% of its GDP, and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect
How the media covers Africa in the West and the consequences of that by displaying the the sphere, helplessness and hopelessness
The media is telling the truth about Africa and nothing but the truth
However, the media is not telling us the whole truth
Because the sphere, civil war, hunger and famine
Although their part and part of our African reality, they are not the only reality
And secondly, they are the smallest reality
Africa has shifted through nations
We have civil wars only in six countries, which means that the media are covering only six countries
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the way of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience
But the effect of that presentation is that it appeals to sympathy, it appeals to pity, it appeals to something called charity
And as a consequence, the Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is from the wrongly
The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair
What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry
We should delve away from anything as to those who are ill
We should do sand piscipping troops serve those who are facing a civil war
And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative
I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses
But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa
From a challenge of despair, despair, which is called poverty reduction, to a challenge of hope
We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is world's creation
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not a challenge of reducing poverty
it should be a challenge of creating wealth
Once we change those two things, if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction, you have the international cocktail of good intentions, moving on to the continent with what? Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry and piscophiles for those who are facing civil war
And in the process, none of these things because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes of Africa's fundamental problems
Sending somebody at school and giving them medicines ladies and gentlemen does not create wealth for them
Well, is a function of income and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job
Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa, our second challenge will be who are the wealth we get in agents in a society
They are entrepreneurs
And just as simple as all of us, they are always about 4% of the population, the 16% are imitators
So, but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship
So where should we be putting the money? We need to put money where it can productively grow
Support private investment in Africa
Both domestic and foreign
support, research institutions, because knowledge is an important part of world's creation
But what is the international aid the community doing at Africa today? They are throwing large sums of money for primary health, for primary education, for food relief
The entire content has been turned into a place of despair in need of charity
That is ungenital men
Can anyone of you tell me a neighbour, a friend, a relative that you know, who grew well, who became rich by receiving charity, by holding the begging bow and receiving arms, does anyone of you in the audience have that passion? Does anyone of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another? Well, since I'm not sick of the hand, it appears that what I'm stating is true
I can see Bono says he knows the country, which country is that? Thank you very much
But let me tell you this
External actors can only present you an opportunity
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity
Africa has received many opportunities, many of them we haven't benefited much, why? Because we lack the institutional framework and the policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations
I'll give you an example
And the cotton wire agreement, former, former known as the known convention, African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods due to free to the European Union market
My own country Uganda has a water to export 50,000 metric tons of sugar to the European Union market
We haven't exported one kilogram yet
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba
Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement, African countries that produce beef have brought us to export beef due to free to the European Union market
None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana, has ever made it squatter
So I want to add you today that the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and poor safer and poor and all forms of intervention need to support the evolution of the kind of institutions that create wealth, the kind of institutions that increase productivity
How do we begin to do that? And why is aid the bad instrument? Aid is the bad instrument
Why? Because all governments across the world need the money to survive
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping low and order
You have to pay the am and the police to show a low and order
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial, they need really to have the amic global opposition
The second thing you need to do is pay your political handguns or why should people support government, well, because it gives them good paying jobs
Oh, in the South African countries, an official opportunities to profit from corruption
The third is no government in the world with exception of a few like that of idiomine can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule
Men are countries in the digital, they need legitimacy
To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education, primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics
If the government's fiscal survival depends on needs having to raise money from its own people, such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion
It will sit with those who create wealth
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions That unnecessary, for them to expand the scale and scope of business, so that it can collect more tax revenues from them
The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the government in Africa
The productive margin in our government's such for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy
It lies with international donors
Rather than see it with Uganda, Rather than sit with Uganda non-sponuous, Ghanaian businessmen, South African, enter praising leaders, our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank
I can tell you, if any of you have 10 PhDs, you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry
Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand the business requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry
Governments in Africa have therefore been given and no opportunity by the international community to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank and then it is IMF the World Bank that tell them what the assistance need
In the process, with the African people have been said line from the policy making, policy re-intention and policy implementation process in our countries
We have limited input because he who pays the paper calls the tune
The IMF, the World Bank, and the Katera of Good Intention in the World has taken over our rights as citizens, and therefore what our governments are doing
Because they depend on aid is to listen to international creditors rather than the foreign citizens
But I want to put a caveat on my argument
And that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive
Some aid may have built a hospital, treated a hungry village, a rather fed a hungry village
It may have built a road, and that road may have served a very good road
The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick this isolated incidence of success, Generalize them, power billions and billions of dollars into them, and then spread them across the whole world, ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village, the skills, the practices, the norms and habits that allowed that small, the project succeed, like in Saudi village in Kenya, where Jeffree Sax is working, and therefore generalizes experience as the experience of everybody
Eight increases the resources available to governments
And that makes working in the government the most profitable thing you can have as a person in Africa sitting in the area
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state, especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa, aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group
Now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie
Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business
Governments are not changing it, why? because they don't need to talk to their own citizens, they talk to international donors
So the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government, and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid
I also want to say that it is important for us to not that over the last 50 years Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community, in form of technical assistance and financial aid and all other forms of aid
Between 1960 and 2003, our content received $600 billion of aid, and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa, where has all the aid gone? I want to use the example of my own country called Uganda, and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue 2
5 trillion shillings, expected for an 8
1 trillion
Uganda's current expenditure, by recurrent, what do I mean? Handed mouth, is 2
6 trillion
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110% of its own revenue? It's because they're somebody they're called for an aid, who contributes for it
But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments, but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure, the public administration which is largely patronage takes 609 billion
The military, 308, agriculture which employs 18% of poverty, street and citizens takes only 18 billion
Shared an industry takes 43 billion and let me show you what does public expenditure rather public administration expenditure in Uganda constitute
There you go
Seventor-competit ministers, 114 presidential advisors by the way, could never see the president except on television
And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this
And even there, it is him who advises them
We have eight or one units of local government
Each local government is organized like the Central government, a bureaucracy, a the community parliament and so many jobs for the political Hangar zone, they were 56 and when our president wanted to amend the Constitution and remove family myths, he had to create 25 new districts now, they're 81
300 and 33 members of parliament, you need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament, 134 commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies and semi-autonomous government bodies, all of which have directors and cars and and the final thing, this is at rest to Mr
Bono in his work, he may help us on this
A recent government of Uganda stood the found that there are three-sauld and four-wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health and the Quotals
Uganda has 96
1 sub-counties
Each of them with a dispensary nanofritch has an ambulance
So the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects while the poor die without ambulances and medicine
Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here, I was told that the principal of Ted Globo is that a good speech should be like a miniscuit
It should be short enough to arose interest, but long enough to cover the subject
I hope I have achieved it
Thank you very much
APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Thanks for your support
I really am honored to be here and as Chris said, it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa
My first introduction was at the Abjana Airport on us, sweaty, I've recorched, coast morning
I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Meade, giving away most everything that I owned and arrived with all the essentials and poetry, few clothes and of course a guitar, because I was going to save the world than I thought I would just start with the African continent
But literally within days of arriving, I was told in no uncertain terms by a number of West African women that Africans didn't want saving, thank you very much, least of all not by me
I was too young, unmarried, had no children, didn't really know Africa and besides my French was pitiful
So it was an incredibly painful time in my life
And yet, it really started to give him the humility to start listening
I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well
So I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda
And I met a group of who were warned in women who asked me in 1986 to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there
And I did, and we ended up naming it due to the number of men to go forward with enthusiasm
And while we were doing it, I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women and so maybe I should try to run a business too
And so I started looking around and I heard about a bakery that was run by 20 prostitutes
And being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group
And what I found was 20 unwaired mothers who were trying to survive
And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language and how the what we call people so often distances us from them and makes them little
I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business
That in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person who essentially spent $600 a month to keep these 20 women busy, making little crafts and baked goods, and living on 50 cents a day still in poverty
So I made a deal with women
I said, look, we get rid of the charity side and we run this as a business and I'll help you
They nervously agreed
I nervously started
And of course, things are always harder than you think they're going to be
First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team and we clearly aren't the a team here
So, let's, I'll did all this training
And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Niyama-Rombo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali with a bucket and I sold all these little donuts to people and I came back and I was like, you see? And the women said, you know, Jacqueline, who in Niyama-Rombo is not going to buy donuts out of an orange bucket from a Tala-American woman
And it's good for it
So I went the whole American way with competitions, team, and individual, completely felt
But over time, the women learned to sell on their own way
And they started listening to the marketplace
And they came back with ideas for cassovachhips and banana chips and sorghum bread
And before you knew it, we had cornered the key godly market
And the women were earning three to four times the national average
And when that confidence surge, I thought, well, it's time to create a real bakery
So let's paint it
Women said that's a really great idea
And my soul of what color do you want to paint it? And they said, well, you choose
And I said, no, no, I'm learning to listen
You choose
It's your bakery, your street, your country, not mine
They wouldn't give me an answer
So one week, two weeks, three weeks went by
And finally, I said, well, how about blue? And they said, blue, blue, blue, blue, let's do a blue
So I went to the store
I brought go down to the Recalcitrant one of all
And then we bought all this paint and fabric to make curtains
And, um, painting day, we all gathered in Yamurambo and the idea was we would paint it white with blue is trimmed like a little French bakery, but that was clearly not as satisfying as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky
So blue, blue, everything became blue
The walls were blue, the windows were blue, the sidewalk out front was painted blue and, um, a wreath of Franklin was shouting RESP, ECT, the women's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paint brushes, but it was there day and at the end of it we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done and I said it is so beautiful and the women said it really is and I said I think the color is perfect and they all nodded their head except for a go-dance and I said what and she said nothing and I said what and she said well it is pretty but you know our color really it is green and And I learned then that listening isn't just about patience, but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long, it's really hard to say what you mean
And mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do you don't really think they want to know the truth
And so that I learned that listening is not only about waiting, but it's also learning how better to ask questions
And so I lived in Kigalit for about two and a half years doing these two things and it was an extraordinary time in my life and it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today and certainly in the work that I do
The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth
As Elena said, when people gain income they gain choice and that is fundamental to dignity
But as human beings we also want to see each other and we want to be heard by each other
should never forget that
The second is that traditional poverty and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty
I think Andrew, pretty well covered that
So I will move to the third point, which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty
Yes, we ran this as a business
But someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training and the management support, the strategic advice, and maybe most important and I'm all the access to new context networks and new markets
And so on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy
And on a macro level, some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized
But having had a father with heart disease and realizing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten and having a good friend step in to help
I really believe that all people deserve access to health and prices they can afford
I think the market can help us figure that out, but there's got to be a charitable component or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in
And so it was really those lessons that made me decide to build acumen fun about six years ago
It's a nonprofit venture capital fund for the poor, few oxymorons in one sentence
It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations, and And then we turn around and we invest equity and loans and both for profit and nonprofit entities that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water to low income people in South Asia and Africa so that they can make their own choices
We've invested about $20 million in 20 different enterprises and have, in so doing created nearly 20,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise were not able to afford them
I want to tell you two stories, both of them are in Africa
Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service and who really know the markets, both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise
And both of them, because they are manufacturers, create jobs directly and create incomes indirectly because they are in the malaria sector
And Africa loses about $13 billion a year because of malaria
So as people get healthier, they also get wealthier
The first one is called the Vance Bio-Extracts Limited
It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur in Patrick Henry and his three colleagues
These are old-hand farmers who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in Kenya over the last 30 years
Now this plant is an art of music plant
It's the basic component for art of listening, which is the best known treatment from malaria
It's indigenous to China and the far east
But given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa, Patrick and his colleague said, let's bring it here, because it's a high-value ad product
The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with Mays
And so using patient capital, many that they could raise early on that actually got below market returns and was willing to go to Longhall and be combined with management assistance, strategic assistance
They've now created the company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers
That's about 50,000 people affected
And I think some of you may have visited
These farmers are helped by Kickstarter and technosurf who helped them become more self-sufficient
They buy it, they dry it, and they bring it to this factory, which purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis, who was real interest in getting the powder so that they can make co-artum
I can inspire working with Abe for the past year, year and a half
Both on looking at a new business plan, what does expansion look like, helping with management and support, and helping to do term shifts and raise capital
And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so, because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world quality level needed to make Quartam
and they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history
And we called all of the social investors we know
Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa and understand the importance of agriculture
And they even helped the farmers
And even when we explain that, if Abe goes away, all those 700 jobs go away, too
We sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused
So Aku and Maid not won, but two bridge loans, and the good news is they did indeed meet world quality classification
And are now in the final stages of closing at $20 million around to move it to the next level
And I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa
This is Samoli as a farmer
He was actually living in the Kibara slums when his father called to him and told him about art of media and the value at potential
So we move back to the farm and long straight short, they now have seven acres under cultivation
Samiles Kizzer and private school, and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into our music production, dignity being more important than wealth
The next one, many of you know, I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago, and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing, which is one of the great real companies and East Africa
It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise
And this is really a story about a public-private solution that has really worked
It started in Japan
So, Metomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticides
So, you could create a bednet, malaria bednet that was last five years and not need to be redepped
You could alter the vector
But like Artemisia, it had been produced only in East Asia
And as part of its social responsibility, Simeo Thomas said, why don't we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa for Africans? Unicef came forward and said, we'll buy most of the nets, and then we'll give them away as part of the global funds and the UN's commitment to pregnant women and children for free
Akiman came in with the patient capital, and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in Africa
And, next on, provided the initial reason
Well, in looking around that for entrepreneurs, there was none better that we could find honor than a new Shah and a design manufacturing company
It's a 40-year-old company
It understands manufacturing
It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania and continued for flourish
She had about 1,000 employees when we first found it
And so, unnosed took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malaria
And long story short again, they've been so successful in our first year
The first net went off the line in October of 2003
We thought the hitting it out of the box number was 150,000 nets a year
This year they are now producing 8 million nets a year and they employ 5,000 people 90% of whom are women mostly on skilts
They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo
and so from an enterprise perspective for Africa and from a public health perspective, these are real successes
But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty because it's not long-term sustainable
It's a company with one big customer
And if Avian Flu hits her for any other reason, the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses
And so, a news and an argument have been talking about testing the private sector because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that looking at country like Tanzania 80% of the population makes less than $2 a day
It costs at manufacturing point $6 to produce these
It costs the establishment another $6 to distribute it
So the market price in a free market would be about $12 per net
Most people can't afford that
So let's give it away free
And we said, well, there's another option
Let's use the market as the best listening device we have
and understand that what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice we can start building local distribution, and actually it can cost the public sector much less
And so we came in with the second round of patient capital to a desired, alone as well as a grant so that it is that it could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace
And found a number of things, one that people will play different prices, but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it
And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don't like
And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work
But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital, we've now found that it costs about $1 in the private sector to distribute and a dollar to buy the net
So then from a policy perspective when you start with the market, we have a choice
We can continue going along at $12 a net
the customer pay is zero
Or we could at least experiment with some of it to charge one dollar in that, cost the public sector and other six dollars in that
Give the people the dignity of choice and have a distribution system that might over time start sustaining itself
We've got to start having conversations like this and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market but also to bring other people to the table around it
Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother Stella
She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines
She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor
Didn't have very much education
She moved to the United States where she met my grandfather who was a cement hauler
And they had nine children, three of them died as babies
My grandmother had to break your locuses and she worked in a sewing machine shop making shirts for about 10 cents an hour She like some of the women I see at a dessert Worked hard every day understood what suffering was had a deep faith in God loved her children and would never have accepted a handout But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace and She lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education
Her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams
I look around at my siblings and my cousins and I said there are a lot of us
And I see teachers and musicians
Head fund managers, designers, one sister who makes other people's wishes come true
And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers, and I think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day, is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility, and that they also can believe and get access to services so that their children too can live those lives of great purpose
shouldn't be that difficult
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse, try to assumptions, get out of our ideological boxes
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success
It takes opening your arms both wide and expecting very little love and return, but demanding accountability
and bringing accountability to the table as well
And most of all, most of all, it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience, whether we are rich or poor, African or non-Paper, can local or diaspora left or right to really start listening to each other
Thank you
Thank you
Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute to what's around a science in Africa
The question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadership
Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders
And it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent
I want to tell you some stories that explain my view
We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday
And the American friend of mine this year volunteers in Erson Ghana
And in the period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that had taken me over a decade to reach
She was involved in surgeries where they lost power of the hospital
Emergency generators did not start
There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle, pitch black
Patients cut open twice
The first time it was a sea section
Thankfully, baby was out
Mother and child survived
The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia and aesthetic where-suff, patient feels pain
He's crying
He's screaming
He's praying
pitch black Not a candle, not a flashlight
And that hospital could have afforded flashlight
It could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't
And it happened twice
Another time she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had
And so three months later, just before she returns to the United States, nurses in a crowd go and strike and her recommendation is, take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again
again, start all up again
Now, what does this have to do with leadership? You see, the faults of the Ministry of Education of Health, the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses, they are among just 5% of their peers who get an education after secondary school
They are the elite
There are leaders, their decisions, their actions matter
And when they fail, a nation literally suffers
So when I speak of leadership, I'm not talking about just political leaders
We've heard a lot about that
I'm talking about the elite
Those who've been trained, who's job it is to be the guardians of their society
The lawyers, the judges, the police men, the doctors, the engineers, the civil servants
Those are the leaders and we need to train them right
Now my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occurred when I was 16 years old
We had just had a military coup and soldiers were pervasive in our society
They were pervasive presence
And one day I go to the airport to meet my father, and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building, I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons
And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment
Why? because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds, no signs of this effect
Now I was 16
I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill
I was especially concerned of what the girls, girls, my think
And so I started to argue with these men
It's a little reckless now, 16
I got lucky
Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament because of his uniform, they speak to him differently, they explain to him that they're just following orders
So he takes her radio, tops of their boss, and gets us all released
What lessons would you take from an experience like this? Several for me, leadership matters
Those men were following the orders of a superior officer
I learned something about courage
It was important not to look at those guns
And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls
So a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education
It was a breath of fresh air
You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana
They wanted us to think critically
They wanted us to be analytical
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues
In my economics classes, I got high marks on my understanding of basic economics
But I learned something more profound than that, which is that the leaders, the managers of Ghana's economy were making breathtakingly bat decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse
And so here was this lesson again, leadership matters
It matters a great deal
But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me
I had an inkling
But I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation
And I was part of this team, this thinking, learning team
Whose job it was to design an implement new software, the creative value in the world
And it was brilliant to be part of this team
It was brilliant
And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore, this transformation
The ability to confront problems, complex problems, and to design solutions for those problems, the ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual
And I was part of that
Now while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana
But by the way, it's continued to the gap as wide since I left
Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred
I mean, there's the people there who are so hard working, persistent, creative, empowered
But there are also some external factors, free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure
These things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leaders
And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously
Somebody trained them to do the work that they do
Now while that was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened
I became a parent
And for the first time Africa mattered more to me than ever before
because I realized that the state of the African continent would matter to my children and their children, that the state of the world, the state of the world, depends on what's happening to Africa, as far as my kids would be concerned
And at this time, when I was going through what I called my in the pre-made life crisis
Africa was a mess, so Malia had disintegrated into Anarchy
Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war
And it seemed to me that that was a wrong direction
And I needed to be back helping
I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids in the upper middle class neighborhood and feel good about it
This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in
So I decided to get engaged and the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and Really try to understand what the real issues were and Three things kept coming up for every problem corruption We can situations and the people who run them the leaders Now I was a little scared because when you see those three problems, they seem really hard to deal with
And they might say, look, don't even try
But for me, I asked the question, well, where are these leaders coming from? What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical? Or unable to solve problems? So I went to look at what was happening in education system, I mean it's the same, learning by road from primary school through graduate school
Very little emphasis on ethics and the average, the typical graduate from a university in Ghana has a strongest sense of entitlement than the sense of responsibility
This is wrong
So I decided to engage this particular problem
Because it seems to me that every society must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders
And Ghana was not paying enough attention, and this is true across the Haryna Africa, actually
So this is what I'm doing
I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa
I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country
I think it would make a huge difference
And what a Sheshi university is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders, We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity who have the ability to confront the complex problems to ask the right questions and come up with workable solutions
I'll admit that there are times when it seems like mission impossible
But we must believe that these kids are smart, that if we involve them in their education, If we have them discuss the real issues that they confront that are also society confronts and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world that magic will happen
Now a month into this project would just start at classes and a month into it I come to the office and I have this email from one of our students and it said very simply I am thinking now and he signs off thank you
It's such a simple statement but I was moved almost to tears because I understood who was happening to this young man
And it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way
I am thinking now
This year we challenged our students to craft an on-a-code for themselves
It's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now of all that they should have an on-a-code and if so, what it should look like
One of the students asked the question that just warned my heart, can we create a perfect society? Her understanding that a student crafted on-a-code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible
Now, we cannot achieve perfection, but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence
I don't know ultimately what they will do, I don't know what they will decide to have this on a code, but the conversation that they're having now about what their good society should look like, what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing
My out of time? Okay
Now, I just want to leave that slide up, because it's important that we think about it
I'm very excited about the fact that every student to the Sheshi University does community service before they graduate, that for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience
These young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership, the real privilege of leadership, which is, after all, to serve humanity
I am even more thrilled by the fact that last year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government
It's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university
It says a lot about her
It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus
It says a lot about her peers who elected her
She won with 75% of the vote
And it gives me a lot of hope
It turns out the corporate West Africa also appreciates what's happening with our students
We've graduated two class of students today, and every single one of them has been placed
And we're getting great reports back from corporate Ghana, from corporate West Africa
And the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic
You know, that passion for what they're doing, the persistence, the ability to deal with ambiguity, their ability to tackle problems they haven't seen before
This is good because you know, over the past five years, it's been times when I felt this is mission impossible
And it's just wonderful to see so these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right
I think the current and future leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major innocence on the continent
It's an incredible opportunity
There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world
I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with the march of democracy and free markets across the continent
We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation
It will depend on inspired leadership and it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference
Thank you, God bless
Thank you
Thank you
Good to see you
Thanks
So, we've got a picture, I think
Where is this? This is my home
This is where I live
Where? In Manau, it's in Kasung
Yeah, Manau
Okay
Now, you're 19 now? Yeah, I'm meant to need it now
Five years ago, you had an idea
What was that? I want to medeow in the mirror
When you? Yeah
And so, what about for lighting and stuff? Yeah
So what did you do? How did you realize that? After I drove out from school, I went to live, and I read a book titled Using Anage
And I get information about doing the mirror
And I try and I am medeow
So, so
So you copied, you exactly copied the design in the book
I know
I just, what happened? In fact, a design of the wind, that it was in the book
It had four, three plates and mine had four plates
the book had three years had four
And you made it out of what? I made four prints just because I want to increase power
Okay, you tested three and found that four worked better? Yeah, I just
And what did you make the windmill out of? What did materials did you use? I use a basketball frame and a pooler and a plastic pipe
Why didn't pose? We have a picture of the next slide
Yeah
Is that what they're in to me? And so, and that when it worked, when they wind bros, it's produced and generates how much electricity, fuel for what? And so that lit a light for the house, how many lights? Four, babbed and two radios
Wow, yeah
And so
Next slide
So who's that? This is my parents
What in their idea? Oh, my, my
So what do they make of it? You were 14, 15 at the time
What do they make of this? They're impressed? Yeah
And so what's your, what are you going to do with this? What do you, I mean, do you want to build another one? Yeah, I want to build another one
To pump water and a great irrigation for crops
So this one would have to be bigger
Yeah
How big? I think, rule, produce more than 20, the votes
So that would produce irrigation for the entire village? Yeah
Wow
And so you're talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize the stream
Yeah, they can help me with my videos
And as you think of your life going forward, your 19 now, do you picture continuing with this stream of working in energy? Yeah
I'm still thinking to work on an energy
Wow
William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference
Thank you so much for coming
Thank you
Thank you
William
Thank you
Thank you very much Chris
Everybody who came up here said they were scared
I don't know if I'm scared, but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this and I don't have any smart technology But you to look at their no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me
What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa
Already this morning there were some illusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time
The Africa of HIV AIDS, the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict, and the Africa of disasters
Well, it is true that those things are going on
There's an Africa that you don't hear about very much
And sometimes, I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why
This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to
This is the Africa of opportunity
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this
That's what I want to talk about today
And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa
On 15th of September 2005, Mr
Deppria La Messega, a governor of one of the oil-risk rich states of Nigeria was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police, an evisit to London
He was arrested because there were transfers of $8 million that went into some domenta accounts that belonged to him and his family
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the economic and financial crimes commission of Nigeria led by one of our most able and courageous people, Mr
Nuhuribad
A Lamez Saga was arranged in London due to some slip-offs
He managed to escape dressed as a woman
And ran from London back to Nigeria, where, according to a constitution, those in office, as governor's president, as many countries have immunity and cannot be prosecuted
But what happened? People were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office
Today, alums as we call him for short, is in jail
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good and not taken out To places where they'll benefit just a few of their lead and Therefore when you hear about the corrupt Africa Corruption all the time I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries and that some successes are emerging does it mean the problem is over the answer is no
There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there
And that successes are being chocked up on this very important fight
So when you hear about corruption, don't just feel that nothing is being done about this, that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption
That is not the case
There's a will to fight and in many countries that fight is ongoing and is being won
is being won
In others, like mine, where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria, the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on
The results are showing independent monitoring by the well-bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption and governance is improving a study by the economic commission for Africa showed a clad trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries
And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance
That is that people talk about corruption, corruption, all the time when they talk about it, you immediately think about Africa
That's the image African countries
But let me say this, if Alan was able to export $8 million into an account in London
If the other people who are taking money estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies, sitting abroad in the developed countries, if they able to do this, what is that? Is that not corruption? And this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted? So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think about what is happening On the other side of the globe, where the money is going, and what can be done to stop it? And working an initiative now, along with a well bank on asset recovery, trying to do what we can to get the money that have been taken up broad, developing countries' money to get that sent back
Because if we can get the $20 billion that's sitting out there back, it may do far more for some of these countries than all the aid that has been put together
The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform
Africans, after the tired, we are tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care
We are grateful
But we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it, but us
We have to do it
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start
We have to reform my economy's change our leadership, become more democratic, be more open
To change and to information, and this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigerian
In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa
I want to tell you the one in four subsaharan Africans is Nigerian and it has 140 million dynamic people, chaotic people, but very interesting people
You'll never be bored
What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge of our reforms ourselves
And with the support of Elida who was willing at the time to do the reforms, we put forward a comprehensive reform program which we developed ourselves, not the international monetary fund, not the World Bank, where work for 21 years and rules to be a vice president
No one can do it for you
You have to do it for yourself
We put together a program that would one get the state out of businesses, it had nothing, it had no business been in
The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent
So we decided to to privatize many of our enterprises
We, as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets
Can you believe that prior to this reform, which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington to go and take up the post of finance minister? We had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 land lines in its entire 30-year history
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury
You couldn't get it
You had to bribe
You had to do everything to get it for
When President Obama's angel supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, we went from 4,500 line lines to 32 million GSM lines County
Nigeria's telecoms market is the second fastest growing in the world after China
We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms
And nobody knows, except a few smart people
The smartest one first to come in was the empty-end company of South Africa
And in the three years that I was finance minister, they made an average of $360 million per year, $360 million
In a market, in a country that is a poor country with an average by capital income just under $500 per capital
So the market is there
When they kept this under wraps but soon others got to know Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies and three or four others are coming
But there's a huge market out there and people don't know about it or they don't want to know
So privatization is one of the things we've done
The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well
Nigeria with the oil sector had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances as well
So what did we try to do? We introduced the fiscal rule that the link tab budget from the oil price before we used to just budget on whatever oil would bring in because oil is the biggest most revenue and insect in the economy
70% of our revenues come from oil
We didn't think that
And once we did it, we began to budget at a price, slightly lower than the oil price and save, whatever was above that price
We didn't know we could pull it off
It was very controversial
But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development, where oil prices were high would grow very fast
When they crashed, we crashed, and we could hardly even pay anything any salaries in the economy
That's moved and out
We were able to save just before I left $27 billion
Whereas in this went to our reserves, when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion in reserves
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion, as we speak now, we have about 40 billion in reserves
due to proper management of our finances
And that shows our economy, makes it stable, I exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time, is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy
We brought inflation down from 28% to about 11%
And we had GDP growth from an average of 2
3% the previous decade to about 6
5%
Now, so all the changes and reforms were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy
And what is more important because we want to get away from oil and diversify and there's so many opportunities in this one, country as a many countries in Africa
What was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector, a number from non-oil, agricultural grew at better than 8%
As a teleconsector grew, housing and construction, and I could go on an oil
And this is for the last trade to you that once you get the macroeconomy straightened out, the opportunities and various other sectors are enormous
We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said
We have opportunities in solid minerals
We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in our explode
And we realize that without the proper legislation to make that possible, that wouldn't happen
So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world
We have opportunities in housing and real estate
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people
No shopping malls
as you know them here
This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people
And now we have a situation in which the businesses and this small are doing four times the turn over that they had projected
So huge things in construction, really estate, mortgage markets, financial services
We had 89 banks, too many, not doing the real business
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks
by requiring that they increase their capital, share capital
And it went from about $25 million to $150 million
The banks, these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside, Barclays Bank of the UK's, bringing in 500 million, standard charted this bringing has brought in 140 million, and I can go on dollars on and on into the system
We're doing the same within Sharon sector so in financial services, a great deal of opportunity
In tourism, many African countries, a great opportunity, and that's what many people know East Africa for, the wildlife, the elephants and so on
But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important
So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent
The new wave of openness and democratization in which since 2000, more than 2,000 of African countries have had multi-party democratic elections
Not all of them have been perfect or will be, but the trend is very clear
I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years, the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2
5% to about 5% per annum
which is better than the performance of many OECD countries
So it's clear that things are changing
Conflicts are down on the continent from about 12 conflicts a decade ago, we are down to three or four conflicts one of the most terrible of course of which is therefore
And you know you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent, it looks like the entire continent is affected
But you should know that this continent is not is a continent of many countries
Not one country
And if we're down to three or four conflicts, it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable, growing, exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity
And I want to just make one point about this investment
The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs
There is no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives
That's not what I'm saying
That is fine
But imagine the impact on a family
If the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school, that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves
If we can invest in places where you yourself make money, whilst creating jobs, and may help people stand on their own feet, isn't that a wonderful opportunity, isn't that the way to go? And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women
I have a CD here
I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time otherwise I would have liked you to have seen this
It says Africa opened for business
And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the young to stand at the a woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania where they're having the session in June, but it shows you Africans and particularly African women who against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world class
One of the women in this video, Nico Gunlesley, making children's clothes, which is started as a hobby
And grew into a business, mixing African materials such as we have, with materials from elsewhere, so she'll make a little pair of dongaris with corduroy's with African material mixing
Very creative designs
Has reached a stage where she even had an order from Walmart? For 10,000 pieces
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing And the women are diligent, they are focused, they work hard
I could go and give in examples, Beatriz Gakuva of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business, and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam, each morning, and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her
However, many of these are stopped for capital to expand
Because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do, what is necessary
Nobody thinks in terms of a market
Nobody thinks there's opportunity
But I'm standing here saying that those who missed the boat now will miss it forever
So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing
Think about the Beatrice
Think about the Nickes of this little world who are doing incredible things that are bringing them into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed, and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income
So I invite you to explore the opportunities
When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves
Thank you very much
Thank you
What I'm going to show you first is quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago
This is C-Dragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data
We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming and padding through the thing rearranging it at any way we want
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are, or how big the images are
And the most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress
And it's in the 300 megapixel range
It doesn't make me difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment
It's also a very flexible architecture
This is an entire book
So this is an example of non-image data
This is a bleak house, like Dickens
Every column is a chapter
And to prove to you that it's really text and not an image, we can do something like so
To really show that this is a real representation of the text
It's not a picture
Maybe this is a kind of an official way to read an e-book
I wouldn't recommend it
This is a more realistic case
This is an issue of the guardian
Every large image is the beginning of a section
And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium
We've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the gargain we've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution, much higher than you be able to get in the ordinary
And we've embedded extra content
You've got to see the features of this car you can see it here, or other models, or even technical specifications
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate
We hope that this means no more pop-ups, no other kind of rubbish like that should be necessary
Of course, mapping is one of those really obvious applications for technology like this
And this one I really want to spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well
But those are all the roads in the US superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image
So let's pull up now something else
So this is actually live on the live on the web
Now you can go check it out
This is a project called Photosynth, which really marries two different technologies
One of them is C-Dragon
And the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Snavley, a graduate student University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Sites at U-Dod and Rick Soliski at Microsoft Research, a very nice collaboration
And so this is live on the web
It's powered by C-Dragon
You can see that when we do these sorts of views, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience
But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful
The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together, so if they correspond to the real space in which these shots all taken near grassy lakes and the Canadian Rockies, all these shots were taken
So you see elements here of stabilized slideshow or panoramic imaging
And these things have all been related, really, spatially
I'm not sure if I have, if I have time to show you any other environments, there are some that are much more spatial
But I'd like to jump straight to one of no-as-original data sets
And this is from an early prototype of a photosynth that we first got working in this summer
To show you what I think is really the punchline behind this technology, the photosynth technology
And it's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we've put up on the website
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flicker
It was typed notherdament of flicker, and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts and of the campus and so on
And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model
And so these are all flicker images
And they've all been related spatially in this way
And we can just navigate in this very simple way
I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft, and it was very gratifying
I've got this kind of reception here
So this is, I just can see this is a very, this is lots of different types of cameras
It's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRs
A quite a large number that have been registered together into this environment
If I can find some of the sort of weird ones, there are so many of them are included by faces and so on
There's somewhere in here
There's actually a series of photographs
Here we go
This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly
So if we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment
So what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment
This is now taking data from everybody from the entire collective memory of visually of what the Earth looks like
And link all of that together
All of those photos become linked together
And they make something emergent, this greater than some of the parts
You have a model that emerges of the entire earth, think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's virtual earth work
And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it
Their own photos are getting tagged with metadata that somebody all centered
If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all that data
And I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space since that metaverse using everybody else's photos and do a kind of cross-model and cross-user social experience that way
And of course, a byproduct of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory
Thank you so much
APPLAUSE APPLAUSE That's right, that's right
That's right
That's what I'm asking for
APPLAUSE Do I understand this? Do I understand this right? What your software is going to allow is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together
Yes, what this is really doing is discovering
hyperlinks, if you will, between images
And it's doing that based on the content inside the images
And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have
Like when you do a web search for images, like you type in phrases and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of
Now, what if that picture links to all of your pictures and the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge, it's a classic network effect? Place that is truly incredible
Congratulations
Thanks so much
Thank you
Basically there's a major demographic event going on and maybe the passing the 50% urban point is a economic tipping point
So the world now is a map of connectivity
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities
Well we have now as at the end of the rise of the West, that's over
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming
So what's really going on? Will villages of the world are emptying out? The question is why? Here's the unromantic truth
And the city air makes you free
They said in Renaissance Germany, some people go to places like Shanghai and most go to the squatter cities
We're a aesthetics rule
And these are not really people oppressed by poverty
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can
They're the dominant builders and the largest-nathed dominant designers
They have home-brew infrastructure and vibrant-errant life
One's sixth is the GDP and India is coming out of Mumbai
They're constantly upgrading in a few cases the government helps
Education is the main event that can happen in cities
What's going on in the street in Mumbai? Algoranos
It's basically everything
There's no unemployment in squatter cities
Everyone works
One sixth of humanity is there
It's soon going to be more than that
So here's the first punchline
Cities of defuse the population bomb
Here's the second punchline
That's the news from downtown
Here it is in perspective
It's just another day Just another day It's just another day It's just stars shining down on our life for a million years now we're shining right back up It's just another day
Thank you
You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel in one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past and the wind, touch it and stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants
Just to know that Jaguar-isham and still journey beyond the Milky Way or the myths of the the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the Himalayah, the Buddha still pursue the breath of the Dharma
It's to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but is just one model of reality
The consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago
And of course, We all share the same adaptive imperatives, we're all born, we all bring our children to the world, we go through initiation rights, we have to deal with the inexorable separation of death
So it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have art
But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture
And whether it is the Panan and the Force, the Borneo or the Voodoo Aqualites in Haiti, or the warriors in the Kaisu desert of Northern Kenya, the Kudandeto and the mountains of the Andes, or a Kattavansati in the middle of the Sahara, this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago
Or indeed a yaccerter in the slopes of Chomalunma, Everest, the goddess Mother of the World, all of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself and the earth
And this is an idea that if you think about it, can only fill you with hope
Now, together, the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops a planet
And it's as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is a biological web of life that you know as a biosphere
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethno sphere
And you might define the ethno sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations, intuitions, brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness
The ethno sphere is humanity's great legacy
It's a symbol of all that we are, and all that we can be, as an astonishing and inquisitive species
And just as the biosphere is being severely eroded, so too is the ethno sphere
And if anything at a far greater rate, no biologists, for example, would dare suggest that 50% of all species are more abundant around the brink of extinction because it's simply not true
And yet that, the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity, scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity in the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss
When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules
A language is a flash of the human spirit
It's a vehicle through which a soul of each particular culture comes in the material world
Every language is an old growth force to the mind, a watershed thought and ecosystem of spiritual possibilities
And other of those 6,000 languages, as we see here today in Monterey, fully half or no longer being whispered into the ears of children
They're no longer being taught to babies, which means effectively unless something changes they're already dead
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language? You have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children
And yet that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on earth, roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with them into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue
And I know there are some of you who say, well, wouldn't it be better? Wouldn't there be a better place if we all just spoke one language? And I say, great, let's make that language yourbough
Let's make a Cantonese
Let's make it kogi
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language
And so what I'd like to do with you today is instead of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what, in fact, is being lost
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say different ways of being, I really do mean different ways of being
Take for example this child of the Bada Sanath, the Northwest Amazon, a people of the Anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk rivers in the east and the belly of sacred snakes
Now this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish a color blue from the color green because a canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend
They have a curious language and marriage rule, which is called linguistic exogamy, you must marry someone who speaks a different language
And this is all rooted in the theological past
Yet the curious thing is in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken, because in intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language
They simply listen and then begin to speak
Or one of the most fascinating tribes I've lived with, the Warani of Northeastern Ecuador
And astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958, In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact made a critical mistake
They dropped from the air, ate by 10 glossy photographs of themselves, and what we would say to be friendly gestures
Forgetting that these people are the reinforcements had never seen anything too dimensional in their lives
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form of the figure found nothing and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil, and so they spearred the five missionaries to death
But the Warrani didn't just spear outsideers, they spear did each other
4% of their mortality was due to them spearing each other
We trace genealogy's back-age generations, and we found two instances of natural death, and when we pressured the people a little bit about it, they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway
But at the same time, they had a perspicacious knowledge of the force that was astonishing
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces until you had species left at behind
In the early 80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor Harvard, if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies, which were the foundation of Duvalious Strength and the Tomta Makut, and securing the poison used to make zombies
In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Wdun
And Wdun is not a black magic cult on the contrary
It's a complex metaphysical worldview
It's interesting if I ask you the name, the great religions of the world, what would you say? Christianity is lamb, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever
There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that Sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs
Well, of course, they did
And Voodoo simply, the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era
But what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between living and the dead, the living of birth, the spirits, the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water, responding to the rhythm of the dance
To momentarily display the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, The act light becomes the God, that's why the voodooists like to say that you white people go to church and speak about God, we dance in the temple and become God
And because you are possessed, you are taken by the Spirit, how can you be harmed? You see these astonishing demonstrations, food to act lights, in a state of trans, handling burning embers with impunity, a rather astonishing example of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when pedilies in the state of extreme excitation
Now of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary, or the kooky, of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and Northern Columbia, the sentence of the ancient Tyrone civilization which once targeted the Caribbean coasts so plain of Columbia, and the way to the conquest, these people retreated into an isolated volcanic messseaf that soars above the Caribbean coasts so plain
In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish
To this day, they remained ruled by a ritual priesthood, but they're training for the priest to this rather extraordinary
The young oxides are taken away from their families at the age of three and four
It's a quest for the shadowy world of darkness and stone huts the base of glaciers for 18 years
To nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation, they spend in their natural mother's womb
Now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother
And for this entire time, they are encultured into the values of their society
Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic or we might say the ecological balance
And at the end of this amazing initiation, one day they're suddenly taken out
And for the first time in their lives, the age of 18, they see a sunrise
And in that crystal moment of awareness the first light, as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of this stunningly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed and stunning glory
And the pre-step's back and so you see it's really, as I've told you, it is that beautiful
It is yours to protect
They call themselves the elder brothers
And they say, we, who are the younger brothers, are the ones responsible for destroying the world
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important
Whenever we think of indigenous people in landscape, we either invoke Russo and the old canard, the noble savage, which is an idea of racism and simplicity, or alternatively we invite invoke for row and say these people are closer to the earth than we are
Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weak by nostalgia
There's not a lot of room for either in the malaria swamps of the Asmat, who are in the chilling winds of Tibet
But they have nevertheless through time and ritual forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-conscious and close to it, but on a far-suttler intuition
The idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it has breathing the bean by human consciousness
Now what does that mean? It means He said, a young kid from the Andes, whose raised to believe that that mountain is an aposperid that will direct his or her destiny, will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource, or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountainous pile of rock ready to be mined
Whether it's a boat of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant, what's interesting is the metaphor that defines a relationship between the individual and the natural world
I was raised in the forest, the British Columbia to believe those forest existed to be cut
That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the cogules who believe that those forests were the boat of Hukuku, and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwell to the north end of the world, spirits they would have to engage during their hammet's initiation
Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you can begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries
Take this plant here
the photograph I took in the northwest Amazon just last April
This is Ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psychoactive of preparation of the Shaman's repertoire
What makes Ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it
It's made really of two different sources
On the one hand, this Woody Leon, I which has in it a series of beta carbolines, harming, harmingly, and mildly, hallucinogenic to take the vignalones rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness
But it's mixed with a leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychotry of theardis
This plant has in it some very powerful triptomines, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyl triptomine five, methoxy dimethyl triptomine
If you've ever seen the yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that substance they make from a different set of species is also contains five methoxy dimethyl triptomine
have that powder blown up your nose, his rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel, lines with broke paintings and landing on a sea of electricity
It doesn't create the distortion of reality
It creates the delusion of reality
In fact, I used to argue with my professor Richard Emsulti, who was a man who sparked this like it
I look at ERA with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s
I used to argue that you couldn't classify these Trifter means it's hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects, there's no in home anymore to experience a hallucination
But the thing about Trifter means is they cannot be taken orally because their denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoaminoxidase
They can only be taken orally as taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatured the MAO
Now, the fascinating things that the beta carbonyms found within that Lyanna are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the trip to me
So you asked yourself a question, how in a flora of 80,000 species of asteroid or plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that we can bind in this way created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being created in some of the parts? Well, we use that great euphemism trial in the era, which is exposed to be meaningless
But you ask the Indians and they say the plants talked to us
Well, what does that mean? This tried the co-fon has 17 varieties of Ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to R-I as one species
And then you ask them how they establish your taxonomy, and they say, I thought you knew something about plants
I mean, do you know anything? And I said, no
Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties on the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key
Now, that's not going to get you a PhD at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting statements
Now, the problem, the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with applied at indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful, but somehow reduce to the margins of history as a real world, meaning our world moves on
Well, the truth is, a 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather the air in which we stood by, neither actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological cultural diversity on the planet
Now the problem isn't change
All cultures through all time have constant being engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life
And the problem is not technology itself
The Sue Indians did not stop being Sue when they gave up the bone arrow, any more than American, stopped being an American when you gave up the horse and buggy
It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere
It is power
the crude face of domination
And whenever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away
These are dynamic living peoples being driven out of the existence by identifying how forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to
Whether it's the egregious T
Forestation in the homeland of the Penan, a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak, a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution On the banks of the rivers where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half a borno way to the so-chianise where the Japanese freighters hang light on the horizon ready to fill their holes with raw logs from the forest
Or in the case of the Anomami, it's a disease entities that have come in in the wake of the discovery of gold
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination
You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but ethnicide, the destruction of people's way of life is not only not condemned, it's universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategy
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level
I once traveled 6,000 miles from Chendu and Western China over land through Southeast to Bet to Lasa, where the young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lasa that I understood the face behind these statistics you hear about, 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes, 1
2 million people killed by the cadreater in the Cultural Revolution
This young man's father had been a scribe for the Potchen Lama
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion
His uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to Nepal
His mother was incarcerated for the price of crime of being wealthy
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails, which she couldn't bear to be without him
The sister had done that brave deed, was put into an education camp, one day she had inadvertently stepped on an armband that of Mao, and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard labor
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold
And in the end, it really comes down to a choice
Do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony? Or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity? Margaret Meade, the great anthropologist, said before she died, that her greatest fear that was, was that as we drift toward this blindly amorphous, generic world view, not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination, reduced to a more narrow and more narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten but there were even other possibilities
And it's humbling to remember that our species has perhaps been around for 600,000 years
The Neolithic Revolution, which gave us agriculture at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed, the poetry of the Shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood, recreated hierarchy, specialization, surplus, is only 10,000 years ago
The modern industrial world, as we know, it is barely 300 years old
Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia
When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices
And it's within that song that we all read the governability of being what we are, a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples in all gardens find a way to flourish
And there are great moments of optimism
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip the bath in Ireland when I went in our well-hunting with some Inuit people
And this man, O'Layak, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather
The Canadian government has not always been kind of the Inuit people
And during the 1950s to establish her sovereignty, we forced them into settlements
Sisyphal man, grandfather refused to go
The family fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools
Now, you must understand that Inuit did not fear the cold
They took advantage of it
the runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in carabouhide
So this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night for the blizzard that was blowing
He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand
As a thesis began to freeze, he shaped it in the form of a blade
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he blitzered a dog with it
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness, took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled, harnessed up in the Jason Dog, and disappeared over the ice flows, shit nice and belt
Talk about getting by with nothing
And this in many ways is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world
The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit, an In the area of land, large and California and Texas put together
It's our new homeland, it's called Nunevit, it's an independent territory, they control all mineral resources
An amazing example of how a nation state can reach sea restitution with its people
And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious, at least to all of us who have traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all
They're home lands of somebody
They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time
And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geography of hope
So what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything
We think that the Palemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world
And so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world
We get 35 million hits on our website every month
156 nations carry our television channel, our magazines are read by millions
And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethno sphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen
And hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually one by one, the central revelation of anthropology that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live an a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being
Thank you very much
Thank you
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students cut down to three minutes
And it all started one day on a plane on my way to Ted seven years ago
And then the seat next to him was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family
And she wanted to make something of her life
And she asked me a simple little question
She said, what leads to success
And I felt really badly because I couldn't give her a good answer
So I get off the plane and I come to Ted
And I think, geez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people
So why don't I ask them what help them succeed and pass it on to kids? So here we are
Seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes Tetschers take
And the first thing is passion
Freeman Thomas says, I'm driven by my passion
Tetschers do it for love
They don't do it for money
Carol Collettis says, I would pay someone to do what I do
The interesting thing is if you do it for love, the money comes anyway
Work
Rupert Murdoch said to me, it's all hard work
Nothing comes easily
But I have a lot of fun
Did he say, fun? Rupert? Yes
Tests are still have fun working and they work hard
I figured they're not workaholics
They're workahphrolics
Good
Alice Carden says, the B successful
Put your nose down and something and get damn good at it
There's no magic, it's practice, practice, practice
And as focus, Normadjuus and said to me, I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing
And push
David Gallos has pushed yourself, physically, manly, you've got to push, push, push
You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt
Goli Han says, I always had self-doubt
I wasn't good enough, I wasn't smart enough, I didn't think I'd make it
Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers
Frank Geary said to me, my mother pushed me
Serve
Sure when Newman says it was a privilege to serve as a doctor
Now a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires and the first thing I say to them is, okay, you can't serve yourself, you got to serve others something of value because that's the way people really get rich
Ideas, headster Bill Gates says, I had an idea
the first micro computer software company
I'd say it was a pretty good idea and there's no magic to creativity and coming up with ideas
It's just doing some very simple things and I give lots of evidence
Persist Joe Kraus says persistence is a number one reason for our success
You got to persist through failure
You got to persist through crap which of course means criticism rejection, assholes and pressure
So the big answer to this question is, question is simple, pay 4,000 bucks and come to Ted
Or failing that, do the eight things and trust me
These are the big eight things that lead to success
Thank you, teachers for all your interview
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
I want to start off by saying Houston, we have a problem
We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space
In fact, we were dressed
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done
And that is instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places and found out later, maybe to our surprise that that's the reason we survived
And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's okay to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video and they need to look forward to exploration
They need to look forward to colonization
They need to look forward to breakthroughs
They need to, we need to inspire them because they need to lead us in help us survive in the future
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA is doing right now with this new bush doctrine for this next decade and a half of shoot I screwed up
But we have real specific instructions here, not to talk about politics
What we are looking forward to is what we are looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children, but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country, the Boeing's and Lockheed Space Engineers, to go out and take risks and try new stuff
We're going to go back to the moon and move 50 years later, and we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new
I'm really troubled by that
Anyway, that's the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though, is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later
That's a theme of my next 15 minutes here
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young
Three year olds up to 12, 14 year olds
What they look at is the most important thing
Let's take a snapshot at aviation
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened
Started in 1908 when the Wright brothers flew in Paris and everybody said, I can do that
There was only a few people that had flown in early 1908
In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousands of pilots
Airplanes was invented by natural selection
Now you can say that intelligent design designs are airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes
There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried
And when they crash and kill the pilot, And I don't try that again
The ones that flew and landed OK, because there was no train pilots who were had good flying qualities by definition
So we by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts
In that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today
And that's why they're so safe as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good
That has not happened at all in space flying
There's only been two concepts tried, two by the US and one by the Russians
Well, who was inspired during that time period aviation week asked me to make a list of who I thought or the movers and chargers of the first 100 years of aviation and I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful Renaissance of aviation
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was, it was some pretty heavy stuff too
The jet age started
The missile age started
on Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars
And this was before Spudnik
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now
We thought there'd be animals there
We knew there were plants there
The colors changed, right? But NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed only in the deserts
The, if you look at what happened, this is a black line, is as fast as man ever flew
And the red line is a top of the line military fighters
And the blue line is commercial air transport
You know, there's a big jump when I was a little kid
And I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try
Well, what did I do when I was a kid? I didn't do the hot rods and the girls and the dancing and then well, we didn't have drugs in those days
But I did competition model airplanes
I spent about seven years there in a Vietnam word flight testing airplane for the Air Force, and then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages
And some 3,000 of these are flying, of course, one of them around the world Voyager
I found another company in 82, which is my company now, and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart
The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet
State and service, tell it was too rusty to fly and take an out of service
We retreated in 98 back to something that was developed in 56
What? The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a grumant lunar lander
It was a land on the moon, take off on the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys
That's kind of cool
We've lost that capability
We banded it in 1972
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1960
Well, three years
And we can't do that now
Crazy
Talk very briefly about innovation cycles
Things that grow have a lot of activity
They die out when they replace by something else
These things tend to happen every 25 years, 40 years long with an overlap
You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies
The interesting thing, by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles
There is none here
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958
Here's the biggie, and that is you don't have innovation cycles
If the government develops in the government uses it, you know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net
The other computers were used for artillery first, then IRS
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it
Private sector has to do it
Keep that in mind
I put down innovation
I've looked for innovation cycles in space, and I found none
The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space, and a few weeks later, Alan Sheppard, there were five men's base flights in the world, the very first year
In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed
There were only three or four flights in 2003
In 2004, there were only two flights, two Russians, so-use flights to the International Men's Station, And I had to fly three in Mahavee with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five, which was the number the same year back in 1961
There is no growth, there is no activity, there's no nothing
This is a picture here, taken from spaceship one
This is a picture here taken from orbit
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that
We know how to do it for suborbital flying now, do it safe enough
At least as safe as the early airlines
So that can be done
And I think that I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company
First of all, what's going to happen next? The first industry will be a high volume
A lot of players
There's another one announced just last week
And it will be suborbital
And the reason it has to be suborbital is there is not solutions for atiquit safety to fly the public to orbit
The governments have been doing this three governments have been doing this for 45 years and still 4% of the people that left the atmosphere have died
And you know what to run a business with that kind of a safety right here
It'll be very high volume
We think a hundred thousand people will fly by 2020
I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule
But I think once it does, we will find solutions
And very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit
And that really easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon
So you have this cool view
And that'll be really cool
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere
You can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet
if you want that, oh, that's going to be so much fun
Okay
My critics say, hey, Routaine's just been in a lot of these billionaires money to for joy rights for billionaires
What's this? And it's not transportation system
It's just for fun
And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute
I bought my first Apple computer in 1978
And I bought it because I could say, I got a computer at my house and you don't
And what do you use it for? Come over it, it does frogger
Okay? Not the banks computer or lock-age computer, but the home computer was for games
For a whole decade, it was for fun
We didn't even know what it was for
But what happened the fact that we had this big industry, big development, big improvement and capability and so on, and they get out there and enough homes, we were ripe for a new invention
And the inventor is in this audience
Al Gore invented the internet
And because of that, what something that we use for a whole year is give me a whole decade for fun became everything
Our commerce, our research, our communication
And if we let the Google guys think for another couple of weekends, we can add, it doesn't more things to the list
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our home
So fun is defendable
OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart
But it in it is my prediction with what's going to happen
And in it also brings up another point, right here, there's a group of people that have come forward
And you don't know all of them
But the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three to 15 year old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period
Paul Allen, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos
The Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians suborbital thing
Bob Bigelow, a private space station and Karmac
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area
And I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of better cell phone or something
But they're putting it in various areas
And this will lead us into this kind of capability
And it will lead us into the next really big thing
And it'll allow us to explore
And I think eventually it'll allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct
They were inspired by big progress
But look at the progress that's going on after that
There were a couple of examples here
The military fighters had a highest performance military airplane was the SR-71
It went a whole life cycle
Got too rusty to fly and was taken out of service
The Concord doubled the speed for airline travel
It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service
And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late 50s
But something is out there to inspire our kids now
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, if you've got a 10 year old now
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here
Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplanes never happened before
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes, why do you need something better
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying suborbital flights to space, very soon, wait a minute
What's happening here? We'll have military fighters
We'll suborbital capability, and I think very soon this
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first
OK, I look forward to a new capitalist space race
Let's call it
Remember the space race in the 60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones
We didn't lose them technically
The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it, you can argue that's not a technical loss
But it was a technical loss
But it was a prestige loss
America, the world saw America as not being the leader, technology, and that was a very strong thing
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagera, not months or decades or whatever
So we had the capability, but America lost
We lost
And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it
Well again, it's interesting here as we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America
Can't do it
You can buy it in Russia
You can fly with Russian hardware
This is available because a Russian space program is starving and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats
It's commercial
It's can be defined as space tourism
There are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done
100 million bucks? Okay, go to the moon
But you know, would you have thought back in the 60s when the space race was going on that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do? Oh, do I have ticket to go the moon? Would be a Russian hardware
And would you have thought with the Russians of thought that when they first go to the moon and they're developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians
Maybe it will probably be a Japanese or American billionaire
Well, that's weird
It really is
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful private spaceflight industry
Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter, the Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concord
And then they flew a few cargo floods and took it out of service
You know, I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered
Okay, I'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human spaceflight
This little thing says there are five times what NASA is doing by 2020
I want to tell you already there's about a billion and a half to a billion point seven investment in private spaceflight that is not government at all
Are ready? We're a way
If you read, if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money
But there's twice of that being committed out there
Not spent yet, but being committed and planned for the next few years
Hey, that's pretty big
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be
And it certainly is profitable when you fly people at $200,000 on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or less
This is going to be very profitable
I predict also that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the US taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by factor of 10 to 15
And what that means is before we know it, the progress in human space flight
With no taxpayer dollars, we'll be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space life
And that is because it's us, it's private industry
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff and we've done it for long time the NACA before NASA never developed an airliner and never ran an airline
But NASA is developing the space liner always has and runs the only space line
And we've tried away from it because we were afraid of it
But starting back in June of 2004 when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, can get a start with it
Everything changed after that time
Okay, thank you very much
I want to start with a story of a Seth Gauden from when I was 12 years old
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater at this eye thought
It was beautiful
It had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru kind of right across the chest that were also fuzzy
I wore it whenever I could thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned
Until one day in ninth grade when I was standing with a number of football players And my body had clearly changed and Matt Musselinow who was undeniably my nemesis in high school, set in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz
And I'm so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her forever letting me wear the hideous sweater
We drove to the good well and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously
my idea being that I would never have to think about this sweater nor see it ever again
Fast forward, 11 years later, on the 25-year-old kid, working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes
When I see 10 feet in front of me, a little boy, 11 years old, running toward me wearing my sweater
And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible
But so curious, I run up to the child
Of course, scaring the living Vajizat out of him, grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there's my name written on the collar of this sweater
I tell that story because it has served and continues to serve as metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be that this traveled into the goodwill in Virginia and moved its way into the larger industry, which is that point was giving millions of tons of second-hand clothing to African Asia, which was a very good thing, providing low-cost clothing
And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industry
Not to say that it shouldn't have, but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses
So I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa in 1985, 1986, where I was doing two things
I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers
We called the Bad News Bears, and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali, which was not hard because there were no snacks before us
And because we had a good business model, we actually did it
And I watched these women transform on a micro level
But at the same time, I started a microfinance bank
And tomorrow, Ikbok Kadeer is going to talk about Grammene, which is the grandfather of all microfinance banks, which now is a worldwide movement
You talk about a meme
But then it was quite new, especially in a economy that was moving from barter into trade
We got a lot of things right
We focused on a business model
We insisted on skin in the game
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day
As to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses, earn more income so they could take care of their families better
What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us with the confluence of fear, ethnic, strife, and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into this invisible, but certainly palpable movement inside Wanda
at that time 30% of the budget was all far and eight
The genocide happened in 1994, seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream
And the good news was that the institution, the banking institution lasted
In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country
The bakery was completely wiped out
But the lessons for me were that accountability counts, got to build things with people on the ground
Using business models were a Stephen level would say, The incentives matter, understand how ever complex we make be incentives matter
So when Chris raised to me, how wonderful everything that was happening in the world that we were seeing as shift in zeitgeist, on the one hand, I absolutely agree with him
And I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldoff, the world is talking about global poverty, the world is talking about Africa and why I have never seen in my life
It's thrilling
And at the same time, what keeps me up at night is a fear that will look at the victories of the G8, $50 billion in increased aid to Africa, $40 billion in reduced debt as the victory, as more than chapter one, as our moral evolution
And in fact, what we need to do is see that is chapter one, celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution, all about the how-to
And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor in ways that are financially sustainable and scalable
If we do that, we really can make poverty history
And it was that whole philosophy that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called Acumen Fund, which is trying to build some mini-blue prints for how we might do that in water, health, and housing in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania, and Egypt
And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples, so you can see what it is that we're doing
But before I do this, and this is another one of my pet food peeps, I want to talk a little about who the poor are because we too often talk about the Mesquise, strong, huge masses of people, you're needing to be free
When in fact, it's quite an amazing story
On a macro level, 4 billion people on Earth make less than $4 a day
That's who we talk about when we think about the four
If you aggregated it to the third largest economy on Earth, then you have most of these people go invisible
Where we typically work as people making between one and three dollars a day
Who are these people? They are farmers and factory workers
They work in government offices
They're drivers
They are domestic
They typically pay for critical goods and services like water, like healthcare, like housing
And they pay 30 to 40 times with their middle class counterparts pay
Certainly, where we work in Karachi and Nairobi
The poor also are willing to make and do make smart decisions if you give them that opportunity
So two examples
One is in India where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than $2 a day
Where we work in a Rangabad, the land is extraordinarily parsed
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur name Amitaba
What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches, and figure out how to trip irrigation, which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock
But previously, it's only been created for large scale farms
So on the top it took this and modularized it down to a eighth of an acre
A couple of principles, build small, make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor
This family, Serita and her husband bought a $15 unit when they were living in a literally three-walled lean-to with it, corrugated iron, roof
They, after one harvest, they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter acre
A couple years later, I meet them
They now make $4 a day, which is pretty much middle class for India, and they showed me the concrete foundation
They just laid to build their house
Then I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes, something I truly believe
You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria beddets
And I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage
For $5, you can save a life
Malaria's disease that kills 1 to 3 million people a year
300 to 500 million cases are reported
It's estimated that Africa loses about $13 billion a year to the disease
$5 can save a life
We can send people to the moon
We can see if there's life on Mars
why can't we get $5 net to $500 million people? The question though is not, why can't we? The question is, how can we help Africans do this for themselves? A lot of hurdles
One production is too low, two prices too high
Three, this is a good road in right near where our factory is located, distribution is a nightmare
But not impossible
We started by making a $350,000 loan to the largest traditional bednet manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer a technology from Japan and build these long lasting five year nets
Here are just some pictures of the factory
Today, three years later, the company has employed another thousand women
It contributes about $600,000 in wages to the economy of Tanzania, the largest company in Tanzania
The throughput rate right now is 1
5 million nets, 3 million by the end of the year
we hope to have 7 million at the end of next year
So the production side is working
On the distribution side though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do right now, 95% of these nets are being bought by the UN, and then given, primarily, to people around Africa
We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa people, they're women
And so I want you to meet Jacqueline, my name's take 21 years old
If she were born anywhere else, the Tanzania, I'm telling you she could run Wall Street
She runs two of the lines and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house
She makes about $2 a day
It's creating an education fund and told me she is not marrying or having children until these things are completed
And so when I told her about our idea that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others
She quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up
We took a lesson from IDO, one of our favorite companies, and quickly did a prototyping on this
And Chuck, Jacqueline, into the area where she lives, she brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets $5 a piece despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one
And we learned a lot about how you sell things, not coming in with our own notions, because She didn't even talk about malaria until the very end
First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty
These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house
Children can sleep through the night
The house looks beautiful
You hang them in the window
And we start making curtains
And not only is it beautiful, but people can see status that you care about your children
Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor
I wanna end just by saying that there's a non-ass opportunity to make poverty history
To do it right, we have to build business models that matter, that are scalable, and that work with Africans, Indians, people all over the developed in world who fit in this category to do it themselves
Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement, it's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, but they want to make their own decisions, they want to solve their own problems, and that by engaging with them, not only do we create much more dignity for them, but for us as well
And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how do we engage with this notion, and this opportunity that we all have to make poverty history by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us and them world, and realizing that it's about all of us and the kind of world that we together want to live it in share
Thank you
Right, thank you
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in right at the point where I get this thing to work
Here we go
I'm going to talk about five different things
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together and actually talk about this a bit more than we do
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well of course
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging
Then I'm going to spend perhaps a second half of the talk talking about how we might actually be able to prove that our fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about it
I'm going to do that in two steps
The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension, which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people who are already in middle-aged when you start, to appoint which can genuinely be called defeating aging, namely essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year, or indeed to get sick in the first place
And of course the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years, life extension
So I'm going to start with why we should
Now I want to ask a question, hands up, anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria
That was easy
Okay, hands up, okay, hands up, anyone in the audience is not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing
Okay, so we often malaria is a bad thing
That's very good news because I thought that would be answered would be
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria, that it shares with aging, and here is that characteristic
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does
Now, I like an audience in Britain, especially to talk about the comparison with Foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle by the government, not very many months ago
I know I am with a sympathetic audience here, but as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic
This is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me
A lot of people said, well, you know, it's that city boys have no business telling us or telling us rural types what to do with our time
It's a traditional part of the way of life, and we shouldn't be, which should be that carry on doing it
It's ecologically sound, it's top to population explosion of foxes
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the British public and certainly the majority of members of parliament came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilised society
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades
What part of this do people not understand? It's not just about life, of course
It's about healthy life
Getting frail and miserable independent is no fun
Whether or not dying maybe fun
So really, this is what a little highlighted described
It's a global chance
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging
And I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that nothing goes too well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging
But these are completely crazy
When you actually, remember your sense of proportion
These are arguments
These are things that you have a legitimate, it would be legitimate to be concerned about
But the question is, are they so dangerous? These risks of doing something about aging, that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite, namely leaving aging as it is? Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death? If you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, if what I say
Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is
People worry about overpopulation
They say, well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing St
Giles, Calacitly
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, kids are really important to most people
And that's true
And a lot of people try to find this question and give answers like this
I don't agree with those answers
I think they basically don't work
I think it's true that we will face a dilemma in this respect
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate or a high death rate
The high death rate will of course arise from simply rejecting these therapies and in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids
And I say that that's fine
The future of humanity is is entitled to make that choice
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future
If we isolate and hesitate and do not actually develop these therapies, then we are condemning a whole cohort of people who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies, but will not be because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could
We will be denying those people in a definite lifespan and I can tell you that that is immoral
That's my answer to the other population question
So the next thing is, you know, why should we get a little bit more active on this? And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging class is not as dumb as it looks
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of agents
Aging is ghastly, bust
It's inevitable
So, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything
But we might want to do to do that
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear, and we might be in range of doing something about aging, this becomes part of the problem
This pro-aging transition, what stops us from meditating about these things
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot, evangelize, I will let have our eyes to say, quite a lot, in order to get people's attention and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard
So that's what I'm going to say about that
I'm not going to talk about feasibility
And the fundamental reason I think why we feel that aging is inevitable is some in a definition of aging that I'm giving here
A very simple definition, aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolites
I mean, this is not a completely total logical statement
It's a reasonable statement
Aging is a basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars, and it also happens to us despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms
because those self-reparameterism does not perfect
So basically metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effects
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology
That's a fine definition
So we can put it this way
We can say that we have this chain of events
And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging
Though, while I'm calling here the georontology approach and the geriatric approach, the geriatrician will intervene late in the day when pathology is becoming evident
And that Jerry Thesson will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite soon
Of course, it's a very short-termist strategy
It's a losing battle because the things that are causing the pathology of becoming more abundant as time goes on
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface because it's, you know, prevention is better than cure
But unfortunately, the thing is that we don't understand the tabellism very well
In fact, we have a pitifully putter understanding of how organisms work
ourselves, we're not really too good on the S, we discover things like, for example, R&A interference, only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work
Basically, gerontology is a finer approach in the end, but if you're not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention
So then, what we do about that? I mean, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty unclad, doesn't it? But it isn't
Before I tell you why, it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two, just the pose, as I said, that we do acquire
Let's say we do it today, for second argument, the ability to confer 30 extra year of healthy life on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55
I'm going to call that robust human redefinition
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today, or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapy to arrive, would actually live? In order to answer that question, you might think it's simple, but it's not simple
We can't just say, well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer
That's the wrong answer
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress
There are two sorts of technological progress really for this purpose
There are fundamental major breakthroughs and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs
Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of timeframes
Fundamental breakthroughs, very hard to predict how long long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough
With a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun and it took us in until 1903 to actually work out how to do it
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform
I think these are, this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight
We can think really that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventors of the previous one, if you like
It's sort of the incremental advances that add up to something which is not incremental anymore
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough
And you see it in all sorts of technologies
Compute it if you can look at a more or less parallel timeline that happened to be quite a bit later
You can look at medical care, I mean hygiene, vaccine, antibiotics, you know, the same sort of time frame
So I think that actually, step two that I call a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all
That in fact, the people who are young enough benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapy's arrived, will be at some sort of cost
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game
They will be, the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us
This is a very important point for me to get across because most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people are alive today are going to live to 1000 or more
They think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1000 or more
I'm not saying that at all
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200 year old style before we have any 200 year old
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on
I've decided to give this a little name, which is a longevity escape velocity
And it seems to get the point across
So these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health
If a given age is that they were at the time that these therapies arrive, if you're already a hundred or even if you're 80 and average 80 year old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies because you're too close to their store for the really initial, initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you
You won't be able to withstand them
But if you're only 50, then the chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive
And eventually, eventually get through this and becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness, vertical and mental in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes
And of course, if you're younger than that, then you're not going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150 year old, we don't know how all that person is today because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first generation therapies
But irrespective of that age, I'm claiming that the first person to live to a thousand subject of course to global catastrophes is actually probably only about 10 years younger than the first 150 year old and that's quite a thought
All right, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk my last seven and a half minutes
On step one, namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to a scalability? And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human radiation
I'm calling it robust mouse radiation
Not very imaginatively
And this is what it is
I say we're going to take a long live strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average
We do exactly nothing to them until they were already two years old
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them
And with those therapies, we get them to live on average to their fifth birthday
So in other words, we add two years
We trouble their remaining lifespan starting from the point that we started the therapies
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone? I talked about earlier for humans, which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human redevenation or longevity, escape velocity
But secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things starting from the time we get the mice? And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it? And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question and it's extremely hard to answer
One has to be very speculative and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more
I say that's nonsense
I say we are absolutely irresponsible if we stay silent on this
We need to give our best guests as to the timeframes in order to give people a sense of proportions so that they can assess their priorities
So I say that we have a 50-50 chance of reaching this R
H
R
milestone robust human redevenation within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mass redevenation
15 years from the robust mass
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that
The public tend to underestimate how difficult scientific things are
So they'll probably think it's five years away
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public assign biblical into about aging now is the global trans I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy that will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice, so we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes and of course that has enormous implications
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging
I'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that against ventrily-caused pathology
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology, the damage itself is caused ongoingly throughout life starting before we're born
But it is not part of metabolism itself
And this turned that to be useful because we can redraw original diagram this way
We can say that fundamentally the difference between georontology and georiactic is that Their ontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage
I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological turns in the moment
And during iterations try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology and the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way
We can call it the engineering approach and I claim that the engineering approach is within range
The engineering approach does not intervene in any process, it does not intervene in this process all this one and that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle and it's something that we are within range of being able to do because it doesn't involve improving on evolution
The engineering approach simply says let's go in and periodically repair all of these various types of damage
Not necessarily rather completely but repair them quite a lot so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic
We know that this threshold exists because we don't get a delay he designed until we're in mid-late, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born
Why do I say that we're in-range? Well, this is basically it
That's the point about this slide is actually the bottom
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for ageing, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for ageing in one way or another
This list is just for illustration, it is incomplete
The list is on the right
It is also incomplete
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related and it's just an incomplete list
Well, I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete
This is the list of types of things that qualify as damage, side effects of metabolism, and that cause pathology in the end, or that might cause pathology
And there are only seven of them
They're quite a category of things, of course
But there's only seven of them
So loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondrial and so on
And first of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete
Of course, one can make a biological argument, what can say, okay, what are we made of, we made of cells and stuff between cells? Well, what can damage accumulate in the answer is long-lived molecules, because if I thought if molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed, like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis, then the damage has gone to
It's got to be long-lived molecules
So these seven things were all under discussion in derontology a long time ago
And that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years
So the fact that we haven't had extended this list, pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done
However, it's better than that, we actually know how to fix them all in mice in principle
And what I mean by in principle is, we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top
I haven't got time to go through the mature, but if we can, my conclusion is that if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse redevelopenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it, we do need to really start trying
So of course there is some biologists in the audience and you see I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk, but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff
I've published a great deal on this
I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based and there's quite a lot of detail there
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive timeframes that I'm predicting here
So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better down well go and find out why you think I'm wrong
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves geologist because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously
So you've got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true
I will just answer with a few things
One thing is you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said, sometimes a guy that he could sequence a human genome in half no time
and everyone said, well, it's obviously impossible
And you know what happened
So you know, this does happen
We have various strategies
There's the Miss Diesel Amaz prize, which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do what you think is going to work and you get money for it, if you win
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute
This is what's going to take a bit of money
But I mean, look, how long did it take to spend that on the war in Iraq? Not very long, okay? It's got to be philanthropic because profits distract by attack, but it's basically got a 90% chance, I think of succeeding in this, and I think we'd now have to do it
And I'll pop that, thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
All right
I don't know if there's going to be any questions, but I thought it would be for the chance
Since you've been talking about aging, and trying to defeat it, why is it that you make yourself here like an old man? Look at that
Because I am an old man, I am actually 158, I am sure
Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die
So when cells divide the telomerates, get shorter and eventually species die
why does evolution has seems to have selected against immortality when it is so advantageous or is evolution just incomplete? Brilliant
Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer
I'm going to tell you the general, the genuine mainstream answer to your question, which I happen to agree with
Which is that no, aging is not a product of selection
Evolution is simply a product of evolutionary neglect
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work, not to have aging
you need more genetic pathway, more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly, and that carries on being true the longer you put it out
So to the extent that it's, it doesn't, it doesn't, E-relation doesn't matter, doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation
There's a certain amount of modulation of that, which is why different species have different lifespans, but that's why there are no immortal species
The genes don't care, but we do
That's right
Hello, I read some of that in the last 20 years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet as grown by 10 years If I project that that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don't crash from my motorbike That means that I'm one of your subjects to become 1000 year old if you live a bit of weight Wait
There you are
Your numbers are a bit out
The standard numbers are that life spans been growing up between one and two years per decade
So it's not quite as good as you might think
You might hope
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible
I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo and that the brain cells last 80 years or so
If that is indeed true biologically, are there implications in the world of rejuvenation? If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years as opposed to typical, you know, a couple of months? There are technical implications certainly
Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells that are respectable right, especially neurons
But we don't want to replace them any faster than that or not much faster anyway because we're repeating them too fast would degrade cognitive function
Well, I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on, with a little bit of an oversimplification that are aspect of having no aging, hydrophobic, for example, but they do it by not having another system
And not having any tissue effect that relies on their function on very long-lived cells that live more or less indefinitely
That's here for Aubrey Degre

music music I am really sure I won here
I mean, this has to do with technology and entertainment design
Well, I come by iPod, cell phone, and computer-estec analogy, but this has nothing to do with that
So I didn't get a research on it
Well, this is what I found, of course I hope I can minimize it
Well, I basically made a one-back and four-mouse ring that playing a string to string my bits and criticism, so I'm passes to a piece of wood card bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified
But let me think
Okay
On the other hand, we're placing your finger at a different place in another fingerboard, to the string length that's changed as frequency of the sound wave
Oh my gosh
This is sort of a technology, but I can call it a 16-century technology, but actually the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or web transmission nowadays are still basically standard seeing principle of producing projecting sound
Isn't that cool? I am in love
I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, would you like to play the violin or the piano? I looked up a giant monster and said to myself, I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day

Entertainment, I love the entertainment

I'm also the first time here
I don't know what to say
I'm really happy that Mr
Anderson invited me
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone
And the song that I just played was by Joseph Hoffman
It's called Colitiscope and Hoffman is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century And he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time I have another piece that I'd like to play for you
It's called Obeg variations by Robert Schumann a German 19th century composer The name Abek is actually AB, EGG, and that's the main theme of the melody
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends
But he wrote that for his wife
So actually if you listen carefully, there's supposed to be five variations on this I'll back theme
It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you like it

music music music music music music music music music music Now comes the part that I hate
Well, because Mr
Anderson told me that this session is called sync and flow, I was wondering what do I know that these geniuses don't? So I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start
How do I compose? I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose
What I do first is I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the abit that you just heard
And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide out of all the styles of music, what kind of style that I want
And this year I composed a romantic style
So for inspiration, I listened to list and Tikoski and all the great romantic composers
Next I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers
They help me plan out the whole piece and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas because then you have to think
And then when the piece takes somewhat of a solidified form, so let it find, excuse me, solidified form, you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall performance of the composition
And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing, drawing because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art, I think that's a crazy among teens right now
And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing, it's your character
You want to decide who do you want to draw or if you want to draw an original character
Then you want to decide how are you going to draw the character? Am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer? Am I going to use two page spread? Like a comic book for more grandiose effect, I guess
You have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is your structure of a piece
you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need, that's polishing the drawing
And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted
So if I'm trying to do homework, if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or waste my time
And then what happens is sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all
And it's like there's too much on your mind
You can't focus on what you're supposed to do
And sometimes if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it
But it doesn't come naturally
What happens is if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly
And then that's what I consider flow
Because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything
you feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want
I'm not going to play my own composition today because although I did finish it, it's way too long
Instead, I'd like to try something called improvisation
I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet and I'd like someone to come up here and choose five
Anyone to come up here and choose five and then I can make it into some sort of melody and not improvise it
Wow! Of all the cheer! Yay! Let's do it to you
Thank you
Okay
I guess five cards
Any five cards? Okay
Two
Yes
D&F
Two familiar
Okay, A for effort
Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them? Okay, C, G, B, A and E
Thank you very much
I wonder about these
I won't use them
Thank you
Now she chose C, G, B, A, E
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order
Okay, that's nice
So I'm going to have a moment to think and I'll try to make something out of it

The next song or the encore that I'm going to play is called Bumble Buggie by Jack Fina
music music music Thank you
If you're here today and I'm very happy that you are, you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves
However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City
And that's because most people with decision-making powers in both the public and the private sector really don't feel as though they're in danger
The reason why I'm here today in part is because of a dog
And a abandoned puppy I found back in the rain back in 1998
She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I had anticipated
Once she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility that the plan from the East River Waterfront
Despite the fact that our small part of New York City was already handled more than 40% of the entire city's commercial waste, a sewage treatment, palatizing plant, a sewage sludge, plant for power plants, the world's largest food distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city
So when I was contacted by the parks department, about a $10,000 seed gran initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning but a bit naive
I lived in this area all my life and then you could not get to the river because of all of a lovely facilities that I had mentioned earlier
Then while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump
There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me and low and behold that the end of that lot was the river
I knew that this forgotten little street end, a ban and like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx
And just like my new dog, was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined
We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years
We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times into a $3 million park
And in the fall, I'm actually going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time
But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine
We feel the problem is right now and have for some time
Environmental justice for those of you who may not be familiar with the term goes something like this
No community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other
We're looking at the most important of the country's health
We're looking at the most important of the country's health
We're looking at the most important of the country's health
We're looking at the most important of the country's health
We're looking at the most important of the country's health
We're looking at the most important of the country's health
We're looking at the most important of the country's health
and asma
Why would someone leave their home to go for a risk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27% obesity rate is high even for this country and diabetes comes with it
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma
Asma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average
These impacts are coming everyone's way and we all paid dearly for solid waste costs
Health problems associated with pollution and more odiously
The cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men who possess untold amounts of of untap potential
50% of our residents live at or below the poverty line
25% of us are unemployed
Low-income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care
This comes in a high-cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits
Poor people are not only still poor, they are still healthy
Unfortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short-term and won't destroy us all in the long term
None of us want that and we all have that in common
So what else do we have in common? First of all, we're all incredibly good looking
Um
Graduated high school college, postgraduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens
Financialist table to never been imprisoned
Okay, good
But besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways
I watch nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burned down
My big brother, Lini, fought in Vietnam only to be gunned down a few blocks for the whole
Jesus, I grew up with a crackhouse across the street
Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto
These things make me different from you
But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community
and I'm in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice and the other
So how do things get so different for us? In the late 40s, my dad, a poem in port of Son of a slave, bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx
And a few years later, he married my mom
At the same, at the time, the community was a mostly white working class neighborhood
My dad was not alone
And it's others liked him pursued their own version of the American Dream White Flight that came common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country
Redlining was used by banks where in certain sections of the city, including hours, redeemed off limits to any sort of investment
Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than sell under those conditions
Dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding
Hunts Point was formerly a walk to work community
But now residents had neither work nor home to walk to
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems
In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in West Chester County to go to Manhattan
The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were raised
600,000 people were displaced
The common perception was that all he pints and pushes and prostitutes were from the South Bronx
And if you are told from your earliest days, that nothing good is gonna come from your community that is bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now my family's property was worthless
Say for the, it was our home and all we had
And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors, and friends along the way, was enough
Now why is a story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation, but gets Environmental degradation, which begins social degradation
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come, antiquated zoning and land use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood
Are these factors taken into consideration when land use policy is decided? What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify the local community goes through? This was planning in quotes that did not have our best interest in mine
Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning
That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the South Bronx
I wrote a one and quarter million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfall and esplanade with dedicated on street bike paths
Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, placement of waste and other facilities, which have done probably don't compromise the community's quality of life, they provide opportunities to be more physically active as well as local economic development, think bike shops, juice stands
We secure $20 million to build first phase projects
This is Lafayette Avenue, and that's redesigned by Matthews Nealson, Lascae, Barcatex
And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park right now, where's separated by about 25 feet of water, but this length will change that
And as we nurture the natural environment, it's abundance will give us back even more
We run a project called Bronx Ecological Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs, little by little we're seeding the area with green collar jobs, then that's both the people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment
The started expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it
during rush hour it goes virtually unused
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway
We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to reinvision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for park land, affordable housing, and local economic development
We also built the city's, New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices
Cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere
green roofs or soil and living plants
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban heat island effect, and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe
Greeners also retain up to 75% of rainfall, so they reduce the city's needs to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions, which incidentally are often located in environmental justice communities, like mine
And they provide habitat for our little friends
So, so cool
Anyway, the demonstration project a springboard for our own greener fenced-alation business, bringing jobs as a sustainable economic activity to the South-offs
I like that too
Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention, we need investors and of pitch it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission
Okay
Katrina
Pride of Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans, and Ithward had a lot in common
Both were largely populated by poor people of color
Both hotbeds of cultural innovation
Think hip hop and jazz
Both the waterfront communities that host both industries and residents and close proximity to one another
In the post-Catrina era, we have still more in common
We're at best ignored and maligned and abused at worse
By negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lacks governmental accountability
Neither the destruction of the knife-board nor the South Bronx was inevitable
But we have emerged with valuable lessons and about how to dig ourselves out
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of President's common gone
Now, we'll be let the Gulf Coast language for a decade or two like the South Bronx did, or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation out in communities like mine
Now listen, I do not expect individuals corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral
This representation today only represents some of what I've been through
Like a tiny little bit, you know, clue
I'll tell you later if you want to know
But I know it's the bottom line or one's perception of it that motivates people in the end
I'm interested in what I like to call the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produce
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concern, the developers, government, and the community where these projects go up
At present, that's not happening in New York City
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit
a parade of government subsidies is going to propose big box and stadium developments in the South Bronx
But there is a scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with a cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste, and the impacts on open space
And there approaches to local economic and job development are so lame
It's not even funny
But because on top of that, the richest, the world's richest sports team is replacing the the house that Ruth built by destroying two well-love community parks
Now we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier
And although less than 25% of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces yet zip in terms of public transit
Now what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fixing a unhealthy environment-leach-allege community versus incorporating structural sustainable changes
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues
Now, let's get this straight
I am not any development
I was just a city, not a wilderness preserve
And I've embraced my intercapitalists
And but I probably all have anything you need to
So I don't have a problem with developers making money
There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable community friendly development can still make a fortune
Former, you know, fellow techsters, Bill Madonna, and Amri Loveins both heroes of mine, by the way, you know, have shown that you can actually do that
I do have a problem with developments that hyper exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit that it continues is a shame upon us all because we're all responsible for the future that we create
But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities
This is my version of globalization
Let's take Bogota
Poor Latino surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking, a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx
However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique Benjelosa
He looked at the demographics
Few Bogotanios own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them
If you're a mayor, you can do something about that
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three outlawed parking on those streets
Expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes
Created public losses
Created one of the most efficient bus mass transit systems in the entire world
For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached
But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues, reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened, people stopped a littering, crime rates dropped because the streets were alive with people
His administration detects several typical urban problems at one time and on a third world budget at that
We have no excuse in this country
I'm sorry
But bottom line is, there are people for a agenda
Was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather to provide opportunities for all Bogotanios to participate in the city's researches
development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population
It's still considered a radical idea here in the US
But Bogotá's example has the power to change that
You, however, are blessed with a gift of influence
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange
Use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere
Don't just talk about it, it's head
This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build
as you all know, politics are personal
Help me make green the new black
Help me make sustainability sexy
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice
Support investments with a triple bottom line return
Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and assisting the comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere
Oh, good, glad I have a little more time
Listen, when I spoke to Mr
Gore, the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy
His response was a grant program
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding
I was making him an offer
We'll probably, was that this top down approach is still around
That don't get me wrong, we need money
But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process
of the 90% of the energy that Mr
Gore reminded us that we waste every day
Don't add wasting our energy intelligence and hard earned experience to that count
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
I have come from so far
To meet you like this, please don't waste me
But I work in the gather
We can become one of those small, rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world
We might have come to this conference from very, very different stages in life, but believe me
We all share one incredibly powerful thing
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain
Ciao, bello's
Thank you so much, Chris, and it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice
I'm extremely grateful
I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night
And I say that sincerely, partly because I need that
Put yourselves in my position
I flew on Air Force 2 for eight years
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane
I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me
This is a true story every bit of this is true
Soon after, Tip and I left the White House, we were driving from our home in the Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville, driving ourselves
I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but I looked in the rearview mirror and all All of a sudden it just hit me
There was no motorcade back there
You've heard of Phantom Lim pain
This was a rented Ford Tourist
It was dinner time
And we started looking for a place to eat
On I-40 we got to exit 238, 11 in Tennessee, we got off the exit start
Look what we found to show these restaurant
Locals, family restaurant, chain for those of you don't know it
We went in and sat down at the booth and the waitress came over, made a big emotion over, Tipper
She took our order and then went to the couple and then moved next to us and she lowered her voice so much I'd really strain to hear what she was saying
And she said, yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper
And the man said, he's come down a long way
He has
He's been kind of a series of epiphanys
The very next day, continuing a totally true story, I got on a G5 to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Legos on the topic of energy
And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you, to an hour driving ourselves, shoneys, low-cost family, restaurant, and what the man said
They laughed
I gave my speech and went back out to the airport to fly back home
I fell asleep on the plane, until during the middle of the night we landed on the Azores Islands for refilling
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air and I looked and there was a man running across the runway
He was waving a piece of paper and he was yelling, call Washington, call Washington
I thought to myself, the middle of the night middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington, I remember it could be a bunch of things
But what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech and it had already been printed in all across the United States of America's printed and Monterey at checked
And the story began, former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday, quote, My wife, Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant named Shonies, and we are running it ourselves
Before I could get back to US soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in
And one of them had me in a big white chef's hat
Chipper was saying, one more burger with fries
Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton saying, congratulations on the new restaurant out
We like to celebrate each other's successes in life
So you're going to talk about information ecology
But I was thinking that since I planned to make a lifelong habit of coming back to Ted, maybe I could talk about that another time
It's a deal
I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on
What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of, I'm going to show some new images and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five
Now, oh, the slideshow
I update the slideshow every time I give it, I add new images because I learn more about it every time I give it
It's like beach combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January
This is just for the United States of America
Starcoil average for January is the 31 degrees, last month was 39
5 degrees
Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment
I'm kidding
But these are the recapitulation slides
And then I'm going to go into a new material about what you can do
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these
First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the US contribution to global warming under business as usual
Efficiency in induced electricity and in-use of all energy is the low hanging fruit, efficiency and conservation
It's not a cost, it's a profit
The sign is wrong
It's not negative, it's positive
These are investments that pay for themselves, but they are also very effective in deflecting our path
Cars and trucks
I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective
It's an easy visible target of concern, and it should be, but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks
Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world
And so we should address that, but it's part of the puzzle
Other transportation is efficiency is as important as cars and trucks
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference and with what, uh, the vote and some, uh, and, uh, John Doran, others, many of you here, a lot of people directly involved in this, this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it
Carbon capture and sequestration, that's what CCS stands for, for is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe
Not quite there yet
Okay, now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home
Most of these expenditures are also profitable
Insulation, better design, buy green electricity, where you can
I mentioned automobiles, buy a hybrid, use light rail
Figure out some of the other options that are much better
It's important
Be a green consumer
You have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis
Consider this, make a decision to live a carbon neutral life
Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people
It is easier than you think
It really is
A lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy
It means it means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced
And what it means is elaborated at climate crisis
net
There is a carbon calculator
Participant productions convened with my active involvement, the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce
And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2
0, and we will have click through purchases of offsets
Next, consider making your business carbon neutral
Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think
Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture community
Invest sustainably
Majora mentioned this
Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, Don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management
Over time people do what you pay them to do
And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions
A lot more to be said about that
Become a catalyst of change, teach others, learn about it, talk about it
The movie comes out, the movie is a movie version of the slideshow that it gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining
And it comes out in May
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it
What are sending somebody to Nashville? Pick well
And I am personally going to train people to give this slide show, repurposed with some of the personal stories
Obviously, replace with a generic approach
It's not just the slides
It's what they mean and it's how they link together
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are are nominated by different folks to come and then give it in mass and communities all across the country and we're gonna update the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be somewhere in that process posted with tools and limited use copyrights so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way
Wait
Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arms links from politics? It doesn't mean that I'm trying to conv
if you were a Republican, then I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat
We need Republicans as well
This ought to be
you used to be a bipartisan issue
And I know that in this group, it really is
Become politically active
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work
the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions, global warming pollution, and trading it
Here's why
As long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system
Once it becomes a closed system with US participation, then everybody who's on a board of people here serves on the board of directors of a corporation
Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability If you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided, the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this
Help with a mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring
We have to change the minds of the American people because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done
In our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did
It's now repetition of short, hot, but in 30 second, 28 second television ads
We have to buy a lot of those ads
Let's rebrand global warming
As many of you have suggested, I like climate crisis instead of climate collapse
But again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb in a neocortex is a viable combination
That's really true
I said the other night and I'll repeat now, this is not a political issue
Again, the Republicans here, this shouldn't be partisan
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do
This is an opportunity not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them
We are one
Thank you very much, I appreciate it
