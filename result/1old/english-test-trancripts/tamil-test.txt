I still have this TV image in my mind
I could see people falling down
Gosh, I was so terrified
I really, I was crying a lot
Someone who knew my father and my mom grabbed my hand and he said, Let's go, let's go and I was like, where my mom, my mom, my mom, my mom
During nice wood here, shards, wood here, guns
Elections was supposed to happen
We had young people going to the street, they were having strides, and most of them people died
We bought a vehicle
It was overloaded
People were running for their lives
That is how I, if they from Somalia, my mom and me, nobody told her where I went
The fact that we did not go to school, We couldn't go to the market, we were just Stockholm, made me realize that if I got an option to go for something better, I could just go for it and have a better future
Global, it is placed people in the world that have been increasing
Now they are almost 60 million people displaced in the world
And unfortunately, it doesn't stop
I think the humanitarian community is starting to realize from research and reality that we're talking about a much more permanent problem
These students, they need a tertiary education a degree that they can use if the students are living now in Rwanda, if they get relocated, still they can continue their study
Still their degree is useful, whatever they are
Our audacious project was to really test Southern New Hampshire University's global education movements, ability to scale, to bring bachelor's degrees pathways to employment, to refugees and those who would otherwise not have access to higher education
It was almost impossible to do a refugee bus on to a father-made education and to make my career
My name is Saida Adenside and I am from Somalia
I was an alliance all when I came to Kakuma and I started going to school at 17
Now I am doing my bachelor degree with SNHU
My name is Nurea, I'm from the Sevee Damni
I'm doing my Bachelor of Arts in Communications with a concentration in business
We are serving students across five different countries, Lebanon, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, and South Africa
Really proud to have 800 AA grads to over 400 BAPSlers graduate and nearly a thousand students enrolled right now
So the magic of this is that we're addressing refugee lives as they exist
There are no classes, there are no lectures, there are no due dates, there are no final exams
This degree is competency-based and not time-bound
You choose when you start your project
You choose how you're going to approach it
When you open the platform, that's where you can see the goals
On their H goal, we can find projects
When you open a project, you get the competencies that you have to master, directions, and overview of the projects
The secret sauce of SNHU is combining that competency-based online learning with the in-person learning that we do with partners
To provide all the wraparone supports, that includes academic coaching
It means psychosocial support, medical support
And it's also that back at an employment support that's really resulting in the 95% graduation, the 88% employment
The decision-media management intern, it's related to the communications diagram doing
I've learned so many things out of the project and in the real world
The structured internship is really an opportunity for students to practice their skills
for us to create connections between that internship and a later job opportunity
This is a model that really stops putting time and university policies and procedures at the center and instead puts the student at the center
Yes, and the gym model is a big way to shake the three
Huge, is a huge shake today to the traditional way of having tertiary education here
It can transform the lives of students from this vulnerable and refugee communities
If I get the degree, I can just come back and work everywhere that I want, I can go from masters, confidently in English, which is something that I would not have dreamed of before
And I have the confidence and the skills required to actually go out and just talk to the workplace without having to fear that I can't make it
I always wanted to work with the community
I want to establish an unprofit
We advocate for women education
I want to be a someone who is like Ambasa, that encouraged them to learn and tell them it is never too late
It's a dream
June 8th, 2010
Russell Wilson, fourth round pick to the Kawaraki's baseball
I'm fired up when the highest moment of my life
Every kid's dream to be drafted by a Major League baseball team
June 8th, 2010
June 9th, 2010
The line goes flat
My dad passes away
High is the high to the lowest to the low
Just like that
My dad laying his death bed just tears running down my face and you know what I do next
And my mind racing memories, flashbacks, moments, early mornings getting up, taking grounders and throwing, speedouts and deep posts routes to my brother and my dad to early morning car rides to AU baseball to my dad being the third base coach
Fast forward to the championship high of winning a Super Bowl holding up the Lombardi trophy and then motions and excitement of it all and blew and green confetti all over the place and knowing that you just want the Super Bowl to a year later the pressure of the game and the ball and the one your online and this is the chance to win the game and it doesn't work and however many millions and millions of people all over the world watching and having to walk to the the median, what do I say next? What do I do? What do I think? Being married at a young age and just coming out of college and everything else to, you know, shortly after, you know, marriage is not working out and realizing, you know what life happens
Life happens, life happens to all of us
Lots of family members divorce, fear, pain, depression, concerns, worries
When you think about being super positive, yes, I'm positive by nature, but positivity, you know, it doesn't always work
because when you're down 16, nothing NFC championship game, if people are like Russ, we're not gonna be able to win this game, and it's not a great situation right now
When you're facing cancer, when you have things you have to deal with, or finances, and this and that, how do we deal with it? And it's hard to be positive in the midst of it all
And what I definitely knew was this, that negativity works a hundred percent of the time
Negativity was gonna get me nowhere
I start saying to myself, new or his mercies every morning, new beginnings, new starts, and despite hardship and pain worries and wanting to get through it and how do I do this? I started thinking about a car
You know you guys have drive a car and get stick shift and you want to shift to neutral
Well, you go from first year to second year all the way to fifth
Well, you got to know how to shift to neutral and I needed to shift to neutral immediately before I crashed
Sitting there after the Super Bowl, I had a decision to make
Well, I let this define my career well, I let it define my life
Hell no, but I found out was this
The mindset is a skill
It can be taught and learned
I started 10 years ago training my mind with this guy named Trevor Moe at my mental conditioning coach and he's been with me for 10 years and we've been best friends and partners ever since
And as athletes we train the body, we train ourselves to be able to run fast and throw farther and jump higher and do these different things
But why don't we train our mind? What do you want your life to look like? Write it out
You know, talk about it
Say it
What's our language? What does our language look like? Watch these highlights of us of when you're in your best moments
What does that look like and be that? Live that sound like that
The best free though shoes
They don't worry about the shot
They just miss they think about this shot
This put this throw this first down
Then I met this kid Milton Wright, 19 years old
He had cancer three different times this day when I went to see Milton Milton was frustrated
Well, so I'm done
I don't want to do this anymore
It's my time to go and I said Milton, and I start telling the story about my dad and how my dad used to say, son, why not you
Why not you graduate early? Why not you play a profile phone pro baseball? Why not you? Why not you? Why not you? Why not you? Why not you? It's a said Milton, why not you? If you try to self-terapy and you try this and it doesn't work, you know, you won't remember
So Milton got a smile on his face and he said, you know what? You're exactly right
Yes, I do have cancer, Russ
But I can either let this kill me, not just physically, like an also let it kill me emotionally and mentally
And I have a choice right now and the midst of the problem and the midst of the storm to decide to overcome
One of the questions I always get asked about neutral thinking is this, does that mean I don't have any emotion? I always say absolutely not
Yeah, we have emotions
We have real life situations
We have things to deal with
But what you have to be able to do is to stay focused on the moment and to not be super emotional
emotionally, it's okay to have emotions but don't be emotional
When people look at me, they see that on the highest paid player in the NFL, they see that I have the girl in Sierra, that I have the family and this and that, but I still have real life situations
We all do
We all have sadness and loss and depression and worries and fear
I didn't just get here
What's the truth? And how do I come through this better? And that's really kind of how my mindset at shifting was not just on the success of it all or the failure of it, it was on the process
Like, you know, what is the next step? How do I do this right here right now? You have a choice to make in life
And for me, when I was young and I didn't have much, I made a choice
I made a choice that I was going to believe that great things were going to happen, that I was going to have my mindset right
And now I was going to have the right language and the right things to think about, which helped prepare me for the day
because I'm just human
I just have ability to throw the ball a long way and run around and make some cool and fun throws and make some people smile
But the reality is that I still have pressure
I still have worries
I still have fears
I still have things that happen
It still have loss
Positiveity can be dangerous
But what always works is negativity
And never want to live in negativity
So I stayed in neutral
I kept my shift in neutral
And so that's why I lived
And that's where I've been living ever since
So I'd like to start if I may by asking you some questions
If you've ever lost someone you truly love, ever had your heart broken, ever struggled through an acrimonious divorce or been the victim of infidelity, please stand up
If standing up is inaccessible to you, you can put your hand up
please stay standing and keep your hand up there
If you've ever lived through a natural disaster, been bullied or been made redundant, stand on up
If you've ever had a miscarriage, if you've ever had an abortion, or struggle through infertility, please stand up
Finally, if you or anyone you love has had to cope with mental illness, dementia, some form of physical impairment or cope with suicide, please stand up
Look around you
Adversity doesn't discriminate
If you are alive, you are going to have to, or you've already had to, deal with some tough times
Thank you, everyone, take a seat
I started studying resilience research a decade ago at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
It was an amazing time to be there because the professors who trained me had just picked up the contract to train all 1
1 million American soldiers to be as mentally fit as they always have been physically fit
As you can imagine, you don't get a much more skeptical, discerning audience than the American drill sergeants returning from Afghanistan
So for someone like me who's made quest in life is trying to work out how we take the best of scientific findings out of academia and bring them to people in their everyday lives
It was a pretty inspiring place to be
I finished my studies in America and I returned home here to Christchurch to start my doctoral research
I just begun that study when the Christchurch earthquakes hit
So I put my research on holes and I started working with my home community to help them through that terrible post-quake period
I work with all sorts of organisations from government departments to building companies and also to community groups teaching them the ways of thinking and acting that we know boost resilience
I thought that was my calling
My moment to put all of that research to good use, but sadly I was wrong
my own true test came in 2014 on Queen's birthday weekend
We and two other families had decided to go down to Lake O'Hell and bike the ounce to ocean
At the last minute, my beautiful 12-year-old daughter Abby decided to hop in the car with her best friend Ella also 12, and Ellis Mumsali, a dear dear friend of mine
On the way down, as they traveled through a ricaire on Thompson's track, a car, sped through a stop sign, crashing into them, and killing all three of them instantly
In the blink of an eye, I find myself flung to the other side of the equation, waking up with a whole new identity
Instead of being the resilience expert, suddenly I'm the grieving mother, waking up, not knowing who I am, trying to wrap my head around unthinkable news, my world smashed to smithereens
Suddenly I'm the one on the end of all this expert advice, and I can tell you, I didn't like what I heard one little bit
In the days after Abbey died, We were told we were now prime candidates for family assangement that we were likely to get divorced and we were at high risk of mental illness
Wow, I remember thinking thanks for that
I thought my life was already pretty shit
Leave let's describe the five stages of grief, anger, bargaining, denial, depression, acceptance, victims of porter-rived adored and told us that we could expect to write off the next five years to grief
I know the leaflets and the resources meant well, but in all of that advice, they left us feeling like victims, totally overwhelmed by the journey ahead, and powerless to exert any influence over our grieving whatsoever
I didn't need to be told how bad things were
Believe me, I already knew things were truly terrible
What I needed most was hope
I needed a journey through all that anguish pain and longing
Most of all, I wanted to be an active participant in my grief process
So I decided to turn my back on their advice and decided instead to conduct something of a self-experiment
experiment
I'd done the research
I had the tools
I wanted to know how useful they were better me now in the face of such an enormous mountain to climb
Now I have to confess at this point
I don't really know any of this was going to work
Parental bereadment is widely acknowledged as the hardest of losses to bear
But I can tell you now five years on what I already knew from the research that you can rise up from adversity, that there are strategies that work, that it is utterly possible to make yourself think and act in certain ways that help you navigate tough times
There is a monumental body of research on how to do this stuff
Today I'm just going to share with you three strategies
These are my go-to strategies that I relied upon and saved me in my darkest days
Their three strategies to underpin all of my work and they're pretty readily available to us all
Anyone can learn them
You can learn them right here today
So number one, resilient people get that shit happens
They know that suffering is part of life
It doesn't mean they actually welcome mid-in
They're not actually delusional
Just that when the tough times come, they seem to know that suffering is part of every human existence
And knowing this, stops you from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come
Never once did I find myself thinking, why me? In fact, I remember thinking, why not me? Terrible things happen to you just like they do everybody else
That's your life now, time to sink or swim
The real tragedy is that not enough of us seem to know this any longer
We seem to live in an age where we're entitled to a perfect life, where shiny happy photos on Instagram are the norm when actually, as you all demonstrated at the start of my talk, the very opposite is true
Number two, resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where they select their attention
They have a habit of realistically appraising situations and typically managing to focus on the things that they can change and somehow accept the things that they can't
This is a vital, learnable skill for resilience
As humans, we are really good at noticing, threats and weaknesses
We are hard-wired for that negative
We're really, really good at noticing them
Negative emotions stick to us like Velcro, crow, whereas positive emotions and experiences seem to bounce off like teflon
Being wide in this way is actually really good for us and served us well from an evolutionary perspective
So imagine for a moment I'm a cave woman and I'm coming out of my cave in the morning and there's a Saber 2 tiger on one side and a beautiful rainbow on the other
It kind of pays for my survival for me to notice this tiger
The problem is, we now live in an era where we are constantly bombarded by threats all day long, and our poor brains treat every single one of those threats, as though they were a tiger
Our threat focus, our stress response is permanently dialed up
people don't diminish the negative but they also have worked out a way of tuning into the good
One day when doubts were threatening to overwhelm me, I distinctly remember thinking, no, you do not get to get swallowed up by this, you have to survive, you've got so much to live for
Choose life, not death
Don't lose what you have to what you have lost
In psychology we call this benefit finding
In my brave new world it involves trying to find things to be grateful for
At least our we go hadn't died of some terrible long drawn out illness, she died suddenly, instantly, sparing us and her that pain
We had a huge amount of social support from family and friends to help us through
And most of all, we still had two beautiful boys to live for, who needed us now and deserve to have as normal a life as we could possibly give them
able to switch the focus of your attention to also include the good has been shown by science to be a really powerful strategy
So in 2005, Marty Seligman and colleagues conducted an experiment and they asked people, all they asked people to do was think of three good things that had happened to them each day
What they found over the six months course of this study was that those people showed higher levels of gratitude, higher levels of happiness and less depression over the course of the six-month study
When you're going through grief, you might need a reminder, well you might need permission to feel grateful
In our kitchen we've got a bright pink neon poster that reminds us to accept the good
In the American Army they framed it a little bit differently
They taught to to the army about hunting the good stuff
Find the language that works for you, but whatever you do, make an intentional, deliberate, ongoing effort to tune into what's good in your world
Number three, resilient people ask themselves, is what I'm doing, helping or harming me
This is a question that's used a lot in good therapy
And boy, is it powerful? This was my go-to question in the days after the girls died
I would ask it again and again
Should I go to the trial and see the driver? Would that help me? Or would it harm me? Well, that was a no-brainer for me
I chose to stay away
But Trevor, my husband, decided to meet with the driver at a later time
Later at night, I'd find myself sometimes pouring over old photos of Abbey getting more and more upset, I'd ask myself, really, is this helping you? Or is it harming you? Put away the photos, go to bed for the night, be kind to yourself
This question can be applied to so many different contexts, is the way I'm thinking enacting, helping a harming you in your bid to get that promotion, to pass that exam, to recover from a heart attack so many different ways
I write a lot about resilience and over the years, this one strategy has prompted more positive feedback than any other
I get scores of letters and emails and things from all over the place of people saying, what a huge impact it's had on their lives
Whether it is forgiving, family, ancient, transgressions, arguments from Christmas's past Whether it is just trawling through social media, whether it is asking yourself whether you really need that extra glass of wine, asking yourself whether what you're doing, the way you're thinking, the way you're acting is helping our harming you, puts you back in the driver's seat
It gives you some control over your decision-making
Three strategies, pretty simple
They're readily available to us all anytime, anywhere
They don't require rocket science
Resilience isn't some fixed trait
It's not a lucid that some people have and some people don't
It's actually requires very ordinary processes, just the willingness to give them a go
I think we all have moments in life where our life past splits, and the journey we thought we were going down, say some terrible fears of some terrible direction that we never anticipated and we certainly didn't want
It happened to me
It was awful beyond imagining
If you ever find yourself in a situation where you think, there's no way I'm coming back from this, I urge you to lean into these strategies and think again
I won't pretend that thinking this way is easy and it doesn't remove all the pain
But if I've learned anything over the last five years, it is that thinking this way really does help
More than anything, it is shown me that it is possible to live and grieve at the same time
And for that, I will be always grateful
Thank you
So here we are
I'm at home as I'm sure many of you are too
And we've all begun to understand how our relationship with ourselves, with each other and the spaces we exist in can deeply impact our sense of identity and purpose
So much has dramatically changed
There's a sense of distance now unlike ever before
For what if I told you that you could find a way from your heart to your hand to reconnect again
And that through this practice and embracing this pause, I could help you to recalibrate your mind so that you could explore this new reality with joy, enthusiasm, imagination and hope
And all it would take is a simple pen
To get you there, let's go back to the beginning
As a kid growing up in a council state in southeast London, I was an outsider
I'm the oldest of six kids, all of my siblings are very English, blonde hair, blue eyes, very cute
And then there was me, half Nigerian brown with an afro
So what happens when you look different and you feel different? And in many ways, start to think differently from everyone and everything around you
How do you find your way out of a dark racist, homophobic and very lonely place? This is where the pen comes in
I started to draw
So as you can see I've got this pen and it knows where it's going
And I've learned very well how to follow it
And the first thing I did is I followed this line and I drew myself out of a culture that was only telling me what I couldn't do
I trusted my pen and it led me to central Saint Martin's, a very fancy art school in London where I graduated top of my year
However, I soon realized there wasn't a place for me in London
Because wherever you wish to believe it or not, England is still a country that is rooted and functions within the class system
And there's a young, black, gay, female artist from a working class family
I didn't stand the chance
My left London and I moved to Japan, where I didn't experience people asking me where I was really from
I was just another guy, which I ironically means outside
I was immersed in the culture that honours both making and craft, where people perfect their craft over generations
It's a culture that masters both time and space so that artists can truly create with freedom
And what I discovered was a place I wasn't angry with
Tokyo hadn't wronged me in any way
I could no longer create with anger or out of pain
I had to bravely allow myself to create from a different place
And what I found is this incredible tour transcended a line on paper
I found this thing that connected my head to my heart and my hand to everything
I could see the world in new ways
I found connections and corners and the solutions to problems I never knew existed
It's like the world with always positive and negative spaces could now be seen
And just by seeing it, there was no longer any fear
It's like my pen was a flashlight and the unknown was still there, but it wasn't scary
After five years of living in Japan and focusing on my craft, I felt like I needed a new challenge
So I moved to New York because that's what you do as an artist, right? You move to the greatest city in the world, has the ability to make you feel completely and utterly invisible
This is when I began to truly ask myself, who are you? I would wake up in the morning and before I began my day, I would meditate on this
And with this question in mind, I kept drawing
I followed the line, I let it lead the way
The process of picking up a pen, Something everyone has access to
The act of giving myself permission to let go of all thoughts, all fears, insecurities, any thing that we're getting away or allowing myself to be completely me
That became my way of experiencing freedom
When I got to New York, I didn't want to play by the rules of the art world
I continued my practice as an outsider
I kept drawing
Curie Oceti became the ink from my pen, and I continued to dive deeper
Over time, I began to create a bold, confident space for myself, a space that was all my own
Initially, it was just my bedroom
But that bedroom ended up in the New York Times
And suddenly, I was being seen and known for this world I had created
Since then, I've created and collaborated with some of the most unique artists, institutions, spaces from the screens of time square to the New York City Ballet for their incredible artist series where I interviewed a number of dancers
Their stories and words became the foundation of over 30 drawings and artworks which took over the promenade walls, windows and floors
For a long time I wanted to create a space for contemplation and poetry
In 2019, I was given the opportunity to do just that by the trust of Governor's island
They provided me with the perfect canvas in the form of a former military chapel
Meet the Maveram
We've drawings on the exterior, inspired by the history of the island
You walk inside, you take your shoes off, and there's a drawing on the floor in a form of a maze that brings you back to you
It's an invitation to become calm and this allows you to see phrases on the wall
May you be wise
May you sleep soundly at night
May we save trees
May you, may you, may we
And these phrases seem like they're rising from you or falling into you
I've let my lines become much like a language
A language that has unfolded much like life
And when there has been silence, I've sought connection for conversation
I've asked questions to push through the discomfort
Drawing has taught me how to create my own rules
It has taught me to open my eyes and see not only what is, but what can be
And where there are broken systems, we can create new ones that actually function and benefit all, instead of just a select few
Drawing has taught me how to fully engage with the well
what I've come to realise through this language of lines, it's not the importance of being seen, but rather the gift of seeing that we give to others
And how true freedom is the ability to see and I don't mean that literally because sight is only one way in which one can see, but what I mean is to experience the world in its entirety
Maybe even more so during the most challenging moments like the one we face today
I'm Shantar Martin, I draw and I invite you to pick up a pen and see where it takes you
All right, I have a close tightness circle of friends
We're all in different cities, and we're all in different areas
From local news to city government to law financial services
And despite those different areas, we see in the shared similar stories of workplace drama
Now, I define workplace trauma as an annoyance that adds additional stress to the job
So again, this one, people get all your nerves, not the job itself
So as we're going through these stories, I'm realizing there has to be a better way for us to coexist with our coworkers without this much drama
So I created a few steps that have been working for me, and I'm happy to share with you guys today
Step one, rewind and reflect
Also known as, what did I do? I want you guys to all replay your most recent workplace drama situation in your head like a movie
Ignore all the emotion and just focus on you
But for now let's just think about this hypothetical
So you're on a group project
You each have your own individual assignments and then you you all divide up the work, but then someone becomes unresponsive
Not answering calls, they go ghost
Then you or someone else has to now pick up that additional slack
So in a brief, small, very tiny, laps in judgment, you've been to the nearby coworker
Then all of a sudden your ghost comes back and they surprisingly know everything you just said
Now what did I do in this situation? I went into someone who was not my confidant
Why would I do that? Sometimes we create this unscoken bond with people that only exist in our heads
They don't owe me their discretion
I just assumed it was there
So we're not going to go down the rabbit hole and try to figure out why they did that
It doesn't matter
They did it
But the goal in this step is self-reflection
We need to focus on what did we do so we can avoid it in the future
Step two, come back to reality
Also known as, in a stop
Okay? So you guys ever think about problems before you get to work? Oh, it's just me? Okay
Well, I'm guilty of it
I think about all of these situations in my head and then I get mad just thinking about it
So I'm telling myself, no, you're just being prepared, Stacy
You are just making sure that you can handle whatever they're about to throw at you
But you're not
What you're really doing is setting yourself up and creating this anxiety in your head
That doesn't exist
Then we also have to be careful about listening that other people's made-ups in areas
Here's what I mean
Let's say you're in the break room and you're talking to some co-workers
Then all of a sudden, I know the coworker comes in
Now, they seem to just be in deep thought, not overly cheerful, but they're not rude
They come in, they walk out
Then the coworker's over here begins to diagnose what they feel is wrong with that person
They're saying things like, oh, there's just mad
They didn't get the job
Or they're saying, oh, no, no, no, no
They're in this season
They're just always upset
And you're sitting here like, yep
I must be it
You're listening to this as if this is facts
Meanwhile, this coworker can be in deep thought about literally anything
They can just open a pack of stabbards, got four yellows back to bet, and then just try to figure out what happened
But you're over here listening
And you're listening to their made-up scenario that now can impact how you choose to interact with that person throughout the day
Whether we're creating fake stories in our head or listening to other people made up stories, it needs to stop
The goal and the step, stop stressing over things that haven't happened
All right, step three, vent and release
It's good to have a vent buddy
This is your coach, yet cheerleader, your therapist, whatever you need them to be in the moment
This is not like that person is stuff one that just happened to be an ear side
You have an established relationship with your event body
Now here's another scenario
You're getting ready to tell a customer client, something that they just don't want to hear
So as you're in the middle of the spill, upcomes another coworker, and they interrupt you
and then says the exact same thing you were saying
So you can't make a scene in front of a customer
You just, so you got to sit back and just listen
As they do this, and you're burning up inside
So what do we do? We go to our vet buddy
We talk about it, we get mad
And that's the time for that, get mad
Get angry, curse, scream to whatever you need to do to get it out
Now here's the hard part
you then have to switch that tone to positivity
I truly believe in positive and negative energy, and it has a way of controlling our moods throughout the day
You gotta think of things like, okay, where do I go from here? What can I do differently? And then if you're the vet buddy, is your responsibility to lead your friend back to the positive? Now the other hard part, You have to then apply those learnings to the situation
You can't carry that resentment around
If you do that one-off situation now becomes a pattern
Pattern behavior is harder to ignore than a one-off situation
The goal in this step is let's turn our productive vint session, well, let's turn our vint session into a productive conversation
That for learn a new language
Also known as, we need to talk
Guys, I personally don't like to pick up the phone at work
I just don't
I feel like whatever you need to say to me can be an instant message or an email
That is my work language
The only problem with that, you can't hear tone through an email
So I read emails the same way I speak
Some pretty sure I misinterpreted some tone before
Unless I know you
So here's an example
I'm going to show you guys an email, and I want you to read it, and then I'm a read it out loud
All right, that was fast enough
You should have read it
Stacy, thank you for reaching out about my group
At this time, we will not need any additional support
Going for it
If I feel we need help, I'll ask you to have to reach out
Permaless email, a text below
I've outlined what I do and what you do, so I can avoid this in the future
As always, thank you for your partnership
Guys, that's how you read it
Because there are certain words in there that if you hear or if you see in an email, it is safe to assume they typed it with their middle fingers
I didn't know of it
I know it now
I think I messed up some people's emails, they're correcting now
With all that said, you have to know when it is time to pick up the phone
You have to know when it is time to have a face to face
In these face-to-face conversations are not easy
They are difficult, but they are necessary
The goal is to try to understand the other person's perspective
So you'll start the conversation with things like, okay, you got upset when I, or you'll say things like, okay, you already had the situation handled, and then I, so that way you can see exactly where they're coming from
Also, don't try to make people like you
We all have our own upbrings
We all have our own experiences, and we all have our own communication styles
As the new generations are entering the workforce, we're also adapting to it
Meetings are now emails, emails are now text
All sites are now Skype
So as we're adjusting to that, we need to at least try to understand what type of style of communication they use
The goal in that step is to really understand their work language and accept the fact that it may be different than yours
Step five, recognize and protect
Also known as, we need to take a walk
So here's my last scenario for one of our teacher friends
You're about to have a meeting with the parent
and prior to it, you and a coworker, you kind of discussed it
And the coworker tells you, this is all right, I got your back
I'm gonna agree with your recommendations
So you're kind of sad I know, because they burned you before, but you've had that we need to talk
So you're like, we're in sync now, I'm gonna trust them
You go through the meeting, the parents disagrees with you, and like clockwork, the coworker agrees with the parent in front of you, making you look ridiculous
So you just, again, we can't make a scene in front of people, right? So we've got to hold it in
And then after the meeting, that same coworker has all the audacity comes up to you as it cries in needing, right? Yeah
They're testing you now
This is the test
So that's the perfect time to just go off, right? This is the repeat off, Finder
You'll walk the way and they came back with it
But we're trying to avoid workplace drama, not take a cannonball leap into it
So we have to walk away
You leave that conversation by taking the first available exit
You're not doing this for them
You're doing this for you
You have to protect your energy
Don't try to figure out why they would do this
And no more coming to Jesus conversations
It is what it is
They did what they did and given the opportunity
they'd probably do it again
But you now know that
You now recognize that so that way you can act accordingly
We typically try to set expectations, our expectations on other people, and then get disappointed when they don't follow through
We have to learn to accept people where they are, and I just ourselves to handle those situations
The goal in this step is to recognize when it is time to professionally walk away from someone
Guys, I realize these steps may come off as saying take the high road
And people always say, just take the high road
And they describe it as some elegant path of righteousness filled with rainbows and unicorns
It's not that
It's embarrassing
It's humiliating
It leaves this not of resentment in the pit of your stomach
And as you're traveling down this amazing high road, you see billboards, the things you should have said, and things you should have did
You go over there, you look at the easy road, and they're telling, Now, we're at about a thing
But I have to admit, the more I travel down this road, it does get a little easier
Petty situations, they don't bother me as much
I learn little nuggets here and there
And as I continue down this path, there seems to be more opportunities waiting for me
I have like minded people who want to connect with me
projects that people want me on, leaders reaching out because they heard about me through someone else
In the best part, the needs that even look at the easy road is no longer there
Guys, we're not going to change the way adults act in the workplace
We are not
If for that reason, there will always be workplace drama
But if we stick to these steps and put in the work that comes with it, we can learn to avoid it
Guys, thank you for being my vet buddies
And thank you so much for your time
At the Temple of the Fisherman, Kexo, the village shaman, looks out over the ocean and frowns
It's a still morning, unusually still, and the lack of wind is the latest in a series of troubling signs
The year is 1400 BCE
Kexo's village sits in the dusty, treeless desert between the towering andes and Pacific Ocean
The villagers live off the sea, harvesting reads, drying them in the sun, and using them to build fishing boats
Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats to hunt shark and other fish, while the women harvest shellfish and sea urchants
In winter storms bring powerful waves, which cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores
years, Kexo's village catches more than enough fish
But this year, the winds have died and the fish have dwindled
Kexo has seen this pattern before
The fish disappear, then the violent rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve mud bricks and wash away settlements
He needs to stop the bad weather before the storm's come
His only hope is a special ritual he's been planning
Kexo spends much less time in the ocean than the other villagers
He became a shaman after seeing a sign in the sea one morning, like his father and grandfather before him
This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain as the sun rises
They are, he gathers ceremonial cactus and herbs like horse tail, stonebreaker, and Valerian, along with the mineral hematide
Back in the village, everyone is preparing to leave for a religious festival at a large temple inland
The festival marks the beginning of what is usually the season of abundance, but with the science pointing to storms, Kexo isn't feeling too celebratory
Whole families travel to the festival where they can't for a few days
They've packed seaweed, carved bones, gold bowls, readmats, and other goods to trade in the market around the temple
Kexo inspects the goods to make sure everything is of the finest quality
He brings the herbs he gathered to trade for Sinabar, a mineral that comes from the Highlands in the Andes
He needs Sinabar for his ritual to ward off the storms
Around lunchtime, the sprawling temple rises out of the desert ahead
People have come from all along the coast and the foothills, the women handle trade transactions, they're looking for cotton and ceramics
Men aren't usually allowed to do the trading, but shamans are an exception
Though Kexo is a man, during rituals, he becomes half-man, half-woman, and this ambiguity makes his role more flexible outside ceremonies too
Kexo can't find any Sinobar in the market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza
He puts on his ceremonial garb, red face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark's teeth and vertebrae
Inside, the ceremonies are already underway, and the shamans have drunk the sacred cactus drink
Many of them are kexos friends from festivals over the years, but he doesn't see the mountain shamans who would have Sinobar
He begins to panic
If the Highland shamans don't show up, his only option will be to make the long walk into the mountains
It's a dangerous journey that takes five days
Precious time he doesn't have to waste
But perhaps he has no choice
He refuses the sacred cactus and sets off toward the mountains
As he leaves the settlement behind, he sees a group approaching
He recognizes them as highlanders by their llamas
He dashes toward their shaman, barely pausing to say hello, he offers him hemitite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime and chew with Coca leaves
In return, the other shaman gives him the precious cinnabar
With the key to his ritual in hand, Kexo heads home to the temple of the fisherman in hopes of turning the tide
Hello, take community, welcome back for another live conversation
It's a big one today, it's biggest they get
You know, when we created this build-back better series, I thought was how could we address issues arising out of the pandemic, how we imagine building back from that
But the events of this past week, the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that have followed, I mean they provided a new urgency which we have possibly have to address
I mean can we build back better from this? I think before we can even start to answer that question, we just have to see to understand the the immensity of this moment
Yeah, that's right, Chris
Right now, so many people in the United States and beyond are grappling with feelings of anger, and frustration, deep sadness, and really helplessness
No matter who you are, you have questions about what to do now, how to make things better
And as we've seen violence like this unfold for many, many years, what is the path forward? So we're joined today by a group of activists, organizers and leaders, known for their crucial work in social justice and civil rights
We're so grateful to have them here to engage in a discussion about racial injustice in America, the unbearable acts of violence that we've, the acts of violence against the black community that we've witnessed
The dangers to a nation, driven by anger and fear, and how an Earth we can move forward from this to something better
So first, each of our four guests will share their thoughts on how we move forward from this moment, and then we'll engage group including you the tech community
And we'd like to thank our partner, the Project Management Institute, their generous support has helped make today's interviews possible
And of course, as Chris mentioned, we want you to take part in the conversation
So please share your questions using our Ask a Question feature and continue to share your thoughts in the discussion thrive
Thanks, Wendy
Okay, let's get this moving, I first guessed
Dr
Philip Atuber, Garth is the founder of the Centre for Police in Equity
They work with police departments across America, including in Minneapolis, to seek measurable responses to racial bias
So I can, skeestly imagine, have a stress in the last week, must have been for you
Welcome and over to your field opening comments
Thanks, Chris
Yeah, this week has been a gut punch to anybody who felt like we could be making progress in the way that we put forward public safety that empowers particularly vulnerable communities
We started working in Minneapolis about five years ago
At the time, it was like most major cities in the United States, a department that had a long history of unaccounted for violence, from law enforcement targeting the most vulnerable black communities
And we tried to put into place a number of things that we know work
change the culture so that the culture can be accountable to the values of the community
And what we saw was small, but measurable progress
We always knew with small and measurable progress that you're one tragic incident from going back to ground zero
But the events of the last week and a half haven't brought us back to ground zero, they've torched ground zero and we've dug a hole
We have to dig ourselves out of
What I hear from police chiefs who call me from activists I talk to from folks in the communities that are on literally on fire right now
I hear folks saying I had one act of a say to me that the pain that he was feeling was too large defeated to his body
Without thinking about it I said right back that's That's because it's too large to fit into a lifetime
What we're seeing isn't just the response to one, gruesome, cruel, public execution, a lynching
It's not just the reaction to three of them, a mod, a bri, reanotailer, and then George Floyd
What we're seeing is the bill come due for the unpaid debts that this country owes to its black residents
And it comes due usually every 20 to 30 years
It was first in just six years ago, about 30 years before that, it was in the streets of Los Angeles after the verdict that exonerated the police that beat Rodney King on video
It was Newark, it was Wants, it was Chicago, it was Tulsa, it was Chicago again
If we don't take a full accounting of these debts that are owed, then we're going to keep paying it
Part of what I've been experiencing in the last week and a half, and what I've been sharing with the people who do this work, who are serious about it, is the acknowledgement, the soul crushing reality that at some point when things stop being on fire, the cameras are going to turn to something else
And the history that we have in this country is not just a history of vicious neglect and a targeted use of black communities
It's also one where we lose our attention for it
And what that means for communities like in Baton Rouge, where those who still grieve Altman Sterling, and in Baltimore for those who are still grieving for any gray is that there is not just a chance there's a likelihood that we are a month or two months out from this with no more to show for it than what we had to show after Michael Brown Jr
And holding the weight of that individually and collectively is just too much
is just too heavy-load for a person or a people or a generation to hold up
What we're seeing is the unrepentant sense, the unpaid debts
And so the solution can't just be that we fix policing
It can't be only incremental reform
It can't be only systems of accountability to catch cops after they've killed somebody
because there's no such thing as justice for George Floyd
There's maybe accountability
There's maybe some relief from the people who are still around who loved him for his daughter, who spoke out yesterday and said, my daddy changed the world
There won't be justice for a man who's dead when he didn't have to be
But we're not gonna get to where we need to go just by reforming police
So in addition to the work that CPE is known for with the data, we have been encouraging departments and cities to take the money that should be going to invest in communities, and take it from police budgets, bring it to the communities
People ask, well, what could it possibly look like? How could we imagine it? And I tell people, there is a place where we do this in the United States right now
We've all heard about it, whispered some of us have even been there, some of us live there
The place is called the suburbs
where we already have enough resources to give to people so they don't need the police for public safety in the first place
If someone has a substance abuse issue, they can go to a clinic
If somebody has a medical issue, they can go, they've gotten sure if they can go to a hospital
If there's a domestic dispute, they have friends and they have support
You don't need to enter a badge and a gun into it
If we hadn't disinvested from all the public resources that were available in communities that most needed those, we wouldn't need police in the first place
And then you have been arguing, even more loudly, recently, that we don't
if we would just take the money that we use to punish and instead invest it in the promise and the genius of the community that could be there
So I don't know all the ways we're going to get there
I know it's going to take everything in
It's going to need the kind of systemic change and the management tools that we traditionally offer
It's also going to need a quantum change in the way that we think about public safety
But mostly this isn't just a policing problem
This is the unpaid debts that are owed to Black America
The bill is coming due and we need to start getting an accounting together so we're not just paying off the interest of the damn thing
Thank you Phil
The next question is the president of color change
It's a civil rights organization that advocates for racial justice for the black community
Today more than four million people have signed their petition to arrest the officers involved in the murder of George Floyd
And of course one was arrested last week
Thank you so much for being with us for a shot
Welcome
Thank you
And thank you for having me
It's an opportunity that I'm taking today to just tell you about how you can get involved
how you can take action and because right now strategic action is critical for all of us to do the work to change the rules that far too often keep the systems in place that hold us back, make, no mistake
The criminal justice system is not broken
It is operating exactly the way it was designed
At every single level, the criminal justice system is not about providing justice
But about ensuring that certain people, certain communities are protected while other communities are violated
And so I want to talk a little bit today about color of change, about activism, about the work that's happening on the ground from other organizations, or all around the country
And the way that you can channel this energy, when we talk about color of change is how do you channel presence into power? And far too often we must take presents and disability for power, presents, retweets, the stories of the movement, people feeling passion about change
Can sometimes make us feel like change is inevitable, but power is actually the ability to change the rules
And right now, every day people are taking action and what we're trying to channel that energy into is a couple of things
First is a whole set of demands at the federal level and at the local level
has filled, described, that policing, you know, operates on many different channels
And what we need to recognize is that, while there are a lot of things that can happen at the federal level, locally all around the country, there are decisions that are being made in communities around how policing is executed
Where community needs to hold a deeper level of accountability at the state level, we knew new laws
So at color of change, we built a whole platform around a set of demands that are working to build more energy of everyday people to take action
We're fighting for justice for a mod robbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd
We're also fighting for justice for other folks whose names that you haven't heard, Nina Pop and others, whose stories of injustice and the relationship to the criminal justice system represent all the ways in which fighting right now is important
Over the last couple of years, we have worked to build a movement to hold district attorneys accountable and to change the role of district attorneys in our country
And through the winning justice platform at color of change, www
winningjustis
org, what we have worked to do is channel the energy of everyday people to take action
So for folks who are watching what's happening on TV, seegner on their social media feeds and are outraged about what's happening in Georgia, what's happening in Tennessee, what's happening in Minnesota, you yourself, probably most likely, live in a place in a community where you have a district attorney that will not hold police accountable, that will not prosecute police when they harm her, black folks when they violate the laws, you live in a community where police are part of the structure that is racking up mass incarceration, but many other aspects of our system are racking up in cars, mass incarceration, and district attorneys are at the center of it
You live in those communities and you need to do something about it
And so at winning justice
org, we've created the only searchable, national database on the 2400 prosecutors around the country
We're building local squads and communities for folks to be able to engage around on efforts to hold DAs accountable
We've worked with our partners across the movement from our friends and Black Lives Matter to folks who are due policy work to our friends at local ACLU chapters around the country to build six demands, six demands that folks can get behind in terms of pushing for reform and then we build public education material
But the only way that we work to change the way the prosecution happens in this country is that if people get involved, if people raise their voice, if people join us in pushing for real change
At the end of the day, I want people to recognize though and feel it talked a little bit about this
Is that people don't experience issues they experience life? That the forces that hold us back are deeply interrelated, racist, criminal justice system requires a racist media culture to survive
Political inequality follows economic inequality, they all go hand in hand
And so I also want us to not take ourselves of the equation
We likely work inside of corporations that may post symbols for black lives matter one day and then support politicians that work to destroy black lives matter the next day
We oftentimes are engaged in practices inside of our companies, our daily lives, supporting media properties and others that are harming our communities, our telling stories
Recently, we produced a report at color of change with the Norman Lears School at USC
It's called normalizing injustice, and it can be found that change Hollywood
org
And normalizing injustice looks at the 22 crime procedures, those crime shows on TV, and looks at all of the ways in which they sort of create a worked perception about our view of justice
They create sort of an incentive for the type of policing we see on the country and actually serve as a PR arm for law enforcement
We've been working in writers rooms around the country to work to push folks to tell better stories, but we need folks to be both active listeners and we need folks in the industry to push back and challenge those not only the structures that lead to that content coming on the air, but the proliferation across our airweaves
At the end of the day, we have an opportunity in this moment to make change
And flexion points are those moments where we have an opportunity to make huge leaps forward or the real threat of falling backwards
In our hands is the ability to do some incredible things about undoing so many of the injustices that have stood in the way of progress for far too long
But every day people must get involved
We must challenge, channel that presents, I'm into power, and we must build the type of power that changes the rules
Racism in so many ways is like water pouring over a floor with holes in it
Every single, in every single way it will find the holes
And so for us, we cannot simply accept charitable solutions structural problems, but we actually have to work for structural change
And so I want to end by saying one thing about how we talk about black people and how we talk about black communities in this moment, because we have to say what we mean and we have to build the narrative that gets us to where we want to go
So far too often we talk about black communities as vulnerable
We talk about black people as vulnerable, but vulnerability is a personal trait
Black communities have been under attack
communities have been exploited
Black communities have been targeted and we need to say that
So we don't put the onus on fixing black families and black communities, but we put the onus on fixing the structures that have harmed us
We will say things like black people are less likely to get loans from banks instead of saying that banks are less likely to give loans to black people
This is our opportunity to build the type of progress that makes real change
And at that center of the story, we need to show and elevate the images not just of the pain that that we are facing, but of the joy, the brilliance, and the creativity that black people have brought to this country
Black people are the protagonist of this story, and we need to make sure that as we work to build a new tomorrow, we ensure that the heroes are at the center of the liberation that we all need
Thank you
Thank you, Rashad
Dr
Bernie's King is the CEO of the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia
The center is a living memorial to her father, Dr
Martin Luther King, Jr
It's dedicated to inspiring new generations to carry his work forward
In this moment when so many are hurting, how can we better approach unity and collective He'll hear
Dr
King over to you
My heart is a little heavy right now because I was that six year old
I was five years old with my father was assassinated and he did change the world
But the tragedy is that we didn't hear what he was saying to us as a the prophet to his destination
And his words are now reverberating back to us
Change, we all know is necessary right now
And yet it's not easy
We know that there has to be changes in policing in this nation of ours
But I wanna talk about America's choice at a greater level
The prophet said to us, we still have a choice today, nonviolent coexistence or violent co-anulation
What we have witnessed over the last eight days has placed that choice before us
We have seen literally in the streets of our nation
who have been following the path of nonviolent protests and people who have been held bit on destruction
Those choices are not looking at us and we have to make a choice
The history of this nation was founded in violence
In fact my father said America is the greatest perveyor of violence
And the only way forward is if we repent for being a nation built on violence
And I'm not just talking about physical violence
I'm talking about systemic violence
I'm talking about policy violence
I'm talking about what he's focused on, the triple equals of poverty, racism, and militarism
All violent
violent
Albert Einstein said something to us
He said, we cannot solve problems on the same level of thinking in which they were created
And so if we are going to move forward, we are going to have to deconstruct the systems of violence that we have said America, and we're going to have to reconstruct on another foundation
That foundation happens to be love and nonviolence
And so as we move forward, we can correct course if we make that choice that Daddy said nonviolent coexistence and not continue on the pathway of violent correlation
So what does that look like? That looks like some deconstruction work in order to get to the construction
We have to deconstruct our thinking
We got to deconstruct the way in which we see people and deconstruct the way in which we operate, practice, and engage, and set policy
And so I believe that there's a lot of heart ATART work to do in the midst of all the ATARD hard work to do because heart work is hard work
One of the things we have to do is we have to ensure that everyone, especially my white brothers and sisters, have to engage in the heart work, the anti-racism work in our hearts
No one is exempt from this, especially in my white community
We must do that work in our hearts, the anti-racism work
The second thing is that I encourage people to look at the non-violence training that we've the King Center, the King Center about org
So that we learn the foundation of understanding our interrelatedness and interconnectedness
That we understand our loyalty, and our commitments, and our policy making can no longer be devoted to one group of people, but has to be devoted to the greater good of all people
And so I'm inviting people to even join us on our online protests that's happening every night at 7 o'clock PM on the King's Center Facebook page because so many people have things that they want to express and contribute to this
We all have to change and have to make a choice
It is a choice to change the direction that we have been going
We need a revolution of values in this country
That's what my daddy said
He changed the world
He changed hearts
And now what has happened over the last seven, eight years through history, we have to change course
And we all have to participate in changing America with a true revolution of values where people are at the center and not profit
When morality is at the center and not our military might, America does have a choice
We can even choose to go down continually that path of destruction or we can choose non-vile it coexistence
And as my mother said, struggle is never ending process
Freedom is never really warm
You earn it and win it in every generation
Every generation is called to this freedom struggle
You as a person may want to exempt yourself, but every generation is called
And so I encourage corporations in America to start doing anti-racism work within corporate America
I encourage every industry to start doing anti-racism work and pick up the banner of understanding nonviolent change personally and from a social change perspective
We can do this
We can make the right choice to ultimately build the a love community
Thank you
Thank you, Dr
King
And the Eramaro is the Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union
As one of the nation's oldest social justice organizations, the ACLU has advocated for racial equality and should deep support to the Black community in moments of crisis
And in moments like these Black voices are almost always the loudest and at times the silence silence from our non-black, white brothers, non-black brothers and sisters, other can feel deafening
How we can bring our allies into the next two better support, ending systemic violence and racism against the black communities of question, top of mind for a lot of us
Anthony, welcome to the show and thank you so much for being with us
Great
Thank you, thank you Whitney and thank you Chris for inviting me to join this tech community
I think community is really important right now
With so many of us feeling the trepidation, the weiriness, the anger, the fear, the frustration, the terrorism that we've experienced in our communities
This is a time to huddle around a virtual campfire with your policy, with your family, with your loved ones, with your network
It's not a time to be isolated or alone
And I think for allies in this struggle, those of us who don't live this experience every day
It is time for us to lean in
You can't change the channel
You can't tune out
You can't say this is too hard
It is not that hard for us to listen and learn and heed
It is the only way we're gonna build out of this by hearing the voices of Rashad and Phil and Dr
King by hearing the voices of our neighbors and loved ones, by hearing the voices on Twitter, people who we don't know
And so white communities and allied organizations need to pay even closer attention
This is the test of your character, how are you willing to lean in and to engage? For me, I have, um, these, these have been really hard couple weeks
I feel like this is really a test of whether or not we really believe in the American experiment
Do we really believe it? Do we really believe that out of many, one, that a country with no unifying language, no unifying culture, no unifying religion, can we really become one people all equal before the law all bound together with belief in the rule of law
Do we really believe that or do we just think it's a nice saying to see on the back of a paper dollar? And for me this is a referendum on the American experiment on whether we really believe
And the future is in our hands and this is not like other crises
I've been the head of the ACLU for almost 20 years
I feel like I've seen it all
This is different
And this is different because it is cumulative, like Phil and Rashad and Dr
King told us, this is centuries of systemic discrimination
And the bill has come due, and it will continue to be due
And we will pay, unless we really do something quite different
I have been scratching my head at the ACLU For the last week, we've been at this for a hundred years
My organization has been working on this from its inception
In 1931, we were involved with this report about lawlessness and law enforcement
That was our first report that we got behind in 1931
We opened up our first door fronts and after the riots in Watts, so that we could bring legal services and lawyers to the communities so they could demand justice from the police departments
We brought Miranda, you know, the writer of Main Silence
We brought Gideon, the writer of Quarter Point to Attorney if you can't afford one
We fought Bloomberg on stop and frisk and took him years in a lost and front of art litigation to finally apologize
We've been at this for a hundred years
And for the communities that have lived this for 400 years
God
And I've been scratching my head thinking, it ain't working
We don't need another pattern in practice lawsuits
We do another train program on racial bias, or implicit bias in police departments
We don't need to find another lawsuit on qualified immunity
We don't need to kind of bring another racist discrimination or gender discrimination law suit to integrate the police departments
Yeah, we've done that
We will continue to do that
For me, where I've come is that we need to defund the budgets of these police departments
It's the only way we're going to take power back
The more I've read over the last couple of weeks about where this country is, the more I'm clear that that is my North Star at the moment
We will continue to bring the litigation on qualified immunity
We will do the efforts to hold unaccountable law enforcement officials accountable
We will bring patterns and practice lawsuits because the Justice Department is not doing that
So we will continue doing well that good work
But the real thing is we're going to go up to those budgets
When you look at the fact that we spent $100 million on policing, more than incarceration, that the city of Minneapolis spent 30% of their budget on policing
city of Oakland 41% on policing
That when you have New York City police departments and more money in policing that does on housing and preservation development, community youth services, homeless this, we're going after the money
And that's hard core advocacy
Bills drop in local legislature to cut the funding to police, to stop these programs, that give the federal military surplus to police to part
So they become like little mini armies, these are only by police officers
These look like standing armies in the enemy are communities of color
So we need to take away their toys, we need to cut their budgets, we need to shrink the police infrastructure so that we can get police out of the quotidian lives of people of color and communities of color
The ubiquitousness of police enforcement and things that the police do not have a role should not have a role to play
People do not should not lose their lives over whether or not a cigarette pack has a proper tax stamp or whether a $20 bill was forced or not
That's not worthy of spending our dollars on police
Get them out of that business
Let's focus on the most important and the most serious of crimes and that's it
That's it
police are communities
Shrink those budgets
We're going to reinvest those money in local communities
It will be like water on stone campaigns in local legislatures, local city councils, wild report cards for people who talk out of both sides of their mouths and say we believe in police reform and yet they're still going to vote for 30 or 40% for the police
I'm going to put that right to the public
I think we just have to stay at it because I think that's the only way we can go get at this in a different way because much of what we try to do is just simply not working
You know with that I struggle with how do you find the optimism in this moment because you have to find the optimism
You have to find the way there
It's still thing that even though in the face of so many setbacks there's been change
It's been too little to slow not enough
We need to kind of rock it boost it, but you can't lose sight of the optimism
And I've been thinking about who are the folks who inspire me and Dr
King's father, of course
And the words of Rashad and Patrice Colors and others have inspired me
But I found inspiration in the words of a scholar
I really don't like very much
Sam Huntington often criticizes being a conservative or racist
But sometimes you can find inspiration even in your enemy's words
And then there's one of his books, which I pulled off the shelf I have
It's just he writes about how America is a disappointment because it failed to live up to its aspirations
And he actually started talking about it as Americans a failure because it doesn't live up to its ideals
But it's not a failure, it's not a bunch of lies
It's a disappointment
And in the disappointment also is the fact that there's hope, I'm paraphrasing it, but I I think we have to kind of wrap all of that together and think about the disappointment and the hope and the resolve to do better
And we need to listen and lean in
And I thank the Ted community
I thank Dr
Tang
I thank Rashad
I thank Phil
Thank you
Wow
Thank you, Tito
for you
That was astonishing
I guess we're bringing everyone back now to have a conversation among us to ask some questions from our community
I hope you're entering those questions
So I don't know whether we can bring back our guests onto the screen at this point
Welcome back
I guess I'll start, let me start with a question to you Dr
King
I was so inspired by what you said
Your father of course also deeply understood the anger that leads to protest
I think he said that protests are the language of the unheard
And I'm wondering what you would say to someone right now who is angered beyond measure by what's happened and also sees this could be the moment, you know, like that, that there's, someone who believes that the system is so fundamentally broken that our best choice is to tear it down, that that is actually that this may be a once an a generational moment to do that
and so to actually believe that protests, including violent protests, actually is the way right
Now what would you say to someone who thought that? First I just wanted to make just the slight correction you say, riots of the language of the young herd
I apologize
But that is the point even more powerfully
But he is
Protest we must and we must continue to always protest
To keep the issues and the awareness before people
But you know, when a person is angry sometimes it's hard to reach them
I've been on that journey
I was out of stage of my life where I was so angry I wanted to destroy and I'm the of Martin Luther King's here and grew up in a household of love and nonviolence and forgiveness
And I had to go through that journey
I was surrounded by the right kind of influences, fortunately, because that would have been a sad story
But I think it's really allowing ourselves to hear the anger and allowing the space for the anger but also trying to help young people re-channel that energy
And we've got to start ensuring that we connect them to some of the work that has been and now is elevated to another place
Color change the work that you're doing the ACL, you to work that they're doing
Because sometimes there's this connection that intensifies the emotion and makes you feel helpless
But if you can channel that anger, connect it with action that is towards creating the social and economic change, then it begins to build you up
And then you can begin to become more constructive with the angle
It's great
And we have some questions that are coming in from our community, but before we do that, you all sure it's such powerful meaningful statements right now
And many of you touched on the fact that this is not the first time that we're experiencing this, the murder of George Floyd, our barrier, we're not a tailor, but this is one of these are three of many, many instances, just like this
I'd love to hear your all address what has sort of brought us to this boiling point
What has contributed to this moment where we're now experiencing things as Anthony, as you said, the feels so much worse than than other moments
And that's it
Anyone who feels comfortable to take that question
Rashad, I want to hear you
I want to disay somebody to pick it up
I think we've always been at that moment
But this moment is different because of the void and leadership
There's no real moral voice in our country and the person who sits in the office of the presidency is not, you know, leading in the right way
And so it is, and has kind of, you know, not kind of has given license to certain things
And so now it's, you know, he's lit the fires
Yeah
You know, the thing I like, the thing, the thing I like here is that, you know, I think a couple of things
For the last couple of months, we have been both seeing and experiencing all of the ways that this country's decisions of underinvestment of targeting black communities has been killing black people through COVID
And while we've been in our homes, we have also been watching how the media has blamed us as we have been the essential workers in so many places and trying to ensure that This country keeps going
We've watched White men with guns show up to capitals with demanding basically black and brown people go back to work and then we see this eight minute video with the police officer With his knee on someone's neck after seeing that video of a mod Arbery and hearing the story of Brianna Taylor and we see him looking in the camera basically knowing that America was not going to punish him
And what I think is that it's just enough as a enough that people didn't feel that they had a channel for that out region and because people had been inside and because people had been experiencing all the ways in which the structures had also been colluding to kill us that what we're seeing is a alignment of all of those things where people are making demands at a much bigger and and much bolder than before
And we recognize that while we don't have leadership at the federal level, we also have to recognize that a no political party can say that they have been 100, neither political party can say they've been 100% on the right side of all these issues
And so people are mobilizing
They are fighting back and like never before
And in some ways, people are unwilling to accept answers like just go vote, or just participate in the process
Because we recognize that black people have been voting, Black people have been part of voting and part of ensuring that
And so that I think is why this moment feels so much different
Combine with for the last seven years since Trevon, we have seen the growth of a new movement of activists and leaders all around the country who are also in a very different place to be able to move the needle on so much of what's possible
We have a question here from Genesis B
And if you can get that up here
Here in Mississippi the police is synonymous with the clan historically
How do we purge law enforcement of why it's supremacist? So I guess that's partially to me being the psychologist of bias
I'll say that just yesterday we had an officer in Denver who posted on social media himself and two other officers saying let's go start a riot
He was fired that day
I worry about all the officers that the FBI has now for almost half a decade, but warning us, are being law enforcement and unions being infiltrated by white supremacists
All the officers that have social media accounts but they're private
The Visible Institute has put some things forward
We're not talking seriously about the domestic terrorism threat that white supremacy represents
So the first thing we got to do is we got to take it seriously
We have to actually say outlaw and I can't believe that on a day like today, every one on a week like this week, I have to say out loud, white supremacy is alive and well and a driving force of American politics
This shouldn't be controversial
I shouldn't be looking to forward to getting hate mail in my inbox for it, but that's the reality
So the first part of solving a problem is acknowledging it exists
But the second thing is we need to arm municipalities, that's law enforcement, be even more so communities with the ability to take action when someone violates their values
Right now, I think about the case in Philadelphia where Charles Ransie, what he was chief there, was commissioner there, fire six officers, right? Concerns about racial bias and concerns about police brutality and those six officers were back on the same job inside of three months
We now have a law enforcement system that says, you can lose your job in one jurisdiction and get the same job as law enforcement and another jurisdiction
And without the national registry and the capacity for law enforcement to make different decisions, we're going to have this exact problem, not just the Mississippi, but in Minneapolis, and Louisville in New York and LA
So how much of the problem stems from the fact that police unions have a huge amount of power to protect and sometimes reinstate so-called bad Apple offices? Yeah, so I'm getting this question a lot and police unions are one of the most powerful labor forces in the United States and are unique within the labor movement
Right? So as police unions and teachers unions are the two largest and could not be two different sets of groups of folks
When I talk to union leadership, that's the leadership that wants to talk to the Dr
Black and Stein, right? When I talk to union leadership, what they say is no one hates a bad officer, more than a good officer
But the union contracts and the union associations don't look like that true
What they look like is anybody gets in trouble and the union's only jobs to make sure whatever officers in trouble gets to maintain their job
The perverse incentive here is that when people run for union leadership, no one can run saying these people shouldn't be in the union
It's very hard to do that
What you can run on is say this person didn't protect you enough, right? I'll protect you even more
the bigots I'll protect even them
So we have this perverse incentive where union leadership ends up not really representing the values even of the rest of the union members, but they have massive outsize negotiating power
So yes, engaging with an appropriate right sizing of labor protections for folks whose jobs are difficult, but who should not be protected from the basic values of human rights, human dignity, and public safety
It's got to be part of the process
I mean, when unions are negotiating a two-year band on keeping of records so that there's no ability even to trace what's happening in the state of California, historically in terms of police misconduct, that's not in the interest of public safety, public legitimacy, or our democracy
Yeah, but the thing I would add, Chris, is that I think the labor union piece is a critically important one to think through
Because I think like Phil said, they are a key part the puzzle that's going to have to solve for
And it's frustrating when you look at a place like Minneapolis that film was better than I, but Mayor Jacob Fry, the one who's on TV all the time saying, well, many of the right things that you want to like the official to say at times like this
When he banned his police department from attending the warrior training that was being offered, it was the Minneapolis police federation, local union to defy him and sent their police to the training
And so we need to really be clear that we need to have the police forces under civilian control
I know this sounds full of the entry
I feel like I'm talking about a Latin American kind of totalitarian context
But if we need to kind of exert civilian control of our police in a way that we have yet not been able to think through and to keep our that as the labor unions of the police
And there are moments when you can find common grammar, we brought one of our COVID-related lawsuits to deal with the outbreak of the pandemic in a Maryland jail
We worked really hard
I worked the phones with the head of police unions
We got one of the local unions to serve as plaintiff in our lawsuit, because we understood that the incarcerated folks who are being denied access to masks and social distancing and the conditions and lack of testing, a lack of PPE, that the people who are also being harmed are going to be the guards as well
And they were going to be the vectors communicating the disease out into the community
So if you can find ways of kind of bringing that relationship, but make no mistake when you go after their budgets and you start taking away their kind of their munitions and their seed at the budgeting table, oh, are you going to have a battle on your hats? And we have to think about also as we've shaped the budgets for police, how do we, we deploy people in the police departments to other meaningful jobs
Could you just throw them out on the street and say, you're on your own, you're homeless, good luck to you
That's not a way to deal with redemption
So we have to really think about all these pieces in a much more cohesive way
We have another question here from the audience
From Paul Rucker, the end of summer of 1919
I think they actually just lost it
followed by the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Johnson and it really had anti-immigration act of 1924 and also the rise at the KKK
Is there a possibility that white supremacy will get stronger if we don't seize this opportunity? Rashad, I think this might be something that would be great to hear your perspective on working in a so deeply in activism
I'm having another trouble hearing
Oh, I'm so sorry
Can you answer the? Yeah, okay
No, it's okay
Can you read the question on the screen, Roshat? It's it
Oh, I heard that
I heard you
Yeah, yes
Yes
I think it might just be my mic is having some issues here
But, yes, see, is there a possibility that white supremacy will get stronger if we don't seize this opportunity? Yep
Yes
Absolutely
Yes
You know, well, like, like, to be clear, you know, you know, you know, well, like, like, be clear, right? If we don't have the right diagnosis of white supremacy, if we think of white supremacy as just hoods, if we think of white supremacy as just folks who are operating with, you know, in some of these sort of underground networks that have grown if we're just thinking about white supremacy and white nationalism as people who march with Tiki torches and Charlottesville, then we will really mistake all the ways in which our systems and structures have white supremacy and bedding and allow for something like a Tulsa Race Massacre to happen, something like anti-immigration to happen, but on a day-to-day basis, allow for the targeting of black communities through predatory practices by banks, the targeting of black communities through predatory practices like bail
A whole set of systems that can be produced day in and day out
We live in a country where the rules are far too often designed in ways that create a caste system that creates a different standard for some over others
And so when I talked about the inflection point, right, of this moment where something could really go forward or something could turn backwards, we are seeing this right now with this current president and as we look at what could be potential happening with the next election, we have to be very, we have to be very clear that Donald Trump doesn't just operate on his own
He's enabled by big corporations who benefit from him being an office and so continue to turn a blind eye to all the things that he does
They may post black lives matter, but they show up to the White House and engage with Donald Trump
And then we have a whole set of politicians that me, sometimes say that he said something that was wrong, but then allow for, but support his platform in other ways
You know, true co-conspiracy in the effort to dismantle white supremacy and white nationalism is not a thing that people can do on vacation
It is a 365-day project of us constantly working to dismantle all of the structures that have been put in harm's way
The thing I, the final thing I will just add about, because someone mentioned about police unions and I wanna just add that part of the, one of the problems with police unions and many of us have been in this position, I think, is that I have shown up to the table with police unions on many occasions
I remember going to the White House during the last administration and being around a table as we were talking about policing and police reform
And having members of the, of the, fraternal order police leadership, say things like, All of this talk of racial profiling is new to us
It is one thing for folks to not agree with you on the policy reforms necessary
It is another thing for people to say that our demands are too aspirational
It's another thing to be gaslit until the problem doesn't actually exist at all
And that is what we are dealing with
And so we have to actually change the way that people see these institutions, politicians who say that they are on the side of justice and reform can no longer take money from police only unions and for turn or order police
We actually have to create a new standard, a new litmus test of what does it mean to actually be with us? You can't just sing our songs, use our hashtags and mark your own marches if you are on the other end supporting the structures that put us in harm's way, that literally kill us and this is the opportunity for white allies to actually stand up in new ways
to be the type of ally shift and the type of work that truly dismantle structures not just provides charity
I gotta add to that
We're at so Paul, thank you for the question
But we're in a moment where people a lot of people are looking at what's happening on the street as if we can have a go, we weren't in the midst of a global pandemic as the greatest news story that big news story going on
One of the things I'm most worried about and having worried about since the very beginning I've been talking to our chiefs about who we work with, is say, you must be out of the social distancing policing game
You can't be the ones doing that
And the reason is this
Ram moment where creating skate goats and enemies and others is incredibly politically advantageous for at least one side
And there is deliberate efforts to do exactly that
And we've seen that black communities are two and three and four times more likely to contract this virus, which feels like the manifestation of racial discrimination because it is
But very soon, that's gonna look like black people made bad choices and they need to stay away from us
And when that happens, that's when law enforcement gets used to regulate where black movement can be
We used to call it sundown towns
I don't know what we're gonna call it when it's around COVID, but it's coming
I'm already seeing that on communities like next door and on Facebook groups, of people who don't think of themselves as white supremacists, but just what the disease, when the disease has a black and brown face
So we're not only dealing with the moment of generational tension between black communities and law enforcement, we're dealing with a moment when people are looking for scapegoats and black people's vulnerability has always been our greatest casting note for being cast as scapegoats
So for folks who are worried about this, this is not inevitably a moment for change and reform and enlightenment and America's best values because historically, these have been precisely the moment when regression back to white supremacy have ran supreme
So let's not just look at everybody's signaling
I don't wanna just see black and white cops on their knees
I wanna see the policies
I wanna see the things that will prevent this kind of thing from moving to the next stage
Mm
Reset, I want to respect that
I know you've got a hard stop at one
And so I just want to thank you for your participation
If you've got a couple of final words, you want to share that would be great
And then if it's okay for the other three, I just, I think there's just a couple of other questions
I'd love to put and continue this conversation for just a moment longer if possible
Richard, any closing words? The thing, the thing I want to say is that now is the time for action
And I want to invite people in to join us at Color of Change, to make, to make justice real
And in so many ways you can visit us at color of change
You can take action five, 10, 15 years from now
We will be dealing with the impacts and of what we did or didn't do in this moment
How we stood up and how hard we were willing to fight
And as the other speakers have said, now is not the time for a reform around the edges
Now is time for dismantling the policies and practices that have hold us back and championing solutions and new rules that will move us forward
And so we hope that you will do something, whether it's with us, or whether it's with local organizations in your community, or other groups around the country
But this is an opportunity to make change, and I believe that we can make justice real
If we find the passion and the energy to work together to achieve it
So thank you all for having me, and I hope that we have an opportunity to build, not just online, but offline in the months to come
Thank you so much, Rashad
We're just going to ask this last question of you
This one's from David Fenton
How can the movement unite around a clear simple platform of policies to enshrine in legislation like making all complaints against cops, public, banning or choke holes, ensuring independent review boards, et cetera? And that seems like a great place for you to chime in, Dr
King, if you have some thoughts on that
I think that was to go to you, Dr
King
Oh, OK
You know, this might sound simplistic, but it's a Nike thing
I think we have to just do it
We have to see how work is interconnected
there's been efforts towards people working in that vein that we have to intensify that and and doing it
One of the things that my my my father said and I know people sometimes get tired of hearing me say my father said but I just think I wish should I say we had really listened to him because we wouldn't be on this platform right now having this kind of conversation
But he left something with a sort of a blueprint for him where do we go from here chaos of community, his book, and he said going forward, the nettle some tasks is the organized our strength into compelling power
And that is so key because oftentimes we organize merely around passion
But people have certain areas of strength and talent and giftedness
And we've got to figure out how to build our core elections based on these strengths, you know, people do different things well
And so in order to unite in an effective way that they might not elude the demand that we're making, I think that's what's going to happen
People have to do their own personal assessment within their organization
I call it a swadden analysis
And then that swadden analysis has to happen across organizations so that we can make sure that we're moving in a united manner
it manner of the strengths that each organization brings so that we can maximize the impact and the effectiveness to do things like this in terms of getting the legislation in place that is needed in this hour
Thanks so much just to a quick closing words from you Anthony and that's from you Phil Anthony
You know I would just say that what gives me hope are the young folk
You have to believe that among this group, this group of youngins, seeing what they're seeing, living with this president, with these instincts, seeing the continued indifference that mainstream communities have given to issues of racial justice or economic justice
got to believe that what comes out of this kind of very hot fire is something even more powerful and strong than we've ever seen before
And if that's what gets me through the hard days that we're now experiencing, it's thinking there is another doctor king among the young and doctor king
And I have to believe that what they're seeing and what they're witnessing and they're righteous in the nation and their frustration and their anger is going to be miraculously a beautiful blossoming of the new opportunity of a new change
This generation will take us there
I have to believe that my generations failed them miserably
So I'm just looking forward to the new ones
Thank you
Thank you
So thank you, Anthony
So it's really has been a privilege to be on with you all to David's question
Let me say that that a number of civil rights organizations, I believe, the ACLU among them, CBE, a number of self-replicating equity, and hundreds more have signed on to principles for legislation that would include eight pillars
It's been led by the leadership conference for civil and human rights, and includes a federal ban on chokeholds
It includes a national registry for officers who have engaged in misconduct
I also think that it's important at this moment to get, we've got law enforcement, chiefs of major cities willing to say, if we emerge from this moment and our profession hasn't changed, then we have failed again
So it's a critical time to get behind
I would directly to the LCCHRs website, I'm a fan of the eight pillars, because I won't remember them all right now, and to start calling your local law enforcement, and say, yes, own that
You should be signing on
They should be going public with letters that do all of that
But I'll also say this for a path forward in the principles, I'll end where we were as started, which is that this is bigger than policing
These are the unpaid debts owed to black communities for stolen labor, own to out-to-native communities for stolen land, for stolen culture, for years taken away and from lives lost in it
This is bigger than policing
If we don't understand the size of it, then there's no solution that's really truly proportional to the moment
But in this moment when we're seeing trillions of dollars and bailouts mostly for corporations, it is absolutely a time when we can do things that normally people could pretend that's too much
It's too big
We can't
We have literally all the money in the world that can be spent and directed towards making us the society we pretend to be before moments like this happen
So the The thing that gives me hope is that the lies have to be obvious now
The lies have to be that was a reasonable use of force
The lie has to be, we don't have the money
The lie has to be that's too hard
It's too big of a challenge
This stuff feels impossible every day except today because the alternative is we lose everything
Everything is at stake
Our democracy is at stake
The people we choose to be, we claim to be, that's at stake
In the face of that, I think we can do impossible things
I think we can be mighty
So my hope for all of us is first that we wake up tomorrow with more peace in the evening than war, and that we hold on to what's possible from this moment as the same time that we hold on to the size of the task in front of us
I don't want to come out with half measures out of this
I don't want to come out with radicalized youth and indifferent agent, I don't know what the contract, that radicalize use and indifferent people who are always like me
I wanna come out with a unified country that understands that the costs that we owe are big and our pockets are deep enough to match it
Well, thank you to each of you for extraordinary eloquence, really so powerful
And this conversation obviously continues
I know that as many people listening, You'll have other questions
This, I think, from 10 to 20 years, just the start of the conversation
But if the extent that our job is to amplify voices that matter, we can be proud of to be amplifying further your extraordinary voices
So thank you for being part of this today
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you all
Thank you all
I arrived in the US from Kingston, Jamaica in the summer of 68
My family of six crammed into a small, two bedroom apartment in a three-story walk up in Brooklyn
The block had several children, some spoke Spanish, some spoke English
Initially I was not allowed to play with them, because as my parents said, them too run bonkshuss
So I could only watch them from my window
Roller skating was one of their favorite activities
They love hitching a ride at the back of the city bus, letting go of the rear bumper as the bus arrived at the bottom of the block in front of my building
One day, there was a new girl with them
I heard the usual squeals of laughter in this first with Miramira Miramira Spanish for look, look, the group grabbed onto the back of the bus At the top of the block, and as they've rolled down laughing and screaming, Mira Mira, Mira, the bus abruptly stopped
The experienced riders adjusted in quickly let go
But the new girl, Lurch back, and fell onto the pavement, she didn't move
The adults outside ran to help her
The bus driver came out to see what had happened and called for an ambulance
There was blood coming from her head
She didn't open her eyes
We waited for the ambulance and waited
And everyone said, where is the ambulance? Where is the ambulance? The police finally arrived
And all the black America man said, eight no ambulance coming
He said it again, loudly, to the cop
You know eight no ambulance coming
They never said no ambulance here
The cop looked at my neighbors who were getting frustrated, lifted the girl into the patrol car and left
I was 10 years old at the time
I knew this wasn't right
I knew there was something more we could do
The something I could do was become a doctor
I became an intern, a thing committed
My career for caring for those we often call the undeserved, the vulnerable
Like those neighbors I had when I first immigrated to America
During my early training years in Harlem and the 80s, I saw shocking increase in young men with HIV
Then when I moved from Miami, I noticed HIV included women and children, primarily poor black and brown people
Within a few years, an infection seen in a select population became a worldwide epidemic
Again, I got the urge to do something
Fortunately, with the help of activists and advocates and educators and physicians like Nehutri to disease, we found a way forward
There was a massive education effort to reduce HIV transmission and provide legal protection for those with the disease
There was a political will to make sure that as many patients as possible worldwide, regardless of the ability to pay could get access to medication
Within a couple of decades, there were new treatments that transformed this life-threatening infection to a chronic disease, like diabetes
Now there's a vaccine on the horizon
Over the last five to seven years, I've noticed a different epidemic among the patients in Florida
And it looks something like this
Miss Anime, a retired clerical worker living on a fixed income in Opalaka walked in for medication refills
She had common chronic conditions of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and asthma with overlapping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD
Ms
Anime was one of my more adherent patients, so I was surprised she needed refills of her breathing medicines earlier than usual
Towards the end of the visit, she handed me a Florida-powered light-formin asthma to sign it
She was behind on her light bill
This formal load physician's seductive and serious medical conditions required equipment that would be impacted if the patient's electricity was disconnected
But Miss Anna May I said, you know, use an medical device is subreting
I don't think you qualify
Further questioning revealed she had been using her air conditioner day and night because of the heat so she could breathe
Needing to buy more as many hairless left her little money, she couldn't pay all the bills so it piled up
I filled out the form but no one she might be denied
I also sent her to the social worker
Then there was Jorge, such a sweet, kind man, who often gifted our clinic with some of the fruits he sold on the streets of Miami
He had signs of worsening kidney function whenever he worked days on end on those hot streets, due to dehydration, just not enough blood getting to the kidneys
His kidneys worked much better whenever he took some days off
But we'd know other support, what could he do? As he says, Rain or Shine cold or heat, I have to work
But the most damn in case of all, maybe Miss Sandra Fade twigs a fort laud a day with COPD
She was arrested after fighting with her daughter over a fan
On her release from jail, she returned to her apartment, cough non-stop, and died three days later
Here's what else I noticed
The data showed allergy seasons a start in weeks earlier
Nighttime temperatures arising
Trees are growing faster
And mosquitoes, car and dangerous diseases like Zika and Dengue are showing up in areas they didn't exist before
I also see signs of impending climate gentrification
That's when richer people move into poor neighborhoods that are at higher elevation
And less subject to flood damage from climate change
Like in my patient, Madame Marie, who came in stressed and anxious because she was evicted from her apartment in Miami's little Haiti to make room for a luxury apartment complex whose developers understood that little hate would not flood because it's 10 feet above sea level
And undeniable, clear and consistent warming trend is on the way
A health emergency, even bigger than HIV-AIDS, seems to be in the works
And it was my annoying compations that were dropping clues of what is what looked like
This new epidemic is climate change, and it has a variety of health effects
Climate change impacts us in four major ways, directly through heat, extreme weather, and pollution
Through the spread of disease, through disruption of our food and water supply and through disruption of our emotional well-being
In medicine, we've used new monics to aid our memory
And this pneumonic heat wave shows the eight significant health effects of climate change
H
Heat illnesses
E
Exacubation of heart and lung disease
A
asthma worsening
T
Traumatic injuries, especially during extreme weather events
W
Water and Foodborne illnesses
A
Allergies worsening
V, vector-borne diseases spreading, like Zika, Dengang and Lyme, and E, emotional stresses increasing
Poor vulnerable people are already feeling the effects of climate change
They are the proverbial canary in a cold mind
Truly, their experiences are like oracles or prophecies
The guiding light for us to pay attention that we are doing something to our world first that's hurting them first
but in a matter of time, we are next
If we act together, doctors, patients, and other health professionals, we will find solutions
We have done this with the HIV crisis
There was thanks to the activism of patients with HIV that demanded medications and better research and the collaboration of doctors in scientists that we were able to control the epidemic
And then it was thanks to international health agencies, NGOs, politicians, and pharmaceutical companies that HIV medications became available in low-income countries
There is no reason we can't also apply this model of collaboration to address the health effects of climate change before it's too late
Climate change is here
Sorry, they damaging the health and homes of poor people
Like my patient Jorge, most of us will have to work
Whether rain or shine, cold or heat
But together, these patients and their doctors hand in hand with some basic tools can do so much to make this climate transition less brutal for all of us
These patients inspired me to found the clinician's organizations to fight climate change
We focus on understanding the health effects of climate change, learning to advocate for patients with climate-related illnesses, and encouraging real-world solutions
The recent Gallup study show a three of the most respected professions are nurses, doctors, and pharmacists
So, respected members of society, we have amplified voices to influence climate change, policy, and politics
There is so much we can do
As clinicians, our many patient contacts are losing to see things before others
And this puts us an ideal position to be on the front lines of change
We can teach climate-related illnesses in our health professional schools
We can collect data on our patient's climate-related conditions by making sure they're billing codes to identify them
We can do climate-related health research
We can teach how to have green practices and homes
We can advocate for a patient energy needs
We can help them get safer homes
We can help them get necessary equipment in those homes when conditions weresen
We can test the fine front of lawmakers as to the findings
and we can medically treat our patients, climate-related illnesses
Most importantly, we can help prepare our patients mentally and physically for the health challenges they will face using a model of medicine that incorporates economic and social justice
This would mean misandruffy twigs with COPD who died after being released from jail after a fight with her daughter over a fan, would have known that the heat in her apartment made her sick and angry and seek a safer place to go for cooling
Even better, her apartment would never have been so hot
From the poor have learned their lives are not only vulnerable, but are stories of resilience, innovation, and survival
Like that wise old man who loudly spoke truth to the cop that summer night, eight no ambulance coming and compelled him to deliver that little girl to the hospital instead
You know what? Listen up
If there's going to be a medical response that climate change, it is not going to be just waiting for an ambulance
It is going to happen because we, the clinicians, take the first step
We make so much noise that the issue cannot be ignored or misunderstood
It is going to start with the stories our patients tell
and the stories we tell on their behalf
We're going to do what is right for our patients, like we've always done
But also what is right for environment for ourselves and for all the people on this planet, all of them
Thank you
Thank you
Consider this unfortunately familiar scenario
Several months ago, a highly infectious sometimes deadly respiratory virus, infected humans for the first time
It then proliferated faster than public health measures could contain it
Now the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic, meaning that it's spreading worldwide
The death toll is starting to rise and everyone is asking the same question, when will the pandemic end? The WHO will likely declare the pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained and rates of transmission drop significantly throughout the world
But exactly when that happens depends on what global governments choose to do next
They have three main options, race through it, delay and vaccinate, or coordinate and crush
One is widely considered best, and it may not be the one you think
In the first, governments and communities do nothing to halt the spread, and instead allow people to be exposed as quickly as possible
Without time to study the virus, doctors know little about how to save their patients, and hospitals reach peak capacity almost immediately
Somewhere in the range of millions to hundreds of millions of people die, either from the virus or the collapse of healthcare systems
Soon the majority of people have been infected and either perished or survived by building up their immune responses
Around this point, herd immunity kicks in, whether virus can no longer find new hosts, so the pandemic fizzles out a short time after it began
There's another way to create herd immunity without such a high cost of life
Let's reset the clock to the moment the WHO declared the pandemic
This time, governments and communities around the world slow the spread of the virus to give research facilities time to produce a vaccine
They buy this crucial time through tactics that may include widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected and people they've interacted with, and physical distancing
Even with these measures in place, the virus slowly spreads, causing up to hundreds of thousands of deaths
Some cities get the outbreak under control and go back to business as usual, only to have a resurgence and return to physical distancing when in new case passes through
Within the next several years, one or possibly several vaccines become widely and hopefully freely available thanks to a worldwide effort
Once 40-90% of the population has received it, the precise amount varying based on the virus heard immunity kicks in and the pandemic fiddles out
Let's rewind the clock one more time to consider the final strategy
Coordinate and crush
The idea here is to simultaneously starve the virus everywhere, through a combination of quarantine, social distancing, and restricting travel
The critical factor is to synchronize responses
In a typical pandemic, when one country is peaking, another may be getting its first cases
Instead of every leader responding to what's happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world as the giant inter-connected system it is
If coordinated properly, this could end a pandemic in just a few months, with low loss of life
But unless the virus is completely eradicated, which is highly unlikely, there will be risks of it escalating to pandemic levels once again
And factors like animals, carrying and transmitting the virus might undermine our best efforts altogether
So which strategy is best for this deadly infectious respiratory virus? Racing through it is a quick fix, but would be a global catastrophe, and may not work at all if people can be re-infected
Crushing the virus through coordination alone is also enticing for its speed, but only reliable with true and daily impossible global cooperation
That's why vaccination, assisted by as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner
It's the slow, steady, and proven option in the race
Even if the pandemic officially ends before of vaccine is ready, the virus may reappear seasonally, so vaccines will continue to protect people, and although it may take years to create, disruptions to most people's lives won't necessarily last the full duration
Breakthroughs in treatment and prevention of symptoms can make viruses much less dangerous, And therefore acquire less extreme containment measures
Take heart, the pandemic will end
Its legacy will be long lasting, but not all bad
The breakthroughs, social services and systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone
And if we take inspiration from the successes and lessons from the failures, we can keep the next potential pandemic so contained that our children's children won't even know It's name
I grew up in a family where my father managed all the money
But for some reason when I was eight or nine years old, he started showing me things about money
We would sit at the kitchen table and he'd show me all the bank books
Now, that was back in the day before the internet when we used to have little books at least to keep our information in
And he would show me how he saved in these accounts and he paid bills out of these
And every time he would show me something about money, he would end by saying, and don't you tell your mother
Now, to this day, I really don't know why he said that
But what I do know is to that eight-year-old girl sitting at the kitchen table, it meant, don't say a word
Years later when I got my first job, my father said, you'll bring me your check and I'll put it in the bank for you
But because of what he had taught me years before, I said, I'd like my bank book, and to my surprise, he gave it to me
Right then, at 16 years old, I began managing my own money
I went on to college and then to start my new career as a CPA
But now with student loans, getting an apartment, and a new job, I began the roller coaster ride of accumulating debt, paying it off, and accumulating more
Many years later after getting married, I went through an unexpected divorce
And I was left with a house I couldn't afford and bills I couldn't pay
You might be wondering, how does that happen to someone that's educated and skilled at managing people's money? I had reverted back to what I learned growing up, that one person managed all the money
I had handed over my financial power and I had become financially dependent
The mental dependency is when someone is dependent on a person, a job, or situation for money, and they feel trapped
People fall into two categories, dependent with choice, and dependent without a choice
Someone is dependent with choice when they hand over their financial power and their participation
It can happen in personal or business relationships when one person doesn't want to be involved with the money so they hand over their responsibility to a spouse, partner or professional, like an accountant or manager
This was my situation
I spent all day long managing other people's money so I was relieved that my husband was interested and good at managing bars
I was free for the first time since that first job at 16 years old, I didn't have to be responsible for managing my money
But what I failed to realize was what felt like freedom was really dependency
My mistake is that I didn't stay involved or understand what was going on with our money
You may have experienced this yourself or you may have heard stories of celebrities or professional athletes that have relied on family friends and others to manage their money and they are left, broke, bankrupt and betrayed because they made the choice to hand over their financial power
Someone that's dependent without a choice feels trapped because of their financial situation
They can be in a job or career where they're They're unhappy or being harassed but they can't afford to leave
Or someone that's had to move in with family and friends because they've had an illness or gone through divorce or experienced a tragedy and now they're financially dependent on others
And how many of us know someone that has an elderly parent or a relative that can no longer take care of themselves and they're left to rely on others sometimes handing over their homes, their money, and other assets
Another type of dependency with our choice is financial abuse
Financial abuse is a pattern of abusive behavior used to control and intimidate a partner
Victims are interrelationship and the other person has power over them because they don't have access to money, information, or the resources, and support they need to leave
The All-State Foundation has a program called the Purple Purse that helps victims of domestic violence through financial empowerment
They report that 99% in 99 out of 100 domestic violence cases financial abuse helps keep victims trapped in their relationship
The Purple Purse has coined financial abuse the invisible weapon, because physical abuse leaves bruises and scars, but financial abuse doesn't
Financial abuse and financial dependency leave emotional scars that you can't see
They include hopelessness, guilt, shame, depression, lack of confidence, and self-esteem
Financial dependency is also invisible because no one's talking about it
Why? Because no one wants to show their emotional scars
And because we're taught in our homes, our jobs, in our community, not to talk about money
So many people that I talked about this issue, they can relate and they have a story, but they're not telling anyone their story
When I was told the kitchen table, don't you tell, I never told anyone
It's even hard for me right now to break that rule that I learned so long ago
So what can I do? What can you do? What can we all do to disarm this invisible weapon? We can solve three problems
The first problem is lack of awareness because knowing about money and having money aren't always a solution
In my situation, I was educated and experienced in managing money, but that didn't stop me from becoming financially dependent
Why? Because of the beliefs and experiences I had growing up, one person manages all the money
After my divorce, I had to rebuild my life financially and emotionally
So I took every self-development course and I read every self-help book I could find
And that's when I began to understand the dynamics of the family that I live grew up in and how they played a role in me handing over my financial power
When you become aware of your inner bruises and scars, you can begin to break free from financial dependency
The next problem is lack of information about financial literacy
Financial literacy is having the skills and the knowledge to make informed decisions about your money
It includes topics like savings and investing budgeting and debt
In 2018, only 17 states required financial literacy in high school curriculums
This corresponds with recent studies that show that 66% of Americans are financially illiterate
If you are in a financial dependency situation, start by looking and going through your finances, making decisions, participate in making decisions about your money
If you are in a financial abuse situation, get access to your information
Look for financial documents like bank, credit card statements, Social Security information and account handscores
The last problem is lack of giving and getting support
Many people don't know that there are free resources online online and in your local community to help you learn and establish healthy money habits
There are also free resources if you are a victim of financial abuse, like the perval purse
Giving support includes listening to others that are financially dependent without judgment or criticism
It also involves sharing your story because when you share your story, you empower others and you give them the permission to rewrite their own
It's my hope that by sharing my story, more people will learn about financial dependency, we'll share their own stories, and we'll connect with others to shed a light on this hidden issue so that we can all have financial freedom
Thank you
As a child, I had many fears
I was afraid of lightning, insects, loud noises, and costume characters
I also had two very severe foebies of doctors and injections
During my struggles to escape from our family doctor, I would become so physically combative that he actually They slapped me in the face to stun me
I was six
I was all fighter flight back then, and holding me down for a simple vaccine took three or four adults, including my parents
Later, our family moved from New York to Florida, just as I was starting high school, and being the new kid at the Perocule school, not knowing anyone and being worried about fitting in, on the very first day of school, teacher takes role and calls out Ann Marie Albano to which I respond here
She laughs and says, Oh, precious
Stand up
Say, D
O
G
And I respond, dog, the class broke out in laughter along with the teacher
And so it went because she had many more words to humiliate me with
I went home sobbing, distraught, and begging to be sent back to New York, or to some nunnery
I did not want to go back to that school again, no way
My parents listened and told me that they would investigate with the monceigneur back in New York, but that I had to keep going in each day, so I'd have the attendance record to transfer to ninth grade on Staten Island
All of this was before email and cell phones
So over the next several weeks, supposedly there were letters being sent between the arts diocese of Manhattan and Miami and with the Vatican
And each day I'd go into school crying and come home crying to which my mother would give me an update from some cardinal or bishop to keep her going to school while we find her a spot
I naive or what? Well, after a couple of weeks, one day while waiting for the school bus, I met a girl named Debbie, and she introduced me to her friends, and they became my friends, and well, the Pope was off the hook
I began to calm down and settle in
My past three decades of studying anxiety in children stems partly from my own search for for self-understanding and I've learned much
For young people, anxiety is the most common childhood psychiatric condition
These disorders start early by age four, and by adolescents, one in 12 youths are severely impaired in their ability to function at home in school and with peers
These kids are so frightened, worried, literally physically uncomfortable due to their anxiety
It's difficult for them to pay attention in school
Relax and have fun
Make friends and do all the things the kids should be doing
Anxiety can create misery for the child and the parents are front and center in witnessing their child's distress
As I met more and more children with anxiety through my work, I had to go back to Mom and Dad and ask them a couple of questions
Why did you hold me down when I was so frightened of getting injections and forced them on me? And why tell me these tall tales to make me go to school when I was so worried about being embarrassed again? They said, our hearts broke for you each time
But we knew that these were things that you had to do
We had to risk you becoming upset while we waited for you to get used to the situation with time and with more experience
You had to get vaccinated
You had to go to school
Little did my parents know, but they were doing more than an aculating me from the measles
They were also, and notulating me from a lifetime of anxiety disorders
Excessive anxiety in a young child is like a super bug and infectious, even multiplying such that many of the youth that I see come in with more than one anxiety condition occurring at the same time
For example, they'll have specific phobia, plus separation anxiety, plus social anxiety, all together
untreated anxiety in early childhood can lead to depression by adolescence
It can also contribute to substance abuse and to suicidality
My parents were not therapists
They didn't know any psychologist
All they knew is that these situations may have been uncomfortable for me, but they were not harmful
My excessive anxiety would harm me more over the long term if they let me avoid and escape these situations and not learn how to tolerate occasional distress
So in essence, mom and dad were doing their own home-grown version of exposure therapy, which is the central and key component of cognitive behavioral treatment for anxiety
My colleague and I conducted the largest randomized controlled study of the treatments of anxiety in children ages 17
We found that child-focused cognitive behavioral exposure therapy or medication with a selective serotonin re-up taken hibiter are effective for 60% of treated youth
And their combination gets 80% of kids well within three months
This is all good news
And if they stay on the medication or do monthly exposure treatments, as we did in the length of the study, they could stay well for upwards of a year
However, after this treatment study ended, we went back and did a follow-up study of the participants
And we found that many of these kids relapsed over time
And despite the best of evidence-based treatments, we also found that for about 40% of the kids with anxiety, they remained ill throughout the course of the time
We've thought a lot about these results
What were we missing? We've hypothesized that because we were focusing on just child-focused intervention, perhaps There's something important about addressing the parents and involving them in treatment too
Studies from my own lab and from colleagues around the world have shown a consistent trend
Well, meaning parents are often inadvertently drawn into the cycle of anxiety
They give in and they make too many accommodations for their child and they let their children escape challenging situations
I want you to think about it like this
Your child comes into the house to you, crying in tears, their five or six years of age
Nobody at school likes me
These kids are me, no one would play with me
How do you feel seeing your child so upset? What do you do? The natural parenting instinct is to comfort that child, sue them, protect them and fix the situation
calling the teacher to intervene or the other parents to arrange play dates, that may be fine at age five
But what do you do if your child keeps coming home day after day in tears? Do you still fix things for them at age eight? Ten, 14
For children as they are developing, they invariably are going to be encountering challenging situations
Sleepovers, oral reports, a challenging We test that pops up, trying out for a sports team or a spot in a school play, conflicts with peers
All these situations involve risk of not doing well, not getting what they want, risk of maybe making mistakes or being embarrassed
For kids with anxiety who don't take risks and engage, they then don't learn how to manage these types of situations, right? Because skills develop with exposure over time, repeated exposure to everyday situations that kids encounter
Self-suting skills, or the ability to calm oneself down when upset, problem-solving skills, including the ability to resolve conflicts with others, delay of gratification, or the ability to keep your efforts going, despite the fact that you have to wait over time to see what happens
These in many other skills are developing in children who take risks and engage
And self-efficacy takes shape, which simply put is the belief in oneself that you can overcome challenging situations
For kids with anxiety, who escape and avoid these situations and get other people to do them for them, they become more and more anxious with time while less confident in themselves
Contrary to their peers who don't suffer with anxiety, they come to believe that they are incapable of managing these situations
They think that they need someone, someone like their parents, to do things for them
Now, while the natural parenting instinct is to comfort and protect and reassure kids
In 1930, the psychiatrist Alfred Adler had already cautioned parents that we can love a child as much as we wish, but we must not make that child dependent
He advised parents to begin training kids from the very beginning to stand on their own two feet
He also cautioned that if children get the impression that their parents have nothing better to do than be at their beckon call, they would gain a false idea of love
For children with anxiety in this day and age, they are always calling their parents or texting to stress calls at all hours of the day and night
So if children with anxiety don't learn the proper coping mechanisms when young, what happens to them when they grow up, I run groups for parents of young adults with anxiety disorders
These youth are between the ages of 18 and 28
They are mostly living at home dependent on their parents
Many of them may have attended school and college
Some have graduated
Almost all are not working just staying at home and not doing much of anything
They don't have meaning for relationships with others, and they are very, very dependent on their parents to do all sorts of things for them
Their parents still make their doctor's appointments for them
They call the kids old friends and beg them to come visit
They do the kids laundry and cook for them, and they are in great conflict with their young adult, because the anxiety has flourished, but the youth has not
these parents feel enormous guilt, but then resentment, and then more guilt
Okay, how about some good news? If parents and key figures in a child's life can help the child assist them to confront their fears and learn how to problem solve, then it is more likely that the children are going to develop their own internal coping mechanisms for managing their anxiety
We teach parents now to be mindful in the moment and think about their reaction to their child's anxiety
We ask them, look at the situation and ask, what is this situation at hand? How threatening is it to my child? And what do I ultimately want them to learn from it? Now of course, we want parents to listen very carefully, because if a child is being bullied seriously seriously or put in harm's way, we want parents to intervene absolutely
But in typical everyday anxiety-producing situations, parents can be most helpful to their child if they remain calm and matter-affect in warm
If they validate the child's feelings, but then help the child assist them in planning how the child is going to manage the situation
And then this is key to actually have the child deal with the situation themselves
Of course, it is heartbreaking to watch a child suffer as my parents told me years later
When you see your child suffering, but you think you could swoop in and save them from the pain of it, that's everything
Right? That's what we want to do
Whether we are young or old, excessive anxiety leads us to overestimate risk and distress while underestimating our ability to cope
We know that we're pitted exposure to what we fear weakens anxiety while building resources and resilience
My parents were on to something
Today's hyper-enxious youth are not being helped by overly protective parenting
Comeness and confidence are not just emotions
They are coping skills that parents and children can learn
Thank you
A mountain separating two lakes, a room, paced floor to ceiling with bridal satins, the lid of an immense snuff box
These seemingly unrelated images take us on a tour of a sperm whale's head in Herman Melville's Moby Dick
On the surface, the book is a story of a woman On the surface, the book is the story of Captain A
Ham's hunt for revenge against Moby Dick, a white whale who bit off his leg
But though the book features pirates, typhoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you shouldn't expect a conventional seafaring adventure
Instead, it's a multi-layered exploration of not only the intimate details of life aboard a the wailing ship, but also subjects from across human and natural history, by turns playful, and tragic, humorous and urgent
The narrator, guiding us through these explorations, is a common sailor called Ishmeng
Ishmengel starts out telling his own story, as he prepares to escape the damp and drizzling November in his soul by going to sea
But after he befriends Pacific Islander, Kriquake, and joins A
Habs crew aboard the people
Ishmael becomes more of an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional character
While A
Hab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbucks tries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us on his own quest for meaning, throughout the whole universe, not excluding It's suburbs
In his telling, life's biggest questions, loom large, even in the smallest details
Like his narrator, Melville was a restless and curious spirit who gained an unauthorized education, working as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages around the world in his youth
He published Moby Dick in 1851 when the United States wailing industry was at its height
The Nan Tucket, where the P-Quad set sail, was the epicenter of this lucrative and bloody global industry, which decimated the world's whale populations
Unusually for his time, Melville doesn't shy away from the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whales' perspective at one point when he speculates on how terrifying the huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below
The authors first hand familiarity with wailing is evident over and over again in Ishmael's vivid descriptions
In one chapter, the skin of a whale's penis becomes protective clothing for a crewman
Chaptors with titles as unpromising, has, system and buckets, become some of the novels most rewarding, as Ishmael compares bailing out a sperm whale's head to midwifery, which these reflections on Plato, Tangling whale lines, provoke witty reflections on the ever present perils in Tangling all mortals
He draws on diverse branches of knowledge, like zoology, astronomer, nor economics, mythology, and teachings from a range of religious and cultural traditions
The book, experiments with writing style, as much as subject matter
In one monologue, Aha challenges Mooby Dick in Shakespearean style
Towards thee I roll, now all destroying but unconquering whale
To the last I grapple with thee, from Hell's heart, I stab at thee
For hate's sake I spit my last breath of thee
One chapter is written as a place-cript, where members of the P
C
Multiethnic crew chime in individually and in chorus
African and Spanish sailors trade insults, while a Tahitian seaman longs for home
Chinese and Portuguese crew members call for a dance and one young boy, prophesied disaster
In another chapter, Ishmael sings the process of decenting whale oil in epic style as the ship pictures and rolls in the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landstites
A book so wide ranging has something for everyone
Readers have found religious and political allegory, existential inquiry, social setter, economic analysis and representations of American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict
As Ishmael chases meaning and ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces of optimism and uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterised human existence no matter what it is we're chasing
Through MoviDic's many pages, Melville invites his readers to leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt for the ungraspable phantom of life
So I'm a six of 2019
The sun was shining
The sky was blue
Clouds were that puffy white
It was a perfect spring day
I was walking back to my office in my phone rang and it was one of my I said, hey John, how are you? He said, sir, I'm good, but I've got some bad news
He said our executive officer died that weekend
We went back and forth as what do you mean? What are you talking about? I asked him what happened
He said, sir, he killed himself
I walked around my office for a couple hours in a complete fog, trying to understand what had happened, why I had just communicated with him a few months earlier
And I had no idea that this officer was in trouble
And I fault myself as a leader for not having known that
I went on this process of trying to figure out why, what's happening in the veteran community, why are these things going on? I read reports from the Department of Veteran Affairs, Department of Defense
I've read national studies on mental health and the issues associated with it
I'm going to share with you some of the things I found out
Department of Veteran Affairs has taken a lead on veterans suicide and it's actually their number one priority
Based on the reports they have and the numbers that I've calculated between 2001 and 2019 during the time of the global war on terror, my approximation is there's 115,000 veterans who have died by their own hands
I also looked at Department of Defense report that list casualties, this particular report lists the casualties from October of 2001, specifically to November 18th of last year
During that time frame in a global war on terror, there have been 5,440 active duty members killed in action
So by my numbers, 115,000 approximate suicides, 5,440 killed in action
What does that mean to me? We have approximately 21 veterans ending their lives by their own hand for everyone that has killed by an enemy combatant
It's a staggering, staggering number
These national studies that deal with mental health Tell us that if you have any type of genetic mental health issue within your family that can be passed on, or if something has happened to you in your childhood that was traumatic, your ability to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, significantly decreases, they also tell us that if you want to have a full evaluation determine if somebody has PTSD
You need to have a minimum of one hour interview with a mental health expert that's trained to detect what PTSD is to determine if you suffer from it
Now, let me talk about what happens when you enter into military
When you join the armed forces, you're gonna go through a medical exam, you're gonna take a physical fitness test, you're gonna take a drug test, You're going to take a vocational test so they can figure out what you're good at and hopefully place you in that type of job category
But would you believe that with approximately 115,000 suicides over the last 20 years? And the data that we know from the national studies on how to determine if somebody's going to be able to cope with post-mine stress disorder, we still don't have a standardized mental health evaluation for our recruits entering into the service
That's something I think that needs to change
Number two, when you leave the service, when I left the service in 2003, I had to attend some mandatory classes about two days worth of classes and then I was on my way
Today it's a little different
Today you'll actually get a call if you're on what we call terminal leave or pay time off that you're trying to use up before you actually are fully discharged
I talked to one veteran who got a call, he was on his way home from work and the only thing He could think of as how quick can I get off this? And I think the call lasted maybe 10 or 15 minutes
But yet the national studies tell us it needs to be an in person one hour interview
I think that's something that we can improve upon
There's another thing that the Department of Veteran Affairs talked about in the reports
They said that our service members, their self-medicating, tend to be at a significantly higher risk of suicide
So those veterans are self-medicating with alcohol or drug abuse
In fact, the Department of Veterinary Affairs has classified opioid use disorder or OUD as one of the epidemics
So as I talked to Marines for my unit and tried to learn more about it, I started to find out some really, really alarming things
I had a Marine who came back from Iraq and he went to the hospital for a back pain and he was prescribed some opioids
He also suffered from post-max stress disorder
He became addicted to these painkillers because not only did it mask the pain in his back, but it helped him to cope with some of the horrific things that he had to see experience and do over in the Middle East
And he eventually overdosed
other challenge we have is that when you're on active duty, you are under the department of defense
And so all of your doctors, all your healthcare is in that category
When you leave the surface, you are now part of the Department of Veteran Affairs
So these active duty members that seek help for their mental health issues and are diagnosed with PTSD or other mental health issues
When they leave the service, there's no transition to a doctor that's in the Department of Venture Affairs or perhaps out in the civilian world because of privacy acts
Now there's some good news in this
Just recently, it was legislated that a database will be built that will house both the Department of Defense Records, health records, and the Department of Venture Affairs health records
But I want to take that thought a step further
My company was 204 Marines in Sailor Strong
As I looked at, I talked to my Marines for my unit, what we came up with is we are well in excess of a dozen of our members at Committed Suicide
When I talked to senior leaders in the battalion and battalions about six to 700 Marines, they estimate that we're in the hundreds who have committed suicide
So let's take this database that we're building and let's go a little bit further with it
What if when a veteran passes away, whether it's natural causes, overdose or suicide, we're able to feed that into the veteran affairs who is then able to access the department defense records, identify what type of units they were in, what contingencies and operations that they participate in? And let's build the data points to try to figure out are there units that are more susceptible to develop post-magnet stress disorder so that we can get them the mental health prior to going on deployment prior to being in theater, if their in theater get them the mental health while they're in theater and get them mental health counseling and help before they even come home out of theater
And by the way, if we can build a sets of data points, be able to do that, we don't just apply them to the military, we can also use after the general population
If we put our minds together and our resources together and we openly talk about this and try to find solutions for this epidemic that's going on in America, hopefully we can save a life
Those are my thoughts, my ideas
I hope that this talk is not the end of this discussion but rather the beginning of it
And I want to thank you for your time today
Thank you
30 years ago, I walked into a nursing home and my life changed forever
I was there to visit my grandmother Alice
She was a very powerful woman who had lost a battle with a stroke that stole her ability to speak
Just had just three forms of communication left
She had this sound that was like, that she could shift in tone from infatic, no, no, no, to enticing
Yes, you've almost got it
She had an incredibly expressive index finger, which she could shake and point with frustration
And she had these enormous pale blue eyes, but she could open and close for emphasis, saying, why do open seem to say, yes, you've almost got it, and closing slowly was, well, it didn't really need much translation
It turns out that Alice had taught me that everyone has a story
one has a story
The challenge for the listener is how to invite it into being and how to really hear it
Now Alzheimer's and dementia, these are two words that when you say them in front of people, you can watch a cloud to send over them
You can imagine me at dinner parties
What do you do? and I invite people with Alzheimer's and dementia into expression
Where are you going? Fear and stigma wrap themselves so tightly around and experience that affects 47 million people across the world
And they can live with this diagnosis for between 10 and 15 years
And that number 47 million is supposed to triple by 2050
Family and friends can fade away because they don't know how to be in your company
They don't know what to say
And suddenly, when you need other people the most, you can find yourself really painfully alone, unsure of the meaning and the value of your own life
Science is pushing for treatments, dreaming of cures
But loosening that grip of stigma and fear could ease the pain of so many people right now
And luckily, meaningful connection doesn't take a pill
It takes reaching out
It takes listening, and it takes a dose of wonder
That really has become my unending quest, set in motion by Alice, and then later on by really countless elders in nursing homes and day centers, and those struggling to stay at home
And it comes down to the question of how, how do you meaningfully connect? I got a big part of that answer from a long married couple in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where I'm from Fran and Jim, whom I met on a rather dreary winter day and their tiny little kitchen in a humble duplex over by Lake Michigan
And when I walked in, Fran and a caregiver and a care manager really greeted me really warmly
And Jim stood staring straight ahead, silent
She was on a long, slow journey into dementia and was now beyond words
I was there as part of a project team
We were doing what we called artistic house calls with a really simple goal of inviting Jim into creative expression
And hopefully modeling for Fran and the caregivers how they could meaningfully connect using imagination and wonder
Now, this was going to be no small task because it turns out Jim had not spoken in months
Could he even respond if I invited him into expression? I didn't know
Family members, when they try to connect, most commonly will invoke a shared past
We say things like, do you remember that time? But nine times out of ten, the pathway for that one answer to travel and the brain is broken and we're left alone with a loved one in the fog
But there is another way in
I call them beautiful questions
A beautiful question is one that opens a shared path of discovery
With no right or wrong answer, a beautiful question helps us shift away from the expectation of memory into the freedom of imagination, a thousand possible responses for people with cognitive challenges
Now back in the kitchen, I didn't know one thing about Jim
I knew that he liked to walk along Lake Michigan
And when I looked around that kitchen, I saw over by the stove, this trunk that was just covered in little pieces of driftwood
And I thought, I'll try a question that he could answer without words
So I tried Jim, can you show me how water moves? It was silent for a while, but then really slowly he took a step over to that trunk and he picked up a piece of the driftwood and he held it out and then very slowly he began to move his arm leading with that driftwood and his hand it became buoyant in sync with the motion of the waves that he made with his arms
It began this slow journey across calm waters, this gentle rolling to the shore
Transferring his weight from left to right and back again, Jim became the waves
His grace and his strength just took our breath away
For 20 minutes, he animated one piece of driftwood after the other
Suddenly he was not disabled
We were not gathered in this kitchen for a care crisis
Jim was a master puppeteer, an artist, a dancer
Fran later told me that that moment had been a turning point for her, that she learned how to connect with him even as he progressed through the dementia
And it really became a turning point for me too
I learned that this creative open-ended approach could help families shift, expand their understanding of dementia as more than just tragic emptiness and loss into also meaningful connection and hope and love
Because creative expression in any form is generative, It helps make beauty and meaning and value where there might have been absolutely nothing before
If we can infuse that creativity into care, caregivers can invite a partner in the meaning making and in that moment care, which is so often associated with loss, can become generative
but so many settings of care, offer, bingo, and balloon toss
Activities are passive and entertainment oriented
Elders, sit and watch and applaud
Really just distracted until the next meal
loved ones trying to keep their partners at home, sometimes don't have anything to do
And so they resort to watching television alone, which compounds the symptoms of dementia with what researchers now tell us really are the devastating impacts of social isolation and loneliness
But what if meaning making could be accessible to elders and their care partners wherever they lived? I've really been totally transformed and captivated by bringing these creative tools to caregivers and watching that spark of joy and connection, discovering that creative play can remind them of why they do what they do
Bringing this creative care to scale could truly shift the field, But could we do it? Could we infuse it into a whole care organization or an entire care system? The first step toward that goal for me was to assemble a giant team of artists and elders and caregivers in one that care facility in Milwaukee
Together over two years, we tackled reimagining the story of Homer's Odyssey
We explored themes
We wrote poems
Together we created a mile long weaving
We choreographed original dances
We even explored and learned ancient Greek with the help of a classic scholar
Hundreds of creative workshops we embedded into the daily activities calendar and invited the family members to join right along with us and had caregivers and staff from every single area of care collaborating on programming for the first time
The culminating moment was an original professionally produced play that blended the professional performers right alongside the elders and the caregivers
And we invited a paying audience to follow us from scene to scene, one in the nursing home in the assisted living dining room and finally in the chapel for the final scene where a chorus of elders all playing Penelope lovingly welcomed Odysseus and the audience home
Together we had dared to make something beautiful to invite elders some with dementia, some on hospice, into making meaning over time, to learn and grow as artists
All this in a place where people were dying every day
I find In myself now in a place where I'm having to tackle this challenge of meeting a person with dementia across that gap in a more personal way
At a family dinner over the holidays, my mother who has seated next to me turned to me and said, where's Annie? My funny and beautiful and feisty mother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's
And I found myself in that place that everyone dreads
She didn't recognize me
And I had to figure out fast if I could do what I'd been coaching thousands of other people to do to connect across that gap
Do you mean Ellen, I said, because my sister's empty chair was just right across the table from us
She just went to the bathroom
And my mother looked at me and then something deep inside sparked and she reached out and smiled and touched my shoulder and she said, you're right there
And I said yes, I am right here
I know that that moment is going to happen again and again
Not just for me and my mom, but for all 47 million people across the world, and the hundreds millions more who love them
How will we answer this challenge that is going to touch the lives of every family? How are our care systems going to answer that challenge? I hope it is with a beautiful question
One that invites us to find each other and connect
I hope our answer is that we value care and the care can be generative and beautiful
And that care can put us in touch with the deepest parts of our humanity, our yearning to connect and make meaning together all the way to the end
Thank you
I get now to introduce one of the most powerful women in the world
I mean, if we are to escape from the mess that we're in right now, she is going to play a major part in helping us do that
She's the head of the International Monetary Fund, a delight to welcome here, Christina Gaeogheva
Christian, you know, welcome
Thank you, thank you for having me
So you just took on this role late last year and within four months, boom, COVID arrives
That is one heck of an introduction to a new job
How are you doing? Well, I find strength in action
And at the front we have been from day one on this crisis, leaning forward with everything we have to provide lifelines to countries and that means to people and businesses already we have received over 90 requests and we have offered to 56 countries, critical financial packages
I mean, you've described this pandemic as a crisis like no other
In what way a crisis like no other? Well, truly like no other
First, never before, we will inflict on the economy consciously so much pain to fight a virus in safe lives
We are asking businesses not to produce and consumers not to go out and consume
At the front we label this the great lockdown
Second, never before, there would be such a rapid change of fortunes, practically for everybody around the world
In January, I was in Davos talking about anemic growth, growth of 3%, in APU during cowspring meetings, it was already minus 3%
In January, we predicted 160 countries to have positive income per capita growth
Now it is 170 countries with negative income per capita growth
Now this we call the great reversal, very painful
And in 3 uncertainty, we always live with uncertainty, a crazy, but this time it is the uncertainty of a novel coronavirus that policymakers have to integrate
We had to fund combined epidemiological projections without traditional macroeconomic modeling to see true that uncertainty
I must add to this, I very much hope that when we go on the other side in the recovery, we can use a new term and call it the great transformation, make the world a better place
Well, I'll be excited to come onto that in a bit
But in this moment of responding to the crisis, the main tool that seems to have been executed, at least by the rich countries has been this massive economic stimulus to the tune of Trillions of Dollars
Is that a wise response? It is necessity
And you don't hear the front often telling countries, please spend as much as you can
And that is what we do now
We do add to that and keep the receipts
Don't lose accountability to the citizens, to the taxpayers
The reason financial injection is necessary
This fiscal measures of almost $9 trillion are necessary is because when the economy is standing still, unless there is help, unless there is monetary policy stimulus
Firms are going to go massively bankrupt
People would be unemployed
The economy would be scarred when we go to the other side
This scarring is going to make the recovery much more difficult
So that is a wise thing to do and it helps the fact that central banks in major economies have been acting in a synchronized manner and that fiscal stimulus came really, really fast
This is how we see people being able to go through this very, very tough time
But how far can it go? Because it's been described in a sense as printing money, government's reassuring more and more bonds that have to be paid back at some point
There's this term in economics in the minstery moment where things can go very well for a while as everyone believes that the training can keep running, the cycle can keep turning, that governments have all this money
At some point though, doesn't that break down? Do you worry that we may be nearing a minceky moment where like Michael and Mary Poppins scratches, tapens and starts to run on the bank? Is there stress in the international financial system now that concerns you that makes you feel that we may be running out of headroom
Of course, this cannot go on forever
I for one have trust in our scientists
I think we will see breakthroughs and we will see also people and businesses getting accustomed to social distancing, to micro measures that protect from spreading the disease
We have seen very massive injection in health systems, so hospitals can actually treat people that are coming for help
Obviously, if it is to go for a very long time, we would be worried
For now, what we are projecting is that there would be a gradual reopening, we see it already happening in a number of countries
And we project for next year 2021, a partial recovery, not a full recovery unfortunately, but coming to a better place
Now what helps us is something that I don't particularly love, but I see it as a positive a feature very low interest rates in some cases negative
That allows this injection of fiscal measures and liquidity to be sustained over a number of years
And for now, we do not see on the horizon any return to increase interest rates
So, low for longer, and that is in that environment, a helpful feature
I mean, the financial crisis of 2008 kind of came perilously close to breaking the entire financial system arguably it did that by most people's calculation
This is a far worse impact to the economy overall
the world learned something from 2008 that has helped us so far be resilient this time? What the world learned is that the financial system has to be tested and then strengthened to withstand shocks and that is helping us tremendously today
The banking system is resilient and even in the non-banking financial institutions, there is more attention paid to how far can you go without running into trouble
I would say if you look around the world, the most important lesson then was built resilience to shocks
Those who have done it, cope now better
And those who have not done it are in a much tougher spot
And actually for the front, what we are praying is that we will come out of this crisis with this lesson about resilience being spread beyond the banking system
So we actually have this crisis management mindset for a world that is inevitably going to be more shock prone because of climate and also because of the sheer density of economic and social life on our planet
When you're paying a special attention to the situation in developing countries, and it does seem that they're facing a really terrible situation right now, many of them have significant debt denominated in dollars
In the current crisis, the currency is appreciating against the dollar, making it and I'm not impossible for them to execute the kind of injections, stimulus injections that the rich countries are doing and seems to be the only way out
So that seems like a really dangerous cycle is there any way to break that cycle? Well, let me first separate countries that have built strong fundamentals
And now in this crisis, as we are receiving incoming data, There are not very many, but there are still some positive surprises and they come from countries that have built strong buffers, strong fundamentals have been more disciplined during good times
But indeed, we do see quite a number of emerging markets developing countries faced with multiple pressures
They have the hit from the coronavirus
Many of them with weak health systems, then they have the high level of indebtedness from before the crisis, which creates much more difficult environment for them
Then many of them are commodity exporters
Commodity crisis, oil price, went down very dramatically
That hits them again
Many rely on remittances
remittances shrunk some 20 to 30%
And then you have a number of countries that are highly dependent on tourism
Tourism is the hardest hit sector or one of the hardest hits
So, very tough for these countries, but this is why institutions like mine have been wisely created
The IMF, the World Bank, the Regional Development Banks, We work very closely together in this crisis
The IMF fortunately, that was one of the lessons from the 2008-2009 crisis, make sure that in the center of the financial statement is an IMF with financial strength
We have four times more money to lend today than we had then, from 250 billion to $1 trillion And of course we are deploying this funds exactly for the countries that need us the most
And we did one more thing with David Maupas, the president of the World Bank
We called for a debt moratorium for the poorest countries to their official bilateral creditors
And your people tend to say, oh, we don't work together
not good enough, but here is an area where we made this call in late March and in mid-April, the G20 agreed on this moratorium
Amazing
We had the Paris Club China, the Gulf countries, all agreeing that we should not suffocate the poorest countries by asking them to pay that's where their economies are standing at steel
Is it possible that some developing countries are over doing the lockdown policy? I mean, if large numbers of your citizens are already struggling to stay alive, isn't it almost like a death sentence to order them not to leave their homes? Well, Chris, one of the most heartbreaking conversations I would have is with leaders of countries of countries where they have to spare in the face a choice of people dying from the virus or dying from hunger
And it is a very dramatic situation for them
Where you have a very large part of your economy being informal, where people leave hand to mouth every day
The lockdowns we have in the Vasi economies are not quite applicable, but even there, countries are doing really well in social distancing to extend it as possible
Many of the countries in Africa were very early to step up preventive measures
Why? They learn from the Ebola
They learn from prior crisis that hygiene, taking any measure you can really, really, helps
So again, I cannot stress enough how important is solidarity with this countries
How important is for my institution to be there for them in a timely manner and we do it
What do you think? Thank you
This is a wonderful conversation where we're starting to see some questions coming from the community
There's going to turn over here so I can read the first one we have is from Bill Elkis and it's followed up to something were mentioning earlier related to the stimulus on crystalline, what are the prospects for inflation from such large stimulus? At this point, we are not worried about inflation in advanced economies and in majority of emerging market economies
We do worry about inflation in countries that have weak fundamentals, no access to foreign exchange easily, where the only way to address the crisis is our help, or their central banks printing more money
And sometimes it's a combination of those two
Why I don't worry about inflation in advanced economies? because countries that have their hard currency are putting liquidity in place, but at the same time, they're not seeing a big expansion of demand and prices being pushed up
So for this countries, at least for observable future, future, we don't see a way of going like after the Second World War in inflation jumping up
The consumers are not consuming so aggressively
The demand is not that strong
And these are societies where there is a lot of maturity in how they exercise their policy options
But if you are a poor country that out of desperation with no access to markets, no access to hard currency, ought to somehow put money supply enough, then inflation is going to be there
A very extreme case is in Bavue and I do worry there may be other countries
So this is why we are so determined to engage with these countries early and also look at some of the high debt countries, would it be necessary on a country by country basis to restructure debts to prevent that moving in a desperate direction? Thank you
And we have one more question that I wanted to share from our community
This is from Kea Kiyama Shida and it's about how we all can be involved in some of this change
You're tasked with macroeconomic and funding efforts
What should we do as citizens to help renewal and recovery? It is incredibly important for all of us citizens and aside to being the head of the IMF
I am also a gobble citizen that we are to bring that notion of solidarity in a moment of crisis
I loved the way this segment was a musically backed and it was lean on me
It is very important that we do create that sense
We are in this together, we would get together
And please speak up on that
I was for many years, crisis commissioner
And one thing I learned is that majority of people are positive, good people
You can lean on them
And there is a minority that is hateful and fearful and also very loud
So good people speak up, spread that sense of, we are in this together, we'll get through it together
Thank you
And I'll come back later with other questions
Katina, I looked at Stan on that
And just ask you a bit more about leadership, actually
You know, when people think of the nations that have performed best, they often refer to, I'm going to say best, best in response to the current pandemic
They often refer to Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Denmark, and Norway
When they think of those that have performed worse, they often think of Spain, Italy, the UK, Belgium, Sweden, Iran, Brazil, Russia, and the United States
All of that same group are run by men, or but one of the first group are run by women
Is that a coincidence? Well, now speaking a bit subjectively as a woman, I do believe that women are great to lead in a crisis
They are more likely to show empathy to care about the most vulnerable people and to be able to speak about that, they are decisive
I can say that for myself they we take energy from action and we don't tend to kind of morning complain to too much
So there is perhaps something to be said about the value of gender equality for the future
Bring more women for this world of more crisis ahead of us
I mean, it's obviously hard to make generalizations about gender of any kind, but I mean, it's also almost something about the embracing of nuance that women want you better at that than men, men are often it's like, let's win, let's conquer, and in a situation like this, where it's all probabilities, it's like there's so many complex dials to turn on this, this dangerous pandemic machine that we're trying to wrestle
I mean, you know what I mean? I mean, you know what I mean? I mean, you know what I mean? I mean, you know what I mean? I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, everybody and we need this mixture of experience, knowledge and predisposition, man and women coming together
I find it that it is great to have different perspectives when we make decisions
Then the chances of making good decisions are higher
So we need each other, But we also need to recognize these
That yes, there are certain things I have seen it time and again, women are more willing to find the pathway to compromise
They're more willing to be corrected if they're wrong
They say, oh, okay, that's a good point
Let me integrate it in the way I think about it
And so when you are in uncertainty, that is a huge advantage in the season making
So perhaps talk a bit more about your own leadership in this moment
I mentioned you've only recently come to this job
Before that, you were European commissioner, you dealt with humanitarian crises in more than one part of the world
And in your own country, Bulgaria, you witnessed the wholesale transformation of the country, both politically and economically
What lessons can you bring from your past experience to this moment? Well, there are many things I learned
I was very fortunate to have this multiple experiences for the job I have now
But let me highlight a tree
First, how critically important it is to prepare for a crisis
kind of think of the unthinkable and then act with some foresight when a shock hit you
You have a title for this series called Build Back Better
I actually would like to modify it if I may and I would talk about build better before
awareness prevention pay off big time
The second and not necessarily in priority, it is as important is collective action
Working together, seeking help offering help makes a huge difference in emergency
And the third is something I learned time and again
We don't know our internal strength until we are hit
We are so resilient, we are so able to withstand shocks, especially when we come together
That this always gives me this sense of optimism that as hard as it is, we can overcome it
from the days when my country collapsed, the economic collapse, I would get up at 4 o'clock in the morning, queue to buy milk for my daughter
To the days when I would see Syrian refugees, interv allen situations helping each other
To today when I'm the head of the IMF, that internal strength, our power of resilience
the more we add together, the more it is amplified
Actually, could you talk a bit more about the role of the IMF, especially as we look forward to trying to recover from this? What specifically can your organization do to take us forward? So there are three things that are quite unique for the IMF, and they're really so important in a time of crisis
The first one is to give a good diagnostic of what is happening and what is the way forward
Let me just say in this crisis in the very first week, we put together we call it policy action tracker for 190 tree countries
What actions are countries taking? How they can learn from each other? So we can be more effective together
together, we are adding to it now actions for responsible reopening of the economies exactly with that purpose
What we are known best for, we are the financial first responder
We are coming in this incredible shock with very significant financial firepower
And what people don't know is that the front has multiple instruments
Emergency financing is the one we doubled for this crisis
And it is not conditionalities
We are asking one thing, Chris
Pay your doctors and your nurses, your hospitals
Protect your most vulnerable people and parts of the economy
That's it
This is the condition
And the third thing we do at the front is to help countries have the capacity for good policies
After the financial crisis, we help many countries to have good fiscal management, transparency and accountability to improve the performance of public finance
So the fund is not a very big organization by any standard
We are some 3,000 people highly professional in incredibly committed
When you use the expression all hands on deck, that's us
And it is a digital deck
It is a digital deck, this means
I mean, this is a global crisis
A lot of people are worried that unlike perhaps even in 2008, whether it really did seem there was a lot of global cooperation, there's actually in some worrying ways less this time
Are you worried about how crucial is that to getting us through this? I mean, my preoccupation is in our mandate, in my area of responsibility, bring the membership together
We have almost the whole world, a hundred and eighty nine countries around members
And so far, I am very impressed by how responsive the membership has been
I put in front of them in the spring, a package, very strong package of measures to expand the role of the IMF in the crisis
Everything that we ask for, we ask for doubling emergency financing, we got it
very interesting, we ask for tripling concessional financing, exactly because it all like the virus hits people with weak system, the hardest, the crisis hits weak economies, the hardest
So we wanted to triple concessional financing within one month, we got it
We ask for grants for that relief, we got it
So what I'm trying to say here is that we need to focus on ways in which we bring the world together and then act on that
But I understand that rather than complaining that maybe not everything is the way it should be, do your duty to the global community? Well indeed, and the IMF is dependent on the financing from its members, its key members
I mean, you spoke of the trillion dollars that you are looking to make available to nations that need it
As I read it, that comes from, you've got this, this, these units called special drawing rights
You basically draw currency from members
hasn't been pushed back though from the US to block that effort of raising all that money
So the $1 trillion is from our quarters and also from our ability to move money from well to do members from the Advasi economies and landed at very low or zero interest to the developing emerging markets
And we had this one trillion in what was very interesting not everybody noticed that US in the $2 trillion stimulus package included the support for the IMF
The special drawing rights is something that we indeed don't have yet consensus among the membership to do
It was done during the 2009 crisis issuing liquidity and it goes to everybody and there are many voices including mine
I spoke to the G-12 about that that are saying well that maybe a good thing to do now, it is not being supported for reasons, it is not just capriciously
The problem with special drawing rises that when we issue them, they go to all members and the Advasi economies get 62% of the new allocation
And there are some that are saying, can we think of something that is more directed or exclusively directed to dosco who needed
But Chris, everything is on the table for us, as the crisis unfolds, we do, we need to do more
We bring the membership to do more
Winnie
And so we actually have a question from the community that sort of builds on what you're discussing right now
You have Nitha Khan asks, which countries will prove to be resilient in the great transformation? Those with popular leaders, to those with sound financial systems
They both matter
Countries with strong fundamentals are clearly going through this crisis with less trauma that those that had weak fundamentals to begin with
And of course leadership matters how you mobilize a country for action matters
In my view what we would see on the other side, the winners would be those who think today of this crisis also as an opportunity
Clearly digital transformation is a huge opportunity
Moving to e-learning, e-government, e-payments, e-commerce, The first linking small and medium size enterprises through digital to consumers, big winner
Secondly, I very much hope that we would come on the other side with low carbon footprint and a more climate resilient economy
who moving this direction, they would reduce the risk for themselves and the world from this other crisis that we are not talking so much about this day, but it hasn't gone anywhere
And you know, if you don't like pandemic, you are not going to like the climate crisis at all
And also countries that are thinking of how to make the economy in the future a fair economy
In other words, we have been seeing inequality building up before this crisis
My colleagues who have researched pandemics have a very bitter lesson for us after pandemics after one after SARS after Zika in a quality go-sup
Well, are we going to let inequality to go up after this crisis? And if we do, we are damaging the fabric of our societies, and my sense is that hundreds of millions of people in this crisis would much prefer to have simpler, fairer, more equitable world to live in, and definitely more sustainable world
And just one more question from our community before turning it back to Christopher for some final questions here
But, you know, as you, this one is from Sarah Rukheimer
And the question is, what do you see as the main potential positive shifts and changes in this world from this pandemic, say, two to ten years from now? I touched upon it a little bit
First, I hope to see fiscal policy to help us recover, to be geared towards green recovery and more equitable recovery
And that is something that is in the hands of policymakers
because it can be done
Secondly, I very much hope to see us integrating what we have learned from the crisis in terms of virtual work, my organization, the IMF
Well, we can shrink our carbon footprint dramatically, just by sustaining the practices we are developing now, And we will
I certainly hope to see in the future much more attention to two things that we saw in this crisis are essential
Universal access to health in some form, strong health systems, as well as strong social safety nets
Built as automatic stabilizers in a time of shock
And by the way, it is cheaper if we do it in this way, the bill for everyone is going to be smaller
And also, I very much hope that this notion of investing in people, recognizing that now that we see this horrible tragedy, the loss of lives, that investing in people is the very best investment We can make
It's great
So, see you again in a minute, Whitney
Catalina, it's so inspiring actually, hearing the energy and stuff, the energy that you bring into this
I don't think many people coming into this would have expected to hear from the head of the IMF this emphasis on, you know, let's solve the crank crisis, let's tackle inequality and injustice
It's, um, do you really believe that this moment, this crisis could help lead us into a great transformation? When people will feel it's your job to sound positive, you have to do that
Do you really see the path forward that we can get through this and how, what sort of time scale are we talking about here, Christina? Well, you don't want one thing I learned from the transition I live through, the transition from center planning to markets is it is tough, it is long, it is painful, and it is a road that takes turns
So I don't have an expectation of miracle from here to there
But I genuinely believe that we are now in a point of our history when people demand from their leaders, safety and security and a society that is not torn apart by conflicts
And that is actually not unusual to see
So I would turn the table a little bit on your crease
After the after a war, we see the world coming together and building a better world
Why not after a pandemic? And yes, we can make mistakes and not take the right route to travel
But we certainly have an obligation to try to get on that road
So if everybody matters, everybody matters, everybody matters for that
So if you could inject one idea into the mind of everybody, on into the world leaders who listen to you, what would that idea be at this moment? optimism, built a better world, possible, desirable, we must do it
That sounds like optimism is the stance, not just a knife belief that it will happen, but a determination to make it that's what you're calling for to use that as the motivation to pull us all forward together
Chris, do I have one minute or I'm done? I need to go
Wait, if you want to say one last thing or one minute? All right, go
I want to say one thing
To recommend to the audience to watch the movie, bridges of spice
There is a part in the movie in which the two main actors, the lawyer and the Russian spy, talk to each other, lawyer says things are very bad
It looks like you may hang
The spy's very calm, lawyer says, I don't you worry
The spy's answer would it help? So my message is, it is tough
But worries won't help
Positive action will
Positive state positive
So that's my message
Well, I have to say thank you
You know, it's incredibly inspiring actually to see your energy and your determined optimism
Let's, let's call it that
I think we wish you the very best as you use your position to help get us out of this mess
Thank you so much, Christina for spending time here at TED
Thank you
A new virus emerges and spreads like wildfire
In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data about who's been infected
Two main viral testing techniques are critical
One tells you if you have the virus and the other shows if you've already had it
So how exactly do these tests work? PCR or polymerase chain reaction testing targets the viruses genetic material in the body and is used to diagnose someone who is currently infected
Yet this genetic material may be present in such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult
This is where PCR comes in
It's widely used to amplify genetic information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed
To develop a PCR test for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequenced its genetic material or genome and identify regions that are unique to that specific virus
PCR then targets these particular segments
A PCR test begins by collecting a sample
This can be blood for hepatitis viruses, feces for polio virus, and samples from the nose or throat for coronaviruses
The sample is taken to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test for the presence of the virus's genome
Genetic information can be encoded via DNA or RNA
HPV, for example, uses DNA, while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA
Before running the PCR, the viral RNA, if present, must be reversed transcribed to make a strand of complementary DNA
Researchers then run the PCR
If the virus is present in the sample, it's unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary primers and copied by enzymes
One strand of DNA becomes hundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked with fluorescent dye
If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive for the virus, meaning the individual is infected
amino acids on the other hand, tap into the immune system's memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously been infected
They work by targeting virus-specific antibodies generated by the immune system during infection
These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign substances like viruses
Amino acids made detect IGG antibodies, the most abundant class, and IGM antibodies
The type that's first produced in response to a new infection
The presence of IgM antibodies suggests a recent infection, but since it can take the body over a week to produce a detectable amount, they're unreliable in diagnosing current infections
Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate for an extended period after infection
Their presence usually indicates that someone was exposed and recovered
Before the amino assay, health professionals draw blood from an individual
This sample then comes into contact with the portion of the virus of interest
If the body has, in fact, been exposed to the virus in the past, the body's virus specific antibodies will bind to it during the test
This reaction produces a change in colour, indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been exposed to the virus
Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively diagnosing people who were infected but went untested
And as exciting potential for those who have developed immunity to a virus, in some cases, their blood plasma could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it
PCR and immunosays are always in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient
For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use of self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour
to Tupisia, which quantifies individual pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further boosting accuracy
And although amino assays are difficult to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able to create one for SARS-CoV-2, even before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic
These tests, along with the scientists who developed them and the health professionals who administer them, are absolutely essential
And when deployed early, they can save millions of lives
Raise your hand and be honest, if you've used the phrase crazy, busy, to describe your day, your week, your month, I'm an emergency room doctor, and crazy, busy is a phrase you will never hear me use
And after today, I hope you'll stop using it too
Here's why you cannot afford to use crazy to describe your busy
Because when we are in what I refer to as crazy busy mode, we are simply less capable of handling the busy
Here's what happens
Your stress hormones rise and stay there
Your executive function in the prefrontal cortex declines
That means you're memory, your judgment, your impulse control deteriorate, and the brain areas for anger and anxiety are activated
Do you feel that? Here's the thing
You can be as busy as an emergency department without feeling like you're crazy, busy
How? By using the same tactics that we use, Our brains all process stress in similar fundamental ways, but how we react to it has been shown by research to be modifiable whether it's emergencies or just daily day in day out stress
Now contrast, crazy busy mode with how I think it was in the ER
Ready mode
Ready mode means whatever comes in through those doors, whether it's a multiple car, pile up, or a patient having chest pain while stuck in an elevator or another patient with an item stuck where it shouldn't be when you know you're dying to ask
Even on those days when you would swear you were being poked, we're not afraid of it
Because we know that whatever comes in through those ER double doors that we can handle it, that we're ready
That's ready mode
We've trained for it, and you can too
Here's how
Step one to go from crazy mode to ready mode is to relentlessly triage
In crazy mode, you're always busy, always stressed, because you're reacting to every challenge with the same response
Contrast that with ready mode, where we triage, which means we prioritize by degree of urgency
This isn't just a nice way to get your to-do list done
Work by Dr
Robert Sapolsky shows that individuals who cannot differentiate threat from non-threat and react to everything with the same response have double the level of stress hormones, which is why this is the first skill to learn
You can't take care of them all at once, but you don't have to, because we triage
read immediately life threatening
Yellow, serious, but not immediately life threatening
Green, minor
And we focus our efforts first on the reds
Now, here this, part of the problem in crazy mode, is that you are reacting to everything as if it is read
So start by triaging correctly
Know your reds
there what is most important and where you can most move the needle
Now it's easy to be confused by noise, but what is noiseiest is not always what is most read
In fact, my severe asnatic patient is most at risk when he's quiet
But my patient over here demanding that I bring her flavored coffee creamer, she's noisy, but she's not read
I'll give you an example from my own life
Last spring, my house flooded, My one year old was in the ER
I was supposed to do a fundraiser for my four year old school and the final chapter of my book was Beyond Late
Maybe not ironically, that was the chapter on stress
My red tasks were getting my one year old better and finishing my book
That was it
Remember, relentlessly triage
The house flood repair? Well, once we had stopped and stabilized the damage, it was no longer a red
It felt red, but it was in fact just noise
No, really, it was quite noisy
This picture on the far right is me wearing earplugs to focus on my book, all the floor is being mechanically dried around me
No, your reds, and do not let your nonreds distract you from them
By the way, it is liberating with a green task to every once in a while be able to remind yourself, that's a green task
No one's gonna die
It's okay if it's not perfect
Now there's one last triage level that we use in the worst scenarios
And that is black
Those patients for whom there's nothing we can do what we must move on
And although it is gut-wrenching, I mention it because you each have your own equivalent, black tasks in your life
These are items that you must take off your list
And I think many of you know what I'm talking about
For me, this was the fundraiser
I had to step down
Because as we in the ER know, if you try to do everything, you have no hope of saving your reds
Step two, to go from crazy mode to ready mode is to expect and design for crazy
Half of handling crazy is how you prepare for it
So step one, we triage step two, we designed to make those tasks easier to do
Science shows us that the more options we have, than the longer each decision takes
And the more decisions we have to make, the more exhaust in our brain gets, and the less it is capable of making good decisions
Which is why this step two, is about finding ways to reduce your daily decisions
Here are four easy examples you can use in your daily lifestyle
Plan, plan your entire week's meals on the weekend so that when it's Wednesday at 6 p
m
and everyone's hangry and requesting pizza, you have no decisions to make to get a healthy meal on the table
Automate, never leave anything to remember that you could automate, whether it's scheduling it as recurring or saved list or recurrent purchases
Colocate when it comes to exercise, store all the equipment that you need for a certain activity together, charged, and ready
So you don't spend energy looking for it
And decrease temptations for anyone driven by sugar cravings
Anyone? Say, I go ahead
That itself is its own form of crazy mode and self-medication for crazy mode
But stop working your willpower, design differently
If a food is out of immediate reach, such that you have to use a stool to reach it, even when it's chocolate, study participants eight, 70% less without thinking about it
I know, let that sit for a second
Designed to make the choices you wish to make easier, Which brings us to the third step to go from crazy mode to ready mode and that is to get out of your head
Come with me
Different story
I'm working in a small satellite ER
When a woman comes in in labor, I realize that the cord is wrapped, not once, but twice around the baby's neck
And I'm the only doctor
doctor
I was scared, but I couldn't let it derail me
Because you see we all get nervous, we all get scared, but it's what you do next that matters
That first feeling isn't the problem
It can be an important sign
The problem comes when we let it derail us when that internal monologue starts and we catastrophize and we start to get that tunnel vision
That's how you think when you're in crazy mode and you cannot solve anything that way
Now I promised to come back to the story, but first, how do I get out of my own head? There are many tactics that you may hear, but for me, I find it best in the moment to actively put my focus on someone else
To deliberately make myself see the person in front of me, see myself in the arena with them, what do they need, what do they fear, and how can I help?" This may sound like a whole lot of warm and fuzzy to you, but it's not
In fact, research shows that when you prime your brain with what is essentially compassion, we disrupt that tunnel vision and internal monologue, you widen your perception so your brain can actually take in broader information so you see more possibilities and can make better decisions
Try it
Know that your internal monologue can derail you
And realize that when you get out of your own head, you get out of your own way
Now what happened to that baby? I focus not on my fear, but on the mother and the baby and what they needed me to do
got the cord off of the baby's neck
And a healthy screaming kicking baby arrived just as a dad ran in from the parking lot
Hi, you have a son, I'm Dr
Daria
Congratulations, you wanna cut the cord? And for a moment, the strong cries of a newborn drowned out the beeps and the sirens that are the normal sounds of the ER
But there was also something else
because when I walked back out of that mother's room, I saw several of my other patients hovering nearby
I suddenly realized that despite their own problems that had brought them to the emergency room, they had all come together to root for this baby, and they now together shared in the joy
Because that is what happens when you go from crazy mode to ready mode
Others notice they want it to
they just don't know how they just need one example, which could be you
Own the busy, but stop calling it crazy
You've always had that ability, but now you're ready
Thank you
When I was a kid, my mom and I made this deal
I was allowed to take three mental health rest days every semester as long as I continued to do well in school
This was because I started my mental health journey when I was only six years old
I was always what my grade school teachers would call a warrior, Later on we found out that I have trauma-induced anxiety and clinical depression
This made growing up pretty hard
I was worried about a lot of things that other kids weren't, and school got really overwhelming sometimes
This resulted in a lot of breakdowns, panic attacks
Sometimes I was super productive and other days I couldn't get anything done
This was all happening during a time when mental health wasn't being talked about as much as it is now, especially youth mental health
Some semesters I used all of those rest days to the fullest
Others, I didn't need any at all
But the fact that they were always an option is what kept me a happy, healthy, and successful student
Now I'm using those scales that I learned as a kid to help other students with mental health challenges
I'm here today to offer you some insight into the world of teenage mental health
What's going on? How did we get here and what can we do? But first, you need to understand that well not everyone has a diagnosis mental illness like I do, absolutely everyone
All of you have mental health
All of us have a brain that needs to be cared for in similar ways that we care for our physical wellbeing
Our head and our body are connected by much more than just our neck after all
Mental illness even manifests itself in some physical ways, such as nausea, headaches, fatigue and shortness of breath
Since mental health affects all of us, shouldn't we be coming up with solutions that are accessible to all of us? That brings me to my second part of my story
When I was in high school, I had gotten pretty good at managing my own mental health
I was a successful student and I was president of the Organ Association of Student Councils
But there's a round this time that I began to realize mental health was a much bigger problem than just for me personally
Unfortunately, my hometown was touched by multiple suicides during my first year in high school
I saw those tragedies shake our entire community
And as the President of a statewide group, I began hearing more and more stories from students where this had also happened in their town
So in 2018 at our annual summer camp, we held a forum with about 100 high school students to discuss teenage mental health
What could we do? We approached this conversation with an enormous amount of empathy and honesty and the results were astounding
What struck me the most was that every single one of my peers had a story about a mental health crisis in their school, no matter if they were from a tiny town in Eastern Oregon or the very heart of Portland
This was happening everywhere
We even did some research, and we found out that suicide is the second leading cause of death for youth ages 10 to 24 in Oregon
The second leading cause
We knew we had to do something
So over the next few months, we made a committee called the Students for a Healthy Organ
And we set out to end the stigma against mental health
We also wanted to prioritize mental health and schools
With the help of some lobbyists and a few mental health professionals, we put forth House Bill 219 on
This bill allows students to take mental health days off from school the same way you would a physical health day
Because oftentimes that day off is the difference between feeling a whole lot better and a whole lot worse
Kind of like those days, my mom gave me when I was younger
So over the next few months, we lobbied and researched and campaigned for our bill and in June of 2019 it was finally signed into law
This was a groundbreaking moment for Oregon students
Here's an example of how this is playing out now
Let's say a student is having a really hard month
They're overwhelmed, overworked, they're falling behind in school and they know they need help
Maybe they've never talked about mental health with their parents before, but now they have a law on their side to help initiate that conversation
The parents still needs to be the one to call the school and excuse the absence, so it's not like it's a free pass for the kids, but most importantly, now the school has that absence recorded as a mental health day, so they can keep track of just how many students take how many mental health days
If a student takes too many, they'll be referred to the school counselor for a check-in
This is important because we can catch students who are struggling before it's too late
One of the main things we heard at that forum in 2018 is that oftentimes, stepping forward and getting help is the hardest step
We're hoping that this law can help with that
This not only will start teaching kids young how to take care of themselves and practice self-care and stress management, but it could also literally save lives
Now students from multiple other states are also trying to pass these laws
I'm currently working with students in both California and Colorado to do the same because as we believe that students everywhere deserve a chance to feel better
Aside from all the practical reasons and technicalities, House Bill 2191 is really special because of the core concept behind it
That physical and mental health are equal and should be treated as such
In fact, they're connected
Take healthcare, for example
Think about CPR
If you were put in a situation where you had to administer CPR, would you know at least a little bit of what to do? Think to yourself
Most likely yes, because CPR trainings are offered in most schools, workplaces, and even online
We even have songs that go with it
But how about mental health care? I know I was trained in CPR in my seventh grade health class
What if I was trained in seventh grade how to manage my mental health or how to respond to a mental health crisis? I'd love to see a world where each of us has a toolkit of skills to help a friend, co-worker, family member, or even a stranger going through a mental health crisis
And these resources should be especially available in schools because that's where students are struggling the most
The other concept that I sincerely hope you take with you today is that it is always okay to not be okay and it is always okay to take a break
It doesn't have to be a whole day, sometimes that's not realistic, but it can be a few moments here and there to check in with yourself
Think of life like a race, like a long distance race
If you sprint in the very beginning you're going to get burnt out
You may even hurt yourself from pushing too hard, but if you pace yourself, if you take it slow sometimes intentionally and you push yourself other times, you are sure to be way more successful
So please, look after each other
Look after the kids and teens in your life, especially the ones that look like they have it all together
Mental health challenges are not going away, but as a society, we can learn how to manage them by looking after one another
and look after yourself too
As my mom would say, once in a while, take a break
Thank you
Thank you

The first pillar is the first one
The first pillar is the first one
The first pillar is the first one
The first pillar is the first one
The first pillar is the first one
The first pillar is the first one
The first pillar is detect
Christian I've been studying infectious diseases together around the world for two decades
We've been using genome sequencing, reading out the complete genetic information of a microbe
It allows us to identify viruses even those we've never seen before
Track them as they spread and watch for new mutations
And now with a powerful gene editing technology CRISPR, We can use this genetic information to rapidly design exclusively sensitive diagnostic tests for any microbe
One of these tools is called shell-up
It can be used to test non-verices on simple paper strips
It is very inexpensive and frontline headquarters can use shell-up
To detect the most common or most threatening viruses within an hour
The other tool is Carmen
It requires a lab, but it can test for hundreds of viruses simultaneously
So hospital lab staff can test patient samples for broad range of viruses within a day
Our second pillar is Connect
Connect everyone and share this information across the public health community
Most outbreaks, hospital staff share case information through paper, Excel, if at all
This makes tracking an outbreak through space and time and coordinating response extremely difficult
So we're developing a cloud-based system and mobile applications that connect community health workers, clinicians, public health teams, everyone, and allows them to upload data, perform analysis, share insights, and coordinate a response and action plan in real time
The third pillar is Empower
Our breath of the latest system can only succeed if we empower frontline workers that are already out there taking care of communities
It requires a lot of training
But it's a nightmare very much aware of that
We spend the past 10 years training hundreds of young African scientists and clinicians
Over the next five years, we will train an additional 1,000-were workers to use centennial detection tools and empowered them to train their colleagues
This way, we will improve the regional hacker system and integrate surveillance into medical practice
So here we are
It's, we're recording this
It's April 7th, 2020
And obviously, we are in the throes of this crazy global pandemic caused by this new coronavirus
So you two have been working together forever and you really came together pretty aggressively with the Ebola crisis back in 2014
What does it feel like from your perspective? Pretty much six years after the Ebola outbreak we're really facing another crisis and we're still pretty much like we never learned from the previous crisis
And that's really for me, it's a heartbreaking
I think that this pandemic has shown us how unprepared that we are everywhere in the world
Christian and our partners together had diagnostics at our hospital sites in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Senegal in early February
Most states in the United States didn't have it for far later
It's very, it tells us that we are all in this together and we are all very much behind the curve
So this Sentinel system is amazing, but I know that the question that's on and everybody's mind is how is that playing into the here and now? You know, we describe centenals of pandemic preemption system and here we are in a pandemic
But what's great is actually the same tools you need to preempt a pandemic are the ones that you need to respond to one
And so all of the technologies that we have laid out, the point of care testing, the multiplex testing, the discovery and tracking of the virus that's changing and the overlay of the mobile applications to dashboard are all critical
For us, it is a war
We basically committed for 24 hours turn around time that took to give results
And that requires us to work around the plot and not stop
So it's a pretty challenging moment
We're away from family
At least I have a privilege to see family today
And then I'm sure, you know, tomorrow I'm heading back in the trenches
In my lab, we took the first COVID-19 genome on the African continent
And then that really was done within 48 hours
And this is revolutionary, you know, coming from an Africa and then making this information available for the global health community to see what virus within Africa looks like
I believe that with technologies and knowledge and then sharing information, we can do better and then we can overcome
The whole idea of Sentinel is that we all stand guard over each other
We all watch each one of us is a Sentinel
Each one of us being able to monitor what is making us sick can share that with the rest of our community
And I think that is what I profoundly want is for us to all stand guard and watch over each other
Huang, it's so good to see you
Thank you for joining us
How's it 2020 been? My 2020 started totally normal
In January, I went to Paris
I did my interview for the fashion week there
I came back to Beijing on January 22nd
Finding things a little bit tense because there were a lot of rumors having lived through SARS
I wasn't that concerned
And on the 23rd, I had a friend of mine from New York come to my house who had a flu, and we had dinner together, and another friend who came who left the next day for Australia for vacation on an airplane
So we were not taking this terribly seriously until There was a lockdown and we've seen that echo around the world
I think still some people find it hard to understand the magnitude of some of the measures that China took
I mean, what else are we missing about China's response in all of this? You know, historically we're just such a two very different countries in terms of culture and history
I mean, these are two completely different human experiences for its people
So for China, when the lockdown high happens, people are okay
People are okay with it because they think that's what a good parent should do
You know, if a kid gets sick, sick, you put him in the other room and you lock him up and make sure that the other kids don't get sick
And they expect that out of the government
But when it is outside of China from America, it becomes a huge issue of the right political thing to do and whether it's infringing on personal freedom
So the issues that you have to deal with in the democratic society are issues that one does not have to deal with in China
I have to say that there is a word in Chinese that doesn't exist in any other language
And the word is called, Guay
It is what you call a kid who listens to his or her parents
So I think we are very, as a people, we are very Guay
We have this sort of authoritarian figure that Chinese always look up to and they do expect the government to actually take the actions and they will deal with it
However, much suffering there is, they feel that, okay, if big brother says that this has to be done, then it must be done
And that really defines China as a separate mentality
Chinese has a separate mentality as say, people in Europe and America
Not sense of collective responsibility, sometimes feels kind of a little absent from this culture
At the same time, there are, I think, valid concerns around surveillance and kind of data privacy, things like that
What is the balance here and what is the right trade-off between surveillance and freedom? I think in the internet age, it is somewhere between China and the US
I think when you take individual freedom versus collective safety, there has to be a balance somewhere there
With surveillance, you know, the head of Baidu, Robin Lee once said the Chinese people are quite willing to give up certain individual rights in exchange for convenience
Actually he was completely criticized on Chinese social media, but I think he is right
Chinese people are willing to give up certain rights
For example, we have Chinese mostly are very proud of the payment system
We have which is where you can't go anywhere, just with your iPhone and pay for everything and all they do is face scan
I think that probably freaks Americans out
You know, China right now, we're still under semi lockdown
So if you go anywhere, there's an app where you scan and you input your mobile phone number and the app will tell the guard at the entrance of the mall, for example, where you have been for the past 14 days
Now, when I told that to an American, She was horrified and she thought it was such an invasion of privacy
On the other hand, as someone who is Chinese and have lived in China for the past 20 years, although I understand that American mentality, I still find it, I'm Chinese enough to think, I don't mind this, and I am better, I feel safer entering the mall because everybody has, has been scanned
Whereas I think individual freedom as a abstract concept in a pandemic like this is actually really meaningless
So I think the West really need to move a step towards the East and to think about the collective as a whole rather than only think about oneself as an individual
The rise of antagonistic rhetoric between the US and China is obviously troubling
And the thing is that countries are interlinked whether people understand global supply chains or not
Whether you think we had next
You know, this is the most horrifying thing that came out of this, the kind of national holistic sentiments on both sides in this pandemic, because I'm an optimist, I think what will come out of this is that both sides will realize that this is a fight that the entire human race have to do together and not apart
Despite the rhetoric, the global economy has grown to such an integration that decoupling will be extremely costly and painful for both United States and China
It's also been interesting to me to see the criticism that China has received quite vocally
For instance, they've been criticised for downplaying the death toll arguably
Also for trying to demonize Dr Lee, the Wuhan doctor who first kind of raised their alarm about the coronavirus
I just saw a report in the New York Times that Weibo users have been posting repeatedly on the last post of Dr
Lee and kind of using this as a kind of a living memorial to him and chatting to him and there's something like 870,000 comments and growing on that last post
Do you see a change in the media? Do you see a change in the approach to Chinese leadership that actually could lead to China swinging perhaps more to the center, just as perhaps American needs to swing more towards a Chinese model
Unfortunately, not really, because I think there is a way between authoritarian governments and its people to communicate the night that Dr
Lee died
When it was announced that he died, the Chinese social media just blew up
Even though he was unjustly treated as a whistleblower, he still went to work in the hospital and tried to save lives as a doctor and then he died because he contracted a disease
So there was anger, frustration and all that came out in kind of commemorating a figure that they feel that the government had wronged the verdict and the sort of the official voice on who is Dr
Lee is here, good guy or bad guy completely changed 180 degrees
He went from a doctor who misbehaved to the hero who warned the people
So under authoritarian government, they They still are very aware of public opinion
But on the other hand, when people complain and when they commemorate Dr
Lee, do they really want to change the system? And my answer is no, because they don't like that particular decision, but they don't want to change the system
And one of the reasons is because they have never, ever known another system
This is the system they know how to work
What is work throwing? Oh, walk throwing is when you blame somebody else
Basically, someone who is responsible in a slang Chinese is someone who carries a black walk
You are made to be the scapegoat, to be for something that is bad
So basically Trump start calling it the Chinese virus, the Wuhan virus, and naming, trying to blame the entire coronavirus pandemic on the Chinese
And then the Chinese, I think, through the walk back at the American
So it was like a very funny joke on Chinese social media that walk throwing
There's a walk throwing, gymnastic aerobics exercise video that when viral, but tell us one, you're also doing dances on TikTok, right? Of course
I'm doing a lot of walk throwing a ribbed aerobics TikTok
I mean, a potential silver lining of all of this is that it has laid bare some of the, you know, inequities, inequalities in the system
Some of the broken structures that we have and if we're smart, we can rebuild better
Yes
I think one of the silver linings of this pandemic is that We do realize that human race have to do something together rather than to be distinguished by our race, by the color of our skin or by our nationality that this virus obviously is not discriminating against anyone, whether you're rich or poor, important or not important or whatever skin color or nationality you are
So it is a time to be together rather than to try to pull the world apart and crawl back to our old nationalistic shells
So beautiful sentiment, Huang Heng
Thank you so much for joining us from Beijing
Stay well, please
Thank you, Helen, and you stay well as well
