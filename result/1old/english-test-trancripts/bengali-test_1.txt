Nature reveals itself to us in unique ways
If we stop and look at the world through a window of time
Over the last decade, I've observed endangered species and habitats around the world, using a photographic technique that captures the passage of time, literally from day to night, all within a single image
It has allowed me to witness the fleeting moments between wildlife and the natural habitat as time changes over the course of a single day
In the Serengeti, during a five week drought, I discovered a watering hole, and watched for 26 hours, diverse and competitive wildlife, commonly share our planet's most precious resource
Water
On Lake Bagoria and Kenya, I photographed the Great Migration of Flamingos
This happens normally during the peak of dry season, But climate change has created even thunderstorms, turning normally dry hills green, and creating fresh water streams in which the flamingo is joyously bathed
Our planet is changing before our eyes, but the witness that change is also to witness the remarkable relationships between all of nature, to see the infinite beauty of it, to learn how much bigger than us it is, and why it is worth fighting for
In 2019, the Greenland Eye Sheet was experiencing its largest melt in recorded history
200 billion tons of ice liquified into the ocean
When Glacial Eye Smelts, caving icebergs released sediments and particles into the sea water, initiating our oceans' food chain, plankton feed on the sediment, crilly plankton, and the humpback whales feed on the crill
This photograph is the result of witnessing with my camera a 36-hour feast by humpback whales
We assume that the greatest threat of glacial melt will be sea-level rise, which will certainly have major impacts on coastlines and populations around the world
But within this image, we discover that perhaps the greatest threat from glacial melt might be our oceans ability to feed itself
Without ice, the ocean food chain may break
Creating this photograph open my consciousness
I hope through your willingness to look and see, it may open yours
Hello, how are you? It's nice to see you
I'm fine
You can see you too
So, John, we've got a big challenge
We need to get carbon out of the atmosphere
We need to stop a mid-carbon drive at to zero by 2050
We need to be halfway there by 2030
Where are we now? As you know, we're dumping 55 billion tons of carbon pollution in our precious atmosphere as fear every year is if it's some kind of free and open sewer, get halfway to zero by 2030
We're going to have to reduce annual emissions by about 10% a year
And we've never reduced annual emissions in any year in the history of the planet
So let's break this down
75% of the emissions come from the 20 largest invading countries and from four sectors of their economy
The first is grid, second transportation, the third from the buildings in the fourth from industrial activities
We've got to fix all those at speed and at scale
We do, and matters are in some ways worse than we think in some ways better
Let me start with a worse
Climate change is a wicked problem
And what do I mean by wicked problem? It means it's a problem that transcends geographic boundaries
The sources are everywhere in the impacts are everywhere, although obviously some nations have contributed much more than others
In fact, one of the terrible things about climate changes, those who contributed, at least to it, will be hurt the most
It's a great inequity machine
So here we have a problem that you cannot solve within the national boundaries of one country, and yet international institutions are notoriously weak
So that's part of the wicked problem
The second element of the wicked problem is it transcends normal time scales
We're used to news day by day or quarterly reports for business enterprises or an election cyclist about the longest we think anymore
Climate change essentially lasts forever
When you put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it's there or its impacts are there for a thousand years
It's a gift we keep on giving for our children, our parents and dozens and dozens of generations beyond that
That's like a tax we keep on paying
Yeah, it is
You've seen once you pay forever
And then the third element of it being a wicked problem is that carbon dioxide is embedded in every aspect of our industrial economy, every car, and every truck, and every airplane, and every house, and every electrical socket, and every industrial processes, now emits carbon dioxide
So what's the recipe? Well, here's the shortcut
If you decarbonize the grid, the electrical grid, and then run everything on electricity
Decarbonize the grid and electrify everything
If you do those two things, you have a zero carbon economy
Now that would seem like a pipe dream just a few years ago, because it was expensive to create a zero carbon grid
But the prices of solar and wind have plummeted
Solar is now the cheapest form of electricity on planet Earth and wind is second
It means now that you can convert the grid to zero carbon rapidly and save consumers money along the way
So there's leverage
Well, I think a key question, Hal, is do we have the technology that we need to replace fossil fuels to get this job done? And my answer is no
I think we're about 70, maybe 80% of the way there
For example, we urgently need a breakthrough in batteries
Our batteries need to be higher energy density
They need to have enhanced safety, faster charging
They need to take less space and less weight, and above all else, they need to cost a lot less
In fact, we need new chemistries that don't rely on scarce cobalt
And we're going to need lots of these batteries
We desperately need much more research in clean energy technology, the US invests about two and a half billion dollars a year
You know how much Americans spend on potato chips? The answer is four billion dollars
Now, what do you think of that? Up's like down
But let me press a little further
I'm going to question this fastening to me about the Silicon Valley
So the Silicon Valley is governed by Moore's law
We're performance doubles every 18 months
It's not really a law
It's an observation, but be that as it may
The energy world is governed by much more among the most important things
It's physical stuff in the economy
Sement trucks, factories, patterns, not bits
It's not bits, perfect
And the transformation of big physical things is slower, and the margins are worse, and often the commodities are generic
How do we stimulate the kind of innovation in those worlds that we actually need in order to save this planet Earth? Well, that's a really great question
The innovation starts with basic science and research and development and our the American commitment to that while advanced on a global sense is still poultry
It needs to be ten times higher than say two and a half billion per year that we spend on clean energy R&D
But we need to go beyond R&D as well
There needs to be a kind of development, a kind of pre-commercialization, which in the US is done by a group called ARPA E, then there's the matter of forming new companies
And I think entrepreneurial energy is shifting back into that field
It's clear that it takes longer and more capital, but you can build a really substantial and valuable enterprise or company
Tesla's a prime example of beyond meat is another one
And that's inspiring entrepreneurs globally
But that's not enough
I think you need also a demand signal and a form of policies and purchases from nations like Germany did with solar to go make these markets happen
And so I'm at hard of capitalist
I think this energy crisis is the mother of all markets and it will take longer
But the market for electric vehicle batteries, $500 billion a year
It's probably another $500 billion if you go to stationary batteries
I want to tell you another story that involves policy but importantly plans
Now Xinjiang is a city of 15 million people in innovative city in China and they decided that they were going to move to electric buses
And so they required all buses to be electric
In fact, they required parking spots
They have chargers associated with them
So today Xinjiang has 18,000 electric buses
It has 21,000 electric taxis, and this goodness didn't just happen
It was a result of a thoughtful, written five-year plan that is in just a kind of campaign bramus
Executing against these plans is how mayors get promoted or fired, and so it's really deadly serious
It has to do with carbon and has to do with health, with jobs, and with overall economic strength
bottom line is that China today has 420,000 electric buses
America has less than 1,000
So what are their national projects? Are there that you'd like to see? So this is a global effort, but not everybody is going to do the same thing or should do the same thing
Let me start with Norway
Country that happens to be brilliant at offshore oil, but also understands the consequences of burning more oil
They realize they could deploy their skills from their offshore oil development into offshore wind
It's a big deal to put wind turbines out in the ocean
The ocean, the winds are much stronger and the winds are much more constant not only stronger, so it balances the grid beautifully, but it's really hard to build things in the deep ocean
You're always good at it
So let them take that on
Are they taking it on? They are actually
Yeah, it's pretty brilliant
Another example, India, there are hundreds of millions of people in India that don't have access to electricity
With the advances in solar and advances in batteries, there's no reason they have to build the grid to all those villages that don't have a grid
Skip the steps, skip the dirty steps, leapfrog to clean
But this all comes together in my opinion in the realm of policy
We need dramatic accelerances what you're saying, accelerants in R&D but also accelerants into deployment
Deployment is innovation because deployment drives prices down
The right policy can turn things around and we've seen it happen already in the electricity sector
So electricity regulators have asked for ever cleaner sources of electricity, more renewables less coal, less natural gas, and it's working
It's working pretty brilliantly, actually, but it's not enough
So the German government recognized the possibility of driving down the price of clean energy
And so they put in orders on the books
They agreed to pay an extra price for early phases of solar energy, presuming the price would drop
They created the demand signal using policy
The Chinese created a supply signal, also using policy
They decided that solar was a strategic part of their future economy
And so you had this unwritten agreement between the two countries, one buying a lot, the other producing a lot that helped drive the price down 80%
We should be doing that with 10 technologies, or it doesn't around the world
We need policy as the magic sauce to go through those four sectors in the biggest countries, in all countries
And one of the things that animates me is that this requires people who are concerned about climate change, which should be everybody
Those folks have to apply their energies on the policies that matter with the decision makers who matter
If you don't know who the decision makers to decarbonize the grid or to produce electric vehicles in the policy world, you're really not in the game
Hal, you're an expert in policy
I know this because I've read your book
Designing climate solutions
What makes for good policy? You know there are some secrets here and they're really important if we want a self-climate change
Let me give you two of the secrets
The first thing is you have to go where the tons are
Follow the tons
Follow the tons and this is such an obvious idea but it's amazing how many policies tinker around the edges
I call a green paint
We don't need green paint
We need green substance
The second thing is when you set a policy insist on continuous improvement
So what does that mean? Back in In 1978, Jerry Brown was a youngest governor in California's history and he implemented a thermal building code, which means when you build a building it has to have insulation in it pretty simple idea
But he put a trick into that law
He said, every three years, the code gets tighter and tighter and tighter and how do you know how much tighter anything that pays for self and energy savings gets thrown into the code? So, in the intervening years, we got better insulation, better windows, better furnaces, better roofing
Today, a new California building uses 80% less energy than a pre-code building
And Jerry Brown used his legislative bandwidth once to draft that policy that produces fruits forever
You got the words right
You got the words right
Continuous improvement
There's a counter example which should be instructive as well
So you and I are both of an age where we remember the first oil embargo and the energy crisis that caused with stagnation and inflation at the same time
Gerald Ford was president and he realized that if we could double the fuel efficiency of new vehicles, we could cut and half their energy use
So he signed a lot of double the fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in America
From 13 miles per gallon, absolutely pathetic to 26 miles per gallon
That's big
It's pathetic by today's standards, but it was a big deal then, right? It was double
But by setting a number as the goal, We created a 25-year plateau
So imagine if instead he said this will, filificiency will increase at 4% a year forever
So how? Goals are great things
How do you find the policy makers that set these goals? And then how do you influence them? Well, so that's maybe the most important question of law
If we have a lot of concern about climate change and it's not properly aimed, it just dissipates
It's a one day headline about a march, and that's not going to get the job done
In every sector, in every country there's a decision maker, and it's usually not the senator or the president
It's usually an air quality regulator or a public utilities commissioner
These are the people that have the secret knobs on the energy of the economy
They're the ones that get to decide whether we get cleaner and cleaner energy, more and more efficient buildings, more and more efficient cars, and so forth
How many of these people are there in an economy like the US? The electric utilities are monopolies and so they're regulated by utilities
Commissions, otherwise they jack up the price too high
Every state has a utilities commission, a public utilities commission
These commissions typically have five members
So that's about 250 people in America who control the future of our grid
None of them is a senator, none of them is a governor
They're appointed positions
How much carbon do they control? 40% of the carbon in the economy
Wow
250 people
250 individuals
Now, you can narrow that down even more
So let's go for the 30 biggest states, because this is all about tons, right? You're not on to 150 individuals
And if you're content to win votes on a three to two bases, you're down to 90 individuals who control almost half the carbon in the economy
How do you make sure those 90 people vote for a clean energy grid? They have a quasi-judicial process
They hold hearings
They take evidence
They consider what they're allowed to do within the statutory framework
And then they make a decision
They have to look at human health
They have to look at economics
They have to look at reliability
And they have to look at greenhouse gases
Is there a breakthrough you'd like to see or an innovation you're particularly excited about? I'm keen on green hydrogen
I mean, we need to drive down the cost of electrolysis
And it's always going to be more expensive than just pure electricity
It's a thermodynamic certainty
But once you have hydrogen, you can reform it with other chemicals into liquid fuels, like synthetic diesel for airplanes or long haul trucks or ships
You can use it to make fertilizers
And we can rethink the basics of chemistry
Chemistry is built on hydrocarbons, and we need to build it on carbohydrates instead
It's a different kinds of molecules, but it's not impossible
I guess the other thing that's fascinating to me is this term stranded investment
So if you want a coal-fired power plant or coal mine today, anywhere in the world, you have stranded your money
You can't get it back because they're on economic
We analyzed every coal plant in America, the economics of everyone, and 75% of them, it's cheaper to shut them down and replace them with a brand new winter solar farm than just pay the operating cost of that coal plant
So what's going to get stranded next? This is an important question
I think natural gas is next
It's already skating along at low prices
I think people who are putting a lot of money into gas fields right now or gas turbines right now are going to rule the day
John, what are some of the innovations or breakthroughs that you're especially excited about? Well, one exciting development comes from my friend and hero, Al Gore, who has the vision and is working with entrepreneurs that by integrating data can produce for every place on the planet a new real-time estimate of what their carbon emissions are
You know I come from the school of measuring what matters
Yes, you do
If we had a real-time kind of Google Earth where we could zoom in to individual factories or oil fields or Walmart stores, I think that could really change the game
I'm also a believer in carbon accounting
And so I've seen entrepreneurs who are making systems that will allow not just the owners, but all the employees of an enterprise or organization to see what's in their carbon supply chain
Yep
I'd love to see legislation that required the OMB score every piece of legislation for its carbon impact
Yes
If we're serious about this, we're going to measure what matters
You measure what really matters
Yeah
So let's talk about Paris in the Paris Accord because some people say that some nations are ahead of their plans, but others are not and that the agenda is not aggressive enough
It's not going to get us where we need to go
What is your view of the Paris Accords? The Paris Accords are quite interesting animals
It's not a national commitment, it's not a national commitment, it's not an international commitment
They're not binding
They're not binding
They're individually determined national contributions
That's the term of art that they use in the Paris Accord
So what does that mean? So that means Europe says we're going to do 40% less carbon in 2030 than we did in 1990, for example
If they fail to hit that number, there's no consequences
If they go past that number, there's no consequences
However, does not mean that Paris Accordes are not important
They're really important because they set up, I would call it a race to the top instead of a race to the bottom
They set up a dynamic where people were sort of bidding to do better and better
They create a transparency in how people are doing in terms of their carbon emissions
And there are some countries that take these commitments very seriously, and including the European Union and China on that list
So I'm going to push on this and what we really need is we need a plan
So elaborate
Well, I think what we have today are goals
Not a plan and I think a plan would be a set of 20 focused precision policy efforts each of whom's targeted at the right decision maker or makers in the right venues for these 20 largest nations and the four sectors of their economy
In these precision campaigns would be well funded
They'd be well focused
They'd have an awesome founder, CEO, leader, an amazing staff of people, an accountable set of objectives and key results
And beyond a timeline, we would measure their progress, quarter by quarter
That would give me hope that we'll get where we need to go by 2030
How about you? Let me add on a couple characteristics to exactly what you just said
And that is you need to have a deep understanding of who the decision maker is, ideally by person, certainly by position
And we exactly understand exactly what motivates them or hinders them in making this decision
So that you can put all your forces on the decision maker at point of decision
It's one thing to have a general concern about the environment or about climate
It's quite another to focus that concern on the most important decisions on the planet
And that's what we need to do
I love this idea
Okay, so focus on the decision makers
I think there's other individual action that we can and must take
We've got to amplify your voice so that you organize, activate, cross-litize, your company, your neighbors, youth
I think are an incredibly powerful voice and friends
You need to vote
Yep
You need to vote like your life depends on it
Yep
So hell
What does this all add up to? What's the takeaway? I'm an optimist, John
I've seen this possible
I've seen when nations decide to do great things
They can do great things
Think of America's rural electrification or the interstate highway system we built
Those are huge projects that transform the country
But we did prepping for World War II
We built 300,000 airplanes in four years
So if we decide to do something, or when the Germans are the Chinese or the Indians decide to do something other countries, they can get it done
But if this is sort of pifling around the edges, we won't get there
What do you think? Are you optimistic? My take on this is I may not be optimistic, but I'm hopeful
I really think the crucial question is, can we do what we must at speed and at scale? The good news is it's now clearly cheaper to save the planet than to ruin it
The bad news is we are fast running out of time
Any reality we are given is not set in stone
It can be changed
I come from Costa Rica, a country known for our deep commitment to peace, our high level of education, and our far-sighted stewardship of nature
But it wasn't always like that
Way back in the forties, my father, Josefía de Espíritu, was a young farmer, telling the soil of these mountains and cultivating his vision of a country grounded in social justice and guided by the rule of law
His vision was tested when in 1948 the government refused to accept the result of democratic elections and brought in the military
My father could have been indifferent but he chose to do what was necessary to restore democracy
surviving the burning of his home and his farm
From here he launched a revolutionary army of a few courageous men and women who against all odds defeated the government forces
Then he disbanded his army outlawed the national army and redirected the military budget to establish the basis of the unique country Costa Rica is today
From my father, I learned stubborn optimism
The mindset that is necessary to transform the reality we're given into the reality we want
Today, at the global level, we face a rapidly accelerating climate emergency, daunting because we have procrastinated way too long
We now have one last chance to truly change our course
This is the decisive decade in the history of humankind
That may sound like an exaggeration, but it's not
If we continue on the current path, we condemn our children and their descendants to a world that is increasingly unenhappitable, with exponentially growing levels of disease, famine and conflict, and irreversible ecosystem failures
Conversely, if we cut our current greenhouse gas emissions in half over the next 10 years, we open the door to an exciting world where cities are green, the air is clean, energy and transport are efficient, jobs in a fair economy are abundant and forest soil and waters are regenerated
Our world will be safer and healthier, more stable and more just than what we have now
This decade is a moment of choice unlike any we have ever lived
All of us alive right now share that responsibility and that opportunity
There are many changes to make over the next 10 years
And each of us will take different steps along the way
But all of us start the transformation in one place, our mindset
Faced with today's facts, we can be indifferent, do nothing, and hope the problem goes away
we can despair and plunge into paralysis, or we can become stubborn optimists with a fierce conviction that no matter how difficult we must, and we can rise to the challenge
Optimism is not about blindly ignoring the realities that surround us, that's foolishness
It's also not a naive faith that everything will take care of itself, even if we do nothing
that is irresponsibility
The optimism I'm speaking of is not the result of an achievement
It is the necessary input to meeting a challenge
It is in fact the only way to increase our chance of success
Think of the impact of a positive mindset on a personal goal you have set yourself
Running a marathon, learning a new language, creating a new country like my father, or like me, reaching a global agreement on climate change
The Paris Agreement of 2015 is hailed as a historical breakthrough
We started in order gloom when I assumed leadership of the International Climate Change negotiations in 2010, six months after the failed Copenhagen meetings, the world was in a very dark place on climate change
no one believed we would ever agree on global decarbonization
Not even I believed it was possible
But then I realized a shared vision and a globally agreed route toward that vision was indispensable
It took a deliberate change of mindset first in me and then in all other participants who gradually but courageously moved from despair to determination, from confrontation to collaboration until we collectively delivered the global agreement
But we have not moved fast enough
Many now believe it is impossible to cut global emissions in half in this decade
I say, we don't have the right to give up or let up
optimism means envisioning our desired future and then actively pulling it closer
Optimism opens the field of possibility
It drives your desire to contribute to make a difference
It makes you jump out of bed in the morning because you feel challenged and hopeful at the same time
But it isn't going to be easy
We will stumble along the way
Many other global urgencies could temper our hope for rapid progress, and our current geopolitical reality could easily dampen our optimism
That's where stubbornness comes in
Our optimism cannot be a sunny day attitude
It has to be gritty, determined, relentless
It is a choice we have to make every single day
barrier must be an indication to try a different way
In radical collaboration with each other, we can do this
For years, I had a recurring nightmare in which I saw seven pairs of children's eyes, the eyes of seven generations
Steering back at me, asking, what did you do? Now we have millions of children in the streets asking us adults the same question
What are you doing? And we have to respond
Like our fathers and mothers before us
We are the farmers of the future
I invite each of you to ask yourself, what is the future you want? what are you doing to make that future a reality? You will each have a different answer, but you can all start by joining the growing family of stubborn optimists around the world
Welcome to the Family
So the gods send a message to an old king
We will disguise you so that you can enter the enemy camp, find your son's killer, and then you can try and run some your dead son's body back off him
When the king tells his queen, she is terrified
Don't go! Man slaying Achilles will kill you too
But then the old man, King Prime of Troy, says something strange and wonderful but difficult for our generation to fully comprehend
I don't care if the Greeks kill me, just as long as I first have the heart comforting embrace of my dead son in my arms
My dead son in my arms doesn't the old man know that the bodies of the dead are worthless, his quest pointless who would risk their life for a corpse
The story comes from book 24 of the Iliad, a foundation work of Western civilisation, written by Homer in 700 BC, about a war that took place in 1,300 BC
The siege of Troy, a bardic poem that was memorized, recited and performed for thousands of years
You heard the sound of the Iliad cascade through your ears and in that retelling
you readiscovered the ancient life and death wisdom of our ancestors
How to be brave and sorrow, how to face your own death with courage, how to teach your children how to die, how to be a better mortal, a better human
Horse-hoigam, ipan, tapan, hectoros, hipo-domoio
The very last line in ancient Greek of the Iliad itself, a wisdom that we have willfully forgotten and lost in our newish self-centered fear of death
In contrast, we have subcontracted our mortality out
Modern death absurdly has become a medical specialist, palliative care, a foreign country we never visit, are only at the end of our own lives, the ultimate form of death denial
Just as we have forbidden ourselves, not only the embrace, but the very sight of our own dead
for bidden
We'll show you take a test
Can you take the fingers of your right hand? Yeah? You? Everyone? And count off the number of corpses that you have seen, touched, kissed, and embraced in your entire life
One or two? Or none? Will your corpse count make it to the fingers of your left hand? And how could that be in a world where everyone is mortal? On our TV screens, we would pixelate out that final act of her merit love, the dead hector in his father's arms, on the grounds of taste, and public decency, and the advertising revenue
But our existential flight has not made us stronger, our wiser, more death courageous, just, more fearful
We're far too sad, too frightened of our own death
Our conception of death has narrowed to an eye thing, never an hour thing
The tern they ill are often ashamed of their sickening and height from sight
We are embarrassed about what to say to a colleague who has lost someone they love
Embarrassed by our mortality, worried that if we say anything, we will make them more sad
And sad, of course, is bad
The pleasures of sorrow, grieving openly together are unrecognizable to us, though they are often cited in the Iliad, along with motherly advice to have more sex as a form of grief therapy, advice which speaking from personal experience can do a grieving soul, a world of good
We are more afraid of dying than those warriors on the plains of Troy, more conquered by death
And of course you always would be more sad and more afraid if you believe that you will only ever face death alone and enter a once in a death time experience, a may death never a we death
But what about if you train for death the same way that we all train to drive a car, taking lessons often in structure, going on little laps around your local neighborhood, sitting a whole series of tests, which even if you failed, you'd get to reset again
A common social experience, a right of passage
It doesn't sound hard, doesn't? Now, if you've never been to a Trojan wake or a Ny-Rish version of the same thing, And only seeing the movie, you're probably thinking it's just another Irish piss up
A few drunks in some dank bar lamenting their dead uncle Johnny, who they buried that morning
But you would be dead wrong
Wakes are the oldest rights of humanity
When I was seven, my mother took me to meet my first corpse, a wake on the island of our ancestors
An old man with hairy nostrils, line and a box, who I instinctively knew, wasn't sleeping
Even then, in her maternal care, she was teaching her boy to overcome the fear of death, just as her community had overcome their fear together thousands of years
My family have lived in the same village on a island of the coast of County Mail in Ireland for the last 250 years
A real wake has got a real dead body, a dead one of us
Now they don't say much, but you sure can learn a lot in their company
Every human being who you have ever touched before, in love or anger, is a warm blooded mammal
But the dead are so cold they could be carved from marble
Later in life, when I took my own dead brother Bernard, in my arms, and kissed and embraced And with him, I could not at first believe that this stone-cold mannequin had ever been human
And here's another existential epiphany
As you are sitting here listening to me, your heart is pumping blood
But when you cut that pump, the pressure disappears
The blood flows to the lower limbs, your cheek sag, your face turns grey, your bloodless fingers, a yellow ivory, and the great animating current of personality, like the ignition on your car is just gone
So what happens then? Yeah? What we shouldn't do and what our ancestors didn't do is then say something stupid, like, That's just a shell, forget about it
The being that you loved in life never existed outside that body
And if you loved that person in life, how should you not rever and respect their body in death? The Romans, the Celts, the Greeks, revered their dead
Like a newborn child, the dead, were never to be left alone
And always had someone to watch over them until they were laid to rest
Sad was good too
There was no shame in sorrow at the gates of Troy, even man slaying Achilles' wet until his breastplate was wet with tears and women cried and grieved openly at funerals
the bodies of the dead, where of worth
Together, our ancestors enacted a whole raft of rituals to bind up the wind of mortality, comfort the afflicted, bury their dead, and get on with the rest of their lives
They gave of themselves freely, and they had a great time too, feasting, drinking, and having sex, Funeral's death and here is a really big idea
Was and is an every other day sort of event
Just as it is in Ireland today, where people still go in great numbers to wicks and funeral's and an ordinary person might see dozens, maybe hundreds of dead bodies in the course of their lifetime
Now, funerals can be sad
But there is nothing abstract or sentimental about an Irish wake
The old woman in the box that read here, child wrapped up in a shroud, is another dead human, another one of us wrapped up though in these corpse and cremting rituals
are a lot of profound protocols
You see, at that week, you know, this is what death looks like
This is what death is
You can reach into the coffin and touch
And those protocols allow you to do things
So for instance, there is a licensing of grief being angry, tearful, grieving, crying
a recognition of irrevocable change in the very public deadness of the deceased, a communal acknowledgement of bereavement and loss, an unflinching mortal solidarity, a we-death, not a me-death
Sharing the company of the dead, at-weights, and funerals was our foremothers, mortality driving lessons
They're how to live and die manual with a list of embedded instructions like how being mortal is the one thing in life that you will never get to choose, how thinking that your immortal is a foolish idea, how the pleasures of sorrow open public grief can heal up a wounded soul and how together we can conquer our fear of death
Sounds good, eh? But I wonder is anyone thinking it will never work in today's America? I don't know who my next or neighbors are, families are scattered, there's no community's left to do these weight things with
But again, you would be dead wrong
We all have the power as individuals to reenact the wisdom of our ancestors
Confundated in our mortality, we often feel powerless, death struck
But all you need to do is rediscover yourself
Be a bit more Irish, if you like
Maybe you just never recognized yourself as part of the same mortal community, but it is easy to reconnect if you want to try
Not because you're being altruistic, but for purely selfish reasons, free dying lessons
Who else did you expect would teach you how to die apart from another dying human
All you have to do is overcome your fear, using the tools that you already have in your hands, like your phones
So on the day that you hear that someone has lost someone they love, you don't wait, but you reach out then with that phone and call them up and say, I'm sorry for your loss
Our go visit the sick and dying, and try to be there for the moment of death for the witness and the wonder
Nothing else that you will ever do in life will be more profound or more life affirming
Or go to more funerals
Even if you think you don't know the dead person that well, I can assure you as long as you are breathing, you know them well enough
Give of yourself freely because even by these small steps you will be recognizing yourself as part of the great mortal us
Just as human, just as vulnerable, as all the lives around you
Death matters because life matters and the two are indivisible
Don't worry if you feel awkward at first, practice, practice, practice, and till it's just like getting in that car and going and you don't even think about it
Though your own death will take you a whole lifetime to get right
So after I gave up on going to foreign wars and the maturity of youth, I turned a barric put
And I wrote this praise song in honor of my island mothers who for thousands of years never faltered to cradle the dead to rest
It's called if I could sing
If I could sing, I would not sing of the fallen city of Elias and Glorys gone or Hector's blood, dried and stained in sand
No, I would sing of an island far out to the west, rising sea-plot spray-lash, a citadel of stone, walled deep in the blue ocean, another Troy, an Irish Troy, closer to the sinking sun, unconscored
If you could hear this song, you too would listen in rapture to the emerald kinsha, keening women, crying out grieving heart struck in eternal chorus at the wick, with a last best hope of humanity beats on, that mortal being incarnate and flesh shall not live love or die alone
And if I could sing, if we could sing together, my brothers and sisters, surely then we should never stop the singing of this song
Thank you
Thank you
Hi, my name is Andrés Nerd Magnason, talking from Iceland
In 2019, we had lost our first glacier to climate change
The oak, the oak glacier that is not okay anymore
And in the next 200 years, we expect all our glaciers to follow the same path
This glacier here is one of them
Solem and Jokut in the South Coast of Iceland
A rather poem for a plaque that was placed on the mountain where Jokut once stood
It was a letter to the future, and it says, this monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done, only you know if we did it
My grandparents, they were glacial explorers at times when the glaciers seemed eternal
They went on a glacial honeymoon in the year 1956
For three weeks, they were mapping and travelling Vatna Yukut, Europe's biggest glacier
keeping intense in extreme temperatures and they asked them once, once you cold and they said cold, we would just married
My grandmother just turned 96 and now we know that many glaciers will be gone within a time someone is born today becoming as old as my grandmother is now
We need to start connecting to the future intimate and urgent way
My grandmother, she was born in the year 1924 and if I have grant children the people I will love the most in my life will still be alive in the year 2,150
Because our time is the time of the people that we know and love the time that created us and our time is also the time of the people that we will know and love the time that we create
We can easily span 230 years, the handshake of generations
When a scientist says 2,100, we just shrug, we don't feel connected
But I asked my grandmother, are 100 years a long time or a short time
And she said to my surprise, it's a short time
I feel like I was traveling the glaciers yesterday
So 2,100 is not a distant future
It's basically tomorrow because in the mind of those people, 2020 will be yesterday
And I'm quite sure that we want them to look at our time with pride and gratitude because we knew what was happening and we know what needs to be done and we actually eventually did the right thing
Thank you
As last recorded by the U
S
federal government, the median wealth for a white family in the United States was $171,000 in the median wealth for a black family was just $17,000, a 10x difference over 150 years after the end of slavery
I think first we have to ask ourselves what is wealth really? Well, wealth is all of your assets, all of the things that you own minus all of your liabilities
that there are things like your car, your house, your savings account, your checking account, your investments, if you own other properties, your business
Well, that gap, that 10x gap is partially because for many years, decades in fact, black Americans were left off of that ladder and didn't really have access to it
Well, why are we talking about this now? Well, in 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic and a looming recession, inequities were really laid bare across nearly every system in the United States, healthcare, education, criminal justice, and finance
And people were moved to take action online in streets, in meetings at work, and corporate boardrooms
And I, as a consultant, started having conversations with clients that I thought I would never have
Well, I guess the question that I've been asking myself is, how do we make sure that in this moment, this results in action in progress? that starts to close that wealth gap for black versus white Americans
So who am I? My name is Kendra Newsom Reeves
I'm a consultant again for banking institutions, hedge funds, asset managers
But before any of that, I'm a black American who's the descendant of slaves
And we talk about the wealth gap that's really important to understand the history
So I thought I'd tell a little story about a family, my family, and how policy intersects with wealth
So I'll start to think great, great, grandfathers
He was a man named Silas Newsom, and Silas was born a slave outside Nashville, Tennessee, on a new sensation where he and his family worked on a quarry
He didn't know anything
He didn't own his home
He didn't own property
He didn't really even own his own body, his own labor, his children, any of those things
All of those things were here to create wealth for someone else
So we believe that he was a servant during the Civil War for a Confederate general
who was actually fighting to keep him enslaved, so he really had no wealth, he had no control over his life
While the end of slavery, there was a policy opportunity
There is a question, what do we do for the hundreds of years of slavery now that we are ending slavery in the countries coming together? And there was a choice, we could make a settlement with the slaves or we could make a settlement with the slave owners
Well, the slaves had no power to advocate for themselves in that moment, and the country had to be united to the federal government decided to give that settlement to slave owners, essentially giving them money for the property that they had lost at the end of the war
And not their physical property, not their homes, but people, the slaves that had provided free labor for years and decades
So Silas at the end of the Civil War had no wealth
He was free, but had no wealth
He became a sheer cropper
My great-grandfather Silas was born a number of years after the end of slavery
And he was drafted to serve in World War I, along with 350,000 other black American soldiers in segregated units
He served in the war when he came back to United States, at the end of the war, it was a very anti-black sentiment
The economy was compressing, there are a lot of stressors
And black people could not get land, they could not get loans for homes
They really could not acquire any credit to build wealth over time
so he also became a farmer
And he had a son, also named Silas, there were a lot of Silas in my family
My grandfather, my grandfather Silas was also a soldier and fought in World War II
After World War II, the US federal government passed the GI Bill, which provided support for veterans
And the bill provided for building of hospitals, student loans, and most importantly, for wealth building, low interest home mortgages for veterans
And the years following the war, the GI Bill accounted for $4 billion of funding to $9 million veterans, but black veterans largely did not benefit
So Siles, my grandfather, came back to Nashville, Tennessee and he married my grandmother, whose name is Cinderella, yes, my grandmother's name is Cinderella, and they had eight children, they never bought a home
In the highlight of their housing journey was moving into a new public housing project with their children and paying rent for that housing project, which in terms of the quality of housing was fantastic for them and a step up, but did not allow them to build wealth
My father, another soldier, a 20-year veteran of the United States Marines, bought his first home in his early 50s, but it took four generations for our family to move into home ownership and begin to build ownership in equity in a home
That's one family story, and I skipped a lot of things that happened between the end of slavery and today, redlining, housing discrimination before the Fair Housing Act in the 1970s
They're really important role that black owned banks played in building black communities
The savings alone crisis of the 1980s, which crushed a lot of black banks and the sub-prime crisis in 2008, which stripped a lot of black and brown homeowners of their homes
There's a lot of history there, but that story tells you a bit about how we get to this Tenak's gap where we are today
Now, certainly as we think about the size of that gap, it is critical for the federal government to take a number of actions
That side-fighting institutions play a really important role in providing access to credit, access to capital, to build communities and allow black communities to thrive
We have to be clear, managing $17,000 better does not get us there
Better education does not get us there
Access to credit and capital are critical
So I want to talk about four solutions today that financial institutions can contribute to start to close the wealth gap
Number one is getting more people on the ladder
getting more people banked
We know today that about half of black Americans are unor under banked
Unbanked means that you don't have a bank account
Underbanked means that you have the bank account, but you use alternative services for checkcashing or payday lending or paying bills
And months not to six-pensive from a transaction perspective in terms of the fees that you pay, it's also expensive in terms of the time that you commit to paying a bill
Think about how you pay your utility bill today
Probably comes out of your checking account
You don't even think about it
You set it up in advance and it's automatic
Well, if you're unbanked, you are probably going to get a money-water somewhere, physically, a piece of paper
You then travel to City Hall or DMV to pay that bill
About 40% of people who are unbanked say they are unbanked because they think they don't have the minimum amount to really maintain a checking account
Well, that's just not true
In the last several years, credit unions, community banks, and major banking institutions have created low cost, no minimum checking in savings account products, specifically made for this population
So we have an issue with awareness
Banks, community partners, and others have to work together to increase the awareness of these products and communities that need them so we can start to reduce the number of people that are on and underbank and get them on the ladder that we talked about earlier
The challenge is about 28% of black and Latinx families are credit invisible, which means that you have a thin credit file or no credit file
The way that credit works and credit worldliness assessments work is to say, if you can prove that you have paid credit back consistently previously, then I can lend you more credit
It's kind of a chicken or an egg situation
The interesting thing is that being some financial technology companies have really innovated and recent years to use alternative data, cable, bills, utility bills, rent payments, etc
to show that you're able to consistently make payments
The additional challenge on this one, unlike the last one which was more about awareness, is that you need to have regulatory support to do these things
You need to prove to regulators that you're able to fairly use alternative data to lend credit to marginalized groups
What we need to see is from the federal government and the banking industry to come together to create innovation sandboxes to start to use alternative data to expand to marginalized groups
What about communities? Without a community wealth, individual wealth and a way is on an island
And if you go into most major cities, the United States, to most communities of color, well, you'll find is under-invested communities
For For every economic crisis these communities have suffered severely for every economic boom they have not benefited
And so what we're seeing in a number of cities across the country and all you should call those an example is the partnerships occurring between banking institutions, philanthropy, the city and community leaders to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to build community resources and communities that have historically been disinvested
Lastly, we've got to talk about business, and not just small businesses
Now, when you have individual stability and a banking institution, you have access to credit, and when you have community wealth, those are all fantastic things, but we need also job creation
Take all of the new tech companies, and I say new quote unquote, because now they're not so new, but take Facebook, Google, Amazon
It's some point all of those companies or silver prider ships with one employee or a few employees that were building a technology that was not yet proven
What those companies received early on was venture capital money
And when you look at venture capital today, only one percent of venture capital funds go to black founders
So with black entrepreneurs who are just shut out of those networks, they're not able to grow
And the only way for that to change is from within the industry itself
This generationary must not only be talking about thriving businesses and black communities
You must also be talking about seeing more black owned and founded businesses going public
And those are just four solutions
There's many other things that can and should be done to close the wealth gap
This gap is not new
It was born and perpetuated by federal policy, social constructs and business practice over time, and all of those things need to change to start to close the gap
Financial institutions play a really critical role of the individual level at the community level and at the business level
It's important to our families, it's important to our communities, and it's important to our economy
Instead of talking about how the gap continues to grow, let's begin to close the gap now
Thank you
It's time for humankind to recognise a disturbing truth
We have colonised the future
In wealthy countries especially we treat it like a distant colonial outpost where we can freely dump ecological damage and technological risk as if there was nobody there
The tragedy is that tomorrow's generations aren't here to challenge this pillaging of their inheritance
They can't leap in front of the King's horse like a suffragette, or stages sit in like a civil rights activist or go in a salt march to defy their colonial oppressors like Mahatma Gandhi
They're granted no political rights or representation
They have no influence in the marketplace
The great silent majority of future generations is rendered powerless
Now, it can be hard to grasp the scale of this injustice
So look at it this way
There are 7
7 billion people alive today
As such as the tiny fraction of the estimated 100 billion people who have lived and died over the past 50,000 years
But both of these are vastly outnumbered by nearly 7 trillion people who will be born over the next 50,000 years as human birth rates stabilise
In the next two centuries alone, tens of billions of people will be born
Amongst them, all your grandchildren, and their grandchildren, and the friends and communities on whom they'll depend
How will all these future generations look back on us and the legacy we're leaving for them? We've clearly inherited extraordinary legacies from our common ancestors
The gift of the agricultural revolution, medical discoveries and the cities we still live in, but we've certainly inherited destructive legacies too
Legacies of slavery and colonialism and racism, creating deep inequities that must now be repaired
Reggae sees a economy that is structurally addicted to fossil fuels and endless growth that must now be transformed
So how can we become the good ancestors that future generations deserve? Well over the past decade, a global movement has started to emerge of people committed to decolonizing the future and extending our time horizons towards a longer now
This movement is still fragmented and is yet has no name
I think of its pioneers as time rebels
They can be found at work in Japan's visionary future design movement, which aims to overcome the short-term cycles that dominate politics by drawing on the principle of seventh-generation decision making, practiced by many native American communities
Future design gathers together residents to draw up and discuss plans for the towns and cities where they live
Half the group are told, their residents from the present day
The other half are given ceremonial robes to wear and told to imagine themselves as residents from the year 2060
Well it turns out that the residents from 2060 systematically advocate far more transformative city plans from healthcare investments to climate change action
And this innovative form of future citizens assembly is now spreading throughout Japan from small towns like Yajabba to major cities like Kyoto
What a future design was adopted by towns and cities worldwide to revitalize democratic decision-making and extend their vision far beyond the now
Now, time rebels have also taken to courts of law to secure the rights of future people
The organisation, our children's trust is filed a landmark case against the US government on behalf of 21 young people campaigning for the legal right to a safe climate and healthy atmosphere for both current and future generations
David Vs
Colleis struggle has already inspired groundbreaking lawsuits worldwide from Colombia and Pakistan to Uganda and the Netherlands
And this wave of activism is growing alongside the movement to grant legal personhood to nature
From the Wanganui River in Altairro and New Zealand, to the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India
Time rebels are taking action at the ballot box too
In 2019, teenagers across Europe began lobbying med parents and grandparents to give them their votes in the European parliamentary elections of that year
The hashtag give the kids your vote when viral on social media and was spread by climate campaign as far as Australia
My partner and I heard about it and decided to give our votes in the last UK general election to our 11 year old twins
So we all sat around the kitchen table and debated the party manifestos and they then each told us where to put the X on the ballot sheet
And in case you want to no, they didn't simply mirror their parents' political opinions
So the time rebellion has begun
The rebels arising to decolonize the future, finding a global movement for long-term thinking and intergenerational justice that may turn out to be one of the most powerful political movements of this century
They're helping us escape the short-term cycles that digital distraction and consumer culture trappers in, with a lure of the buy-and-out button and 24-7 news
They inspire us to to extend our time horizons from seconds and minutes to decade and far beyond
The artist Katie Paterson's project Future Library will be a century in the making
Every year a famous writer donates a book which will remain completely unread until 2114 when the whole collection will be printed on paper made from a forest of trees planted for this very purpose
The Spalbard Global Seval sets its vision even further, housing millions of seeds in an indestructible rock bunker in the Arctic Circle that's designed to last a thousand years
But how can we really think and plan on the scale of millennia? Well, the answer is perhaps the ultimate secret to being a time rebel and it comes from the biomemicrodesignar genine beniors who suggest we learn from nature's 3
8 billion years of evolution
How is it that other species of have learned to survive and thrive for 10,000 generations or more, well it's by taking care of the place that will take care of their offspring
By living within the ecosystem in which they're embedded
By knowing not to file the nest, which is what humans have been doing with devastating effects at an ever increasing pace and scale over the past century
So a profound starting point for time rebels everywhere is to focus not simply on lengthening time, but on regenerating place
We must restore and repair and care for the planetary home that will take care of our offspring
For our children and our children's children, and all those yet to come, we must fall in love with rivers and mountains, with ice sheets and savannas, and reconnect with the long and life-giving cycles of nature
Let us all become time-rabbles, and be inspired by the the beautiful Mohawk blessing spoken when a child is born
Thank you Earth
You know the way
Over the decades, my colleagues and I have exposed terrible misdeeds and crimes by large corporations, which have taken many lives and caused injuries and diseases
On top of damaging economic costs, affecting many incidents
But exposure was not enough
We had to secure a congressional mandate to prevent such devastation
As a result, many lies were saved and many traumas prevented in, especially in the areas of automobile, pharmaceutical and environmental, and workplace health and safety
Along the way, we kept getting one question again and again
Ralph, how do you do all this? Your groups are small, your funds are modest, and you don't make campaign contributions to politicians
My response points to an overlooked, amazing pattern of American history
Just about every advance in justice, every blessing of democracy came from the efforts of small numbers of individual citizens
They knew what they were talking about
They expanded public opinion, or whatever I'm Lincoln called, the All-Important Public sentiment
The few citizens who started these movements and listed larger numbers along the way to achieving these reforms and redirections
However, even at their peak, the actively engaged people never exceeded 1% of the citizenry, often far less
These builders of democracy and justice came out of the anti-slavery drives
The precious for women's right to vote
The arose from farmers and workers in industrial sectors, demanding regulation of banks, raros, and manufacturers, and fair labor standards
In the 20th century, improvements of life came with tiny third parties and their allies, pushing the major parties in the Electoral Arena adopt such measures as the right to foreign labor unions, the 40-hour week, progressive taxation, the minimum wage, unemployment compensation, and social security
More recently came Medicare and civil rights civil liberties, nuclear arms treaties, consumer, and environmental triumphs
All sparked by citizen advocates and small third parties who never won a national election
If you're willing to lose persistently, your causes can become winners in time
The story of how I came to these civic activities may be instructive for people who go along with Senator Daniel Webster's belief
Justice sir is the great interest of man on earth
I grew up in a small, highly industrialized town in Connecticut with three siblings and parents who owned a popular restaurant bakery and delicate dozen
Two waterways, the Mad River and the Still River, crossed alongside our main street
As a child I asked, why couldn't we wait and fish in them? Like the rivers we read about in our school books
The answer, the factories freely use these rivers to dump harmful toxic chemicals and other pollutants
In fact, the companies took control of rivers that belonged to all of us for their own profitable pursuits
Later, I realized the rivers were not part of our normal lives at all, except when they flooded our streets
There were no water pollution regulations to speak of them
I realized only strong laws could clean up our waterways
My useful observation of our town's two river sewers started a straight line to my eighth grade graduation speech about the great conservation as National Park Advocate John Muir
Then to my studies at Princeton on the origins of public sanitation and then to Rachel Carson's silent spring
These engagements prepared me for the seizing the golden hour of environmental lawmaking in the early 1970s
I played a leading citizen role in lobbying through Congress the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Laws, EPA, workplace safety standards, OSHA and the safe drinking water rack
If there's less lead in your body, no more asbestos in your lungs and cleaner air and water
It's because of those laws over the years
Today, enforcement of these life-saving laws under Trump is being dismantled wholesale
Rolling back these perils is the immediate challenge to a resurgent environmental movement with young generation
As for consumer advocates, there are no permanent victories
Passing a laws only the first step, the next step, And the next step is defending the law
For me, some of these battles were highly personal
I lost friends in high school and college to highway collisions
The first leading cause of death in that age group
Then the blame was put on the driver, derisively called, then not behind the wheel
Two drunk drivers had responsibility
But safer designed vehicles and highways could prevent crashes and diminish their severity
when they occurred, there were no seatbelts, padded dash panels, no airbags, or other crash were the protections to diminish the severity of collisions
The brakes, tires, and handling stability of US vehicles left much to be desired, even comparison with foreign manufacturers
I like to hitchhike, including back and forth from Princeton and Harvard Law School
Sometimes the driver and I came upon ghastly, crash scenes
The horrors made a deep impression on me
They sparked my writing a paper at Law School on unsafe automotive design and the need for motor vehicle safety laws
One of my closest friends at Law School, Fred Condon, was driving home one day from work to his young family in New Hampshire
And momentarily, drives behind the wheel of his station wagon
The vehicle went to the shoulder of the road and tipped over
There were no seat belts in 1961
Fred became a paraplegic
Such preventable violence, created fire and my ability
The auto industry was cruelly refusing to install long-known life-saving safety features and pollution controls
Instead, the industry focused on advertising the annual style changes and excessive horsepower
I was outraged
The more I investigated the suppression of auto-safety devices, publicized evidence from court cases about the auto companies negligently harming vehicle occupants, especially the instability of a GM vehicle called the Corverer
The more general motors was keen on discrediting my writings in testimony
hired private detectives to follow me in order to get dirt
After the publication of my book on safe and easy speed, GM wanted to undermine my forthcoming testimony before Senate Subcommittee in 1966, the Capitol Police caught them
The media was all over the struggle and congress between me and giant general motors
With remarkable speed compared to today, in 1966, Congress and President Johnson brought the largest industry in America under federal regulation for safety, pollution control, and fuel efficiency
By the year 2015, three and a half million deaths were averted, just in the U
S
Minions more injuries prevented, billions of dollars saved
What did it take for a victory against such overwhelming odds? Well, there were one few advocates who knew how to communicate the evidence everywhere

The result in September 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed the safety legislation in the White House with me by a side receiving a pen
Between 1966 and 1976, those six critically connected factors were used over and over
It became the golden age of legislation and regulatory action for consumer worker and environmental protection
Those connected elements of our past campaigns need to be kept in mind by people striving to do the same today
For drinking water, safety, antibiotic resistance deaths, criminal justice reform, risk from climate disruption, bio and nanotech impacts, the nuclear arms race, peace treaties, dangerous to children, chemical and radioactive perils, and the like
According to a solid study in 2016, by Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, preventable hospital deaths, take a mind-boggling 5,000 lives a week in America
The 1980s climaxed, our dramatic struggle to limit smoking in public places, Regulated tobacco industry and established conditions for reducing smoking
Their struggle began in earnest in 1964 with the U
S
Surgeon General's famous report linking cigarette smoking to cancer and other diseases
Over 400,000 deaths a year in the United States are related to smoking
Public hearings, litigation, media exposays, and industry whistleblowers, joined with crucial medical scientists to take on a very powerful industry
I asked Michael Perchuk a leading Senate staffer, how many full-time advocates were working on tobacco industry control at that time? Mr
Perchuk estimated no more than 1,000 full-time champions in the US, pressing for a smoke-free society
I say that's a remarkably small number of people making it happen
They had a public opinion majority of arouse people, non-smokers, behind them
Many smokers were quitting the nicotine addiction, just think
From 45% of adults down to 15% by 2018
The tipping point was when Congress passed legislation empowering the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the tobacco companies
Keep in mind that advances for consumers and workers are usually followed by a variety of corporate counter attacks when the further behind such reform phase
Then, legislate, cheers, and regulatory agencies become very vulnerable to industry capture
The stalls existing are further enforcement
What's that saying? Justice requires constant vigilance
We see the difference between the driven stamina of counter-attacking, profit-driven corporate power and the fatigue that overcomes a voluntary citizenry whose awareness and skill need renewal
It is not a fair contest between large companies like General Motors, Pfizer, Exxon Mobile, Wells Fargo, Monsanto, plus other very wealthy companies and lobbyists compared to people protection groups was very limited resources
Moreover, the corporations have the communities and privileges unavailable to real human beings
For example, Takata was guilty of a horrific airbag scandal, but to company escaped criminal prosecution
Instead, Takata was allowed to go bankrupt and its executives kept nice nest eggs
But organized people need not be awed by corporate power
Lawmakers still want vote votes more than they need, campaign finance from corporations
We fire outnumber corporations in potential influence, but voters must be connected clearly to what organized voters want from the lawmakers, delegated the constitutional authority of we, the people, We want them to do the people's work
A people's Congress, the most constitutionally powerful branch of government, can override black or reach channel the most destructive corporations
They're only 100 senators and 435 representatives, with just 2 million organized activists back home
A Congress watchdog hobby
Congressional justice can be made reliable and prompt
We've proved that again and again with far fewer people
But today Congress marinated in campaign money has been advocating its responsibilities to an executive branch, which too often has become a corporate state controlled by big companies
President Franklin D
Roosevelt in 1938 in a message to Congress called concentrated corporate power over our government, quote, fascism and quote
A modest engagement of 1% of adults in each of the 435 congressional districts
Some of these centers and representatives or state legislators to their own town meetings, where the citizen represents their agenda
Backed by a majority of voters can turn Congress around
Our representatives can become a fountainhead of democracy and justice, elevating human possibilities
I dream of our schools or after school clinics teaching community civic action skills leading to the good life
Adult education classes should do the same
We need to create citizen training and action libraries
Students and adults love knowledge that relate to their daily life
Large majorities of Americans regard us a political labels, favor a living wage, universal health insurance, real enforcement against corporate crime fraud and abuse
They want to fare productive tax system, public budgets, returning value to the people back home and modern infrastructure, and in end to most corporate subsidies, increasingly they're demanding serious attention to climate disruption and other environmental and global health perils and pandemics
Big majority of people want efficient government and end to endless aggressive wars that boomerang
They want clean elections and fair rules for voters and candidates
These are changes that bring people together
Changes Congress can make happen
People around the world
Favorite democracy because it brings the best out of its inhabitants and its leaders
But this objective requires citizens to want to spend time on this great opportunity called democracy between and add elections
History gives examples that encourage us to believe that breaking through powers easier and we think
People say to me, I don't know what to do
Start to learn by doing
The more they practice citizen action, the more skilled and innovative they become at it
Like learning a trade, a profession, a hobby, learning how to swim
They're doubts for each judgements and hesitancy
Begin to melt away in the crucible of action
Their arguments for change become deeper and sharper
In 1965 to 1966, when I was making the case for safer automobiles, I realized that there are a lot of industries making a lot of money from dealing with the horrific results of crashes
Medical care and insurance sales, repairing cars
There is a perverse incentive to do nothing but maintain the status quo
By contrast, preventing these tragedies, freeze consumer dollars to spend or save and volunteer roads for better livelihoods
What it takes is a small number of people to exert their civic muscle, both as individuals and organized groups on our legal decision makers
Ideally, it only takes a few enlightened rich people contributing funds to accelerate citizen efforts against the commanders of greed and power Why in our past rich people donated essential money for the Annie slavery, women's right to vote, and civil rights movements? We should remember that
With the onset of climate catastrophe, every one of us needs to have a higher estimate of our own significance, of our own sustained dedication to the civic life, or part of a normal way of daily living, along with our personal family life
Showing up thoughtfully is half a democracy
That's what advances life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
Remember, our country's full of problems we don't deserve and solutions which we do not apply
That gap is a democracy gap that no power can stop us from closing
We owe this to our posterity
Don't we want our descendants instead of cursing us for our short-sighted neglect? Don't we want them to bless our foresight and bright horizons, which can fulfill their lives peacefully and advance the common good
Thank you
If you go to the store in search of milk, there are a dizzying number of products to choose from
There's dairy milk but also plant-based products
To turn a plant into something resembling milk, it must be either soaked, drained, rinsed, and milled into a thick paste, or dried and milled into flour
The plant-paste or flower is then fortified with vitamins and minerals, flavored and diluted with water
The result is a barrage of options that share many of the qualities of animal milk, so which milk is actually best for you
Let's dive in to some of the most popular milk's, dairy, almond, soy, or oat
A 250-millimeter glass of cow's milk contains 8 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, and 2 to 8 grams of fat, depending on if it's skin, reduced fat, or whole
That's approximately 15% the daily protein and average adult needs, roughly 10% the carbohydrates, and 2 to 15% the fat
Most plant-based milks have less carbohydrates than dairy milk
They also have less fat, but more of what's often called good fats
Meanwhile, the healthy nutrients vitamin D and calcium found in dairy milk don't occur naturally in most plant-based milks
Looking more closely at our plant-based milks, both almond and oat are low in protein compared to dairy
But while almond milk has the least nutrients of the four, oat milk is full of beta-glucans, a healthy type of fiber
It also has a lot of carbohydrates compared to other plant milks, sometimes as much as dairy milk
Soy milk, meanwhile, has as much protein as cow's milk, and is also a great source of potassium
Soy beans contain isoflavin, which people used to think might trigger hormonal imbalances by mimicking the function of estrogen, But ultimately, soy milk contains very small amounts of isophlavones, which have a much weaker effect on our bodies than estrogen
Depending on individual circumstances, one of these milks may be the clear winner
If you're lactose intolerant, then the plant-based milks pull ahead
Wow, if you're allergic to nuts, almond milk is out
For people who don't have access to a wide and varied diet, dairy milk can be the most efficient way to get these nutrients
But all else being equal, any one of these four milks is nutritious enough to be part of a balanced diet
That's why for many people, the milk that's best for you is actually the milk that's best for the planet
So which uses the fewest resources and produces the least pollution? It takes almost four square kilometers to produce just one glass of cow's milk, land use that drives deforestation and habitat destruction
Most of that is land the cows live on, and some is used to grow their feed
Many cows eat soybeans and oats
It takes much less land to grow the oats or soybeans for milk than it does to feed a dairy cow
Only about a quarter square kilometer per glass
All-ment milk has similar land use, but where that land is also matters
Soybean farms are a major driver of deforestation, while oat and almond farms aren't
Making milk uses water every step of the way, but it's the farming stage where big differences emerge
Dairy milk uses the most water, about 120 liters per glass, mostly to water cows and grow their food
Almond takes second place, at more than 70 liters of water per glass
Most of that water is used to grow almond trees, which take years of watering before they start producing almonds
The trees must be watered consistently or they die, while many other crops can be left phallow and still produce later
All told, soy and oats require less water to grow, only about 5 to 10 liters per glass of milk
Milk production generates some greenhouse gas emissions, about 0
1 to 0
2 kilograms per glass for the plant-based milk
But for dairy milk, the cows themselves also produce emissions by burping and farting out large quantities of the gas methane
Overall, each glass of dairy milk contributes over half a kilogram of greenhouse gas emissions
So while depending on your dietary needs, any one of these milks may be a good fit
In terms of the health of our planet, There's a strong case for choosing plant-based milks, particularly oat or soy milk
So we said Apple is on target to become carbon neutral across its entire business and manufacturing supply chain by 2030
Can you explain exactly what that means? Sure
So today Apple is carbon neutral for all of our own operations
and we're running on 100% renewable energy for our corporate campuses, for our stores, and for our data centers
So we know how to do this work
The challenge for 2030 is to convert our supply chain and that work has already begun
We already have 70 suppliers over eight gigabytes of energy coming online in our supply chain
And then our last piece will be to convert the energy that our customers use to charge our devices to clean energy
What are some of the biggest changes that Apple's going to need to make in its business operations in order to be able to achieve those goals? So imagine if instead of mining material to go into Apple products, we actually started with recycled material
So we're not going all the way back to the mind through smelting, transportation, processing
Instead, we're really talking about reprocessing, to some degree and putting that material right back into product
Super important with things like conflict, metals or rare earths
So Apple has been doing that work now for several years
We've actually promised that we want to make all of our products out of recycled and renewable materials
And so that investment also means we get to take away all the carbon emissions associated with everything up until the point of the recycled material
So it strikes me that you actually hold a really interesting perspective
You're now at Apple and deep in the business world around these things
But formally, you actually led the US Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama administration
So you've seen the government side as well
What in your mind is the right way to look at the respective roles of the state and the market in fighting the climate crisis? I don't think there's anything that business can do that replaces the role of government and leadership
Yes, I ran the EPA, but the other part of my history is I worked there almost 20 years before I became the head of the EPA
And you see firsthand that only government is really charged with protecting its citizens
We always think protection, we think the military
But I think the protection of the environmental protection agency or the air quality board in California or a local health department is as important to the day-to-day life of the people in that jurisdiction as anything that the other security type protection can provide
Now business is a different story
I think business has an incredibly important role to play in leading, especially at this time
Apple said it's goal is 2030, carbon neutral
Obviously the UN is saying 2050 carbon neutral
We decided to challenge ourselves to go as fast as we could possibly do it so that other businesses wouldn't have an excuse to say I need longer
I need much, much longer
I think it's great to see this moment where suddenly there seems to be a realization that climate change policy cannot be boistered on others
that in fact it has to be organic, you know, for lack of a better word
And it's not an either or it's always been this weird belief that we're taught from little that you can either be successful or you can do the right thing
There's no difference between the two
There's it's a false choice
Although a lot of us have been talking about justice for some time, it is only recently that I think this idea of justice as a relates to the environment and climate is making it a appearance in a form such as this
You've personally described systemic racism and climate change as interconnected issues, and I think they'd be great to hear more
To me, they're just the same thing
There is no climate justice without real justice
There's no climate change remedy that is going to be made and stick that doesn't involve justice
And sometimes more and more, I'm starting to think that we shouldn't attack climate change
We should attack justice and injustice
and if we did climate change, we would take care of itself
For me, it's always come down to restoring people to the center of the discussion of solutions and restoring representation for the community's most impacted by climate change at the table of solution making
Well, thank you
I appreciate it
It's been a real pleasure to speak with you today
And I look forward to seeing how you advance the efforts you talked about
And thank you for the voice you've been
I think it's super important that leadership look like us, but also sound like you
So thank you
So, David, just a few months, you transition into a new role as CEO of Consumer Retail at Amazon
That's a big role
How will climate sit as a priority for you, given all the other things you'll have on your plate? We've spent much of our end of the summer in smoke-filled Seattle, unable to enjoy the majestic Pacific Northwest due to all the fires that encompass the west coast of the U
S
the summer
Climate is a very real challenge for all of us not just at Amazon but in our daily lives at this point
And I've been focused on this with the team and with Kara for years now
In fact, we've embedded the sustainability teams inside of our operations teams as opposed to being a separate part of the company
because we wanted those teams connected with the groups that can actually make change
Karra, can you describe a couple of the biggest hurdles you face as you work to reduce the carbon footprint of a company like Amazon? One of the really exciting but also complex things about Amazon is the diversity of businesses that were in
The range of services and products of industries and different types of buildings and stores and fulfillment centers and of course all of our online infrastructure business as well
And we're committed to reaching net zero emissions
I think our size and our scale can actually be a tremendous advantage
It forces us to think about our carbon footprint throughout all of our businesses, our operations, our technologies, our services, our products
And at one end, we want to power our operations by 100% renewable energy by 2025
But we're also making sure that when you receive a shipment, we're net zero carbon all the way through operations and we want to do this in a very Amazonian way
So we took a number of years to build what we call a carbon system of record
These are tools that allow us to think about this holistically across the company
Dave Amazon has made a pledge
You call it the climate pledge to be net zero across your business by 2040
That's 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement
Give us a sense of the scale of transformation that that calls for across your operations
Yeah, it's very daunting
When we started this process, we started from position of science, of digging in and understanding all the inputs of our business, what parts of our business create and put carbon into the environment, what are the elements each piece of that process and how do we improve them? As we started looking at that, we said, well, how are we going to meet these objectives? And it really requires innovation across almost every aspect of the business, whether it be in our renewable space, whether it be an electrification of our vehicles, whether it be in our packaging and processes, whether it be working with manufacturers
Essentially, the entire span of our supply chain is required to modify to meet the objectives of this over time, which is why the climate pledge was so important
Kara, the climate pledge is not just about Amazon, you're inviting other companies to join you
We know with the climate pledge, we cannot do this alone
It's going to take companies, but partnership also with governments and communities and individuals who will come up with solutions and new technologies
We want to engage our full supply chain as well as other companies and we're really excited that already 11 major organizations have signed on to the Climate Pledge with us
We want to accelerate innovation and we've established a $2 billion Climate Pledge fund to invest in these companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low carbon economy
So we know this is a very ambitious challenge, but we want to make the greatest impact in the shortest possible timeline
And it's exciting to share the complexity about how we think about this at Amazon with other companies and invite them to come along with us
Dave, when a company like Amazon moves, it can have a huge impact across supply chains
Give us an example or two of how a decision that you've made is catalyzing innovation across the sector
I can tell you just the example of Rivian
Rivian is the electric vehicle manufacturer that is going to build 100,000 electric delivery vehicles for our delivery fleet
When we went out and made this investment, the number of new companies that started to spawn relative to supporting Rivian to new electric delivery vehicles to even alternative fuels
We start to get calls about alternative jet fuel
The day we put out that announcement on Rivian
So as soon as people saw that we were going to invest real capital for substantive portions of our operations, this is not hobbies, but putting real money into big pieces of our operation, it was amazed at the amount of companies that started coming out and who had an emergent technology here or had a great idea and needed help in getting manufacturing started, they were just an example after example of those
Dave Kara, thank you so much for being with us
We wish you every success with the climate pledge and really can't wait to see the progress you guys are going to make
And thank you
It's an honor to be here to be part of such an amazing event
Thank you
I used to be really bad at earning money
Early on, I was a junior financial planner, and my job was to help people manage their wealth
But my salary was solo that I started writing my bike tour to save money on gas, and I started a garden to save money on food
Now I run a bookkeeping agency that specifically serves creative businesses
This might sound strange coming from a former financial planner, but I'm not a fan of capitalism
Almost everyone I work with and know and love is an artist, including me
So I know the way the system is set up, freelancers and artists are too often way underpaid
They often feel like focusing on money will corrupt their creativity or they think they're just not that good at making money anyway
But the truth is, we can be good at it
And in fact, we have to be because our freedom is at stake
are freedom to create, to influence, and to use the power of money to change the very exploitation that keeps artists broke to begin with
I'm not struggling anymore, and I've learned a lot since being a financial planner, and I just wanted to share that knowledge
So here's what I've learned and done
One, what you do
When it comes to your offering, you have to be able to answer the following question
Why would anyone hire you over your competition? If you can't answer that question, neither can your potential clients, which means you can't It charge more for the thing that makes your work special
Price becomes a differentiator and bidding becomes a race to the bottom
What sets you apart to be what you do, why you do it, or how you do it? A string quartet that arranges in place hip-hop medallies
Or a branding firm that has a unique way of marketing technology to baby boomers
Or a prop and set designer who's known for crafting beautiful paper-machay miniatures
Two, pull you to it for
After you determine what sets you apart, position yourself your ideal customer
In order for this to be effective, you must narrow your focus
Without focus, you try to be everything for everyone and you want to be nothing for nobody
Then use the kind of language that appeals to your target customer
Create the kind of marketing materials or the kind of portfolio that attracts them
Then be in the real life and virtual places they are
For example, if you're a videographer and you want to work with mission driven companies that bring clean water to post-spoiled scarce, create a video trailer that shows exactly how the power of film moves people to act
Three, when it's time to talk money, understand the real value that you create
You're not just being compensated for the time that you work on a project
You're being compensated for everything you've learned and everything you've done over the years that make you excellent at what you do
Ask yourself questions like, how does your service impact a customer's bottom line? How do you create efficiencies that generate cost savings? How much money can your customer make from a product that you help them create
For example, if you're a freelancer that helps YouTube creators develop merch like T-shirts and dad hats, mention how much money you've helped your clients generate
Or if you've created a diversity and inclusion training program for corporations, talk about how much time and money a company saves purchasing your product instead of developing their own
For, make sure your price includes your taxes, your overhead, and your profit
When you're a freelancer, you are your own business
So you're responsible for marketing, accounting, taxes, legal insurance, overhead, and profit
If you price too low, you've already negotiated against yourself
And if a potential customer balks at your pricing, don't apologize
Just say that you're running a business and you can't afford to do the work for less
Instead of corrupting your creativity, focusing on making more money could actually enhance it by giving you the freedom of choice, because when you earn enough working with clients that value your work, you don't have to compromise by working with clients who don't
We are all here today because the climate count on has begun
And we are nowhere near where we need to be
Science tells us we must leave it global heating to 1
5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels
We are on track for 3 degrees at least
Billions of people around the world are already suffering from all failure to act
its disruption due to our outdated addiction to fusing fools is causing unprecedented wildfires, more intense and frequent cyclones, floods, droughts and other weather extremes
Toxic air pollution is choking our major cities and harming our health and biodiversity on land and seas and the growing pressure
No country is immune from the climate crisis
But in every country, it is the poorest and most vulnerable were hardest hit, despite having done lists to cause the problem
Over the past 25 years, the richest 10% of the global population has been responsible for more than half of all carbon emissions
And the poorest 50% were responsible for just 7% of emissions
Ranking justice and inequality of this scale is a cancer
If we don't act now, this century may be one of humanity's lust
The COVID-19 pandemic has led bear the fundamental injustice is an inequality of our societies
That people of this pandemic presents an opportunity to chart a new course when that can address every aspect of the climate crisis aton
History shows that when we grab such moments, we can succeed
can build a safer, fair, more resilient world, but we need to move quickly
That is why I'm urging governments to take six climate positive actions to recover better together
Invest in green jobs do not bail out polluting industries especially coal and fossil-full subsidies and put a price on carbon, they climate risk into account in all financial and policy decisions, work together in solidarity and most important, live no one behind
This is the course of action that thousands of companies, cities, states, regions, universities, and investors are already choosing by committing to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest
They are moving to protect people and our planet
Momentum is building
Cities and regions with a carbon footprint greater than the United States, and companies with revenues of more than $11
4 trillion US dollars have now committed to net zero emissions by 2050
That's double the number from when this initiative was launched at the Climate Action Summit in 2019
Likewise, investors managing over $4 trillion US dollars have joined the race to zero
This number has also more than double since the initiative was first launched at the same summit
But it is still necessary for governments to create the tax and regulatory frameworks that will further stimulate climate action by the private sector
The European Union has announced plans to cut its emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050
And China, as recently announced its intention to become carbon neutral before 2060
I now count on these and other main emitter to present before COP26 concrete plans and policies that will bring the world to carbon neutrality by 2050
We must make sure that each country, each city, company, bank and international organization has a transition plan to reach zero net emissions
We also need to see much greater efforts to build resilience in vulnerable countries, which There is no list to cause climate change but bear the worth impacts
In the big coastal delters, the highlands of the Pacific and the Caribbean, and drylands such as the Africa-Saial region, we must help people adapt to climate impacts as they recover from COVID-19
I call on developed countries to meet their commitment to mobilize $100 billion dollars a year for mitigation, adaptation, and resilience in developing countries
We must work to create the conditions needed for a massive mobilization of funds also from financially institutions and private investors
We must keep building climate ambition
On the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement in December, leaders from government, business and civil society will gather online to do just that
We need to kick start the race to the Glasgow Climate Conference in 2021
To those we have already joined the race, I applaud you
But they also ask you to do mar and much faster
You have raised your ambition and your commitment
We need you now to also raise your voices and push government to do better, especially those we meet the most
To those yet to join, my message is simple
We can only win the race to zero together, so I urge you all to get on board
The countdown is begun
What you're hearing is the sound of a native forest in southern Europe
The calm, tranquil feeling we all get is not a coincidence
We all evolved in ecosystems like this, where the sounds of birds and insects indicated the possibility of food, medicines, and all the resources we need for survival
ecosystems and their biodiversity still hold the key to life on this planet
I'm obsessed with this biodiversity
The magic of the infinite network where every species depends on others to survive
For most of my career, I focused on just one of those fascinating connections between insects and fungi in the soil
I longed to understand the scale of these networks and to understand how they might help with one of the greatest challenges facing humanity
I'll rapidly warming planet
The problem is clear, we know we need to reduce our emissions and draw the existing carbon out of the atmosphere
Stop the damage and start the repair
And this is where forests can help
Like old plants, trees capture carbon from the atmosphere, and they use it for growth, and some of that carbon into the soil where it can stay for hundreds or even thousands of years
If we could stop the losses of forest around the world, we could directly help to cut our annual emissions
And if we could start to tip the balance in the other direction, we might even help the repair process
But if people were really going to invest their valuable time and energy in a solution like this, we needed to comprehend the size of this opportunity and understand the impacts that we can have as individuals
But comprehending something of this scale was a completely new challenge for me in my colleagues
But this, we needed the knowledge of experts all over the world
So we began building a new network
The more people we contacted, the more data we received, and the more clearly patterns began to emerge
With data from over 1
2 million forests, we were able to build new machine learning models to predict forest structure around the world
For the first time, we could see that our Earth is home to just over 3 trillion trees
the most half of what existed before human civilization
We could see where the different species are distributed and how carbon is stored in this massive system
But this approach could also show us something more transformative
Using the same models, we could begin to see where trees might naturally grow under the existing climate
And this suggested that outside of urban and agricultural areas, there's 0
9 billion hectares where trees would naturally exist
And this is room for just over one trillion new trees
We estimated that if we could protect these areas in the long term, then the soils and vegetation might capture up to 30% of the excess carbon in the atmosphere, capturing decades of human emissions
We now have a wealth of ongoing research to refine these initial estimates, but the scale of this potential suggests that, along with all the other benefits these ecosystems provide, might also represent a valuable role in our fight against climate change
When our research was accepted to be published in the journal science, nothing could have prepared us for the media explosion that followed
Suddenly, it seemed like the whole world was talking about the potential of trees
Under the umbrella of the UN decade on ecosystem restoration, the world economic forum launched their trillion trees campaign
To go alongside similar efforts from the WWF and United Nations, suddenly governments and companies all around the world were pledging their commitment to the restoration of Earth's forests, and with the job creation that would result, the idea of a global restoration movement was becoming a reality
But in the excitement of it all, and with the chance to make that positive impact I'd always dreamed of, I made some naive and stupid mistakes in communication that threatened the entire message
The simplicity of our message was its strength, but it came at the expense of nuance that is so important, and as the headlines began to emerge, I desperately just wanted to pull them back in
Because to some, it seemed like we were proposing restoration as the single solution to climate change, and this is the opposite of what this movement needs
When viewed through this lens, restoration just seems like an easy way out
A chance for us to offset our emissions by planting a few trees and ignore the very real and urgent challenges of cutting emissions and protecting the ecosystems that we currently have
Restoration is not a silver bullet
There is no silver bullet
It is just one of a huge portfolio of solutions that we so desperately need
And this view of trees as an easy way out is such a tempting perspective, but it is a real threat to the climate change movement and to the ecosystems that still remain
This is also the sound of trees
It's a eucalyptus plantation that exists just a couple of miles away from where we began
Notice how there were no sounds of birds or insects
The songs of biodiversity are gone
That's because what you're hearing is not an ecosystem
It's a monoculture of one single tree species planted for rapid tree growth
Along with the biodiversity that you still live here, this local community has now lost the benefits those ecosystems provided, like clean water, soil fertility, and most urgently, protection from the intense fires that now threaten the region every summer
The UN suggests that almost half of reforous today is around the world, our monoculture is just like this, planted for rapid timber production or carbon capture
Just like a farm, these plantations may be valuable for timber, but they are not the restoration of nature
And monocultures are just one of the many ways we can damage ecosystems, when we offset our emissions without considering the local ecology or the people that depend on it
During these mistakes a second wave of articles flooded in, warning of the risks of restoration don't wrong
And this criticism was so painful, because it was entirely correct
But most of all I was terrified that we would squander this incredible opportunity, because restoration has such enormous potential for positive impact
But just like every good idea, it only works if we get it right
But as the dust settled, we realised that this was actually a time when the entire movement gained real momentum
More people than ever were interested in global restoration
And with messages flooding in about the successes and failures of restoration projects around the world, we had access to the lessons that can help us to get it right
Every new criticism offered incredible opportunities to learn and grow
Every failed restoration example was a lesson on how to improve future projects
And learnings were an entirely new source of data, data from the real heroes of this movement, from the people on the ground who were conserving and managing ecosystems around the world
No one knows their ecosystems more, and no one is more aware of the risks of restoration done wrong, and the need for accurate ecological information to show the best areas to focus on, which species can exist in those regions, and what benefits those species can provide to the community
Historically, these are questions that have been addressed through years of rigorous trial and error
But we started wondering, what if we fed this deep, on-the-ground knowledge back into our machine learning models to learn from the thousands of successes and failures? Could this help us to identify which strategies are working and failing around the world? And about a year ago, we started working with Google, to help build and scale this idea into a functioning online ecosystem where projects from around the world can learn and grow together
By pairing Google's technology and our models, this ever-growing network of scientists, restoration projects and NGOs could now build the platform that could serve the restoration movement
And I am so excited to give you a first glimpse of what we've been working on
This is restore an open data platform for the restoration movement
Providing free ecological insights to show which species of trees, grasses or shrubs might existing that region, monitoring of projects so that we can all see the developments happening on the ground
And most importantly, for the sharing of ecological information, so that restoration organizations can learn from one another, and so that funders can find and track projects to support
Restore is a digital ecosystem for restoration
The more data the community upload, the stronger the predictions get, and the more informed action we can all take
Putting the learnings of thousands of projects into the hands of people everywhere
And this ecosystem is much bigger than just planting trees
Trees are just the symbol for entire ecosystem restoration
Restore is for the protection of land so trees can recover for the amendment of soil so vegetation can return
And for the thousands of other approaches used to promote the health of grasslands, Patelons and all other ecosystems that are equally important for life on Earth
Whether you want to support a wetland conservation project with huge carbon potential, or simply find which species of plant might exist in your garden, and how much soil carbon they could accumulate, with this tool we hope that everyone everywhere will have a chance to engage in the restoration movement
The word restore is defined as the act of returning something back to its original state, But it's also the act of returning it back to its original owners
The restoration of nature is for the local biodiversity and the communities that depend on it
And as that network grows, the collective action benefits everyone
And these benefits go far beyond the threat of climate change
Even if climate change stopped right now, the protection and rebuilding of Earth's biodiversity would still be a top priority because it underpins all life on Earth
It can help us with all other global threats, including extreme weather events, droughts, food shortages, and global pandemics
But global restoration won't be easy, and it will not be solved by tech solutions alone
These tools can inform us, but ultimately, the challenge is one that can only be addressed by us, by all of us
Just like the interdependent species that make up natural ecosystems, we humans are deeply dependent on one another
We need the immense network of limitless connections, the farmers and project leaders on the ground who need local markets and industries to make use of sustainable products
The scientists, governments, NGOs, businesses, you, me, we are all needed to keep this movement going
We need the whole ecology of humanity
Thank you
HISTORY'S FIRST Empire rose out of a hot, dry landscape without rainfall to nourish crops without trees or stones for building
In spite of all this, its inhabitants built the world's first cities with monumental architecture and large populations and they built them entirely out of mud
Sumer occupied the southern part of modern Iraq in the region called Mesopotamia
Mesopotamia means between two rivers, the Tigris and the Ufretis
Around 5,000 BCE, early Sumerians use irrigation channels, dams and reservoirs to redirect river water and farm large areas of previously bone dry land
Agricultural communities like this were slowly springing up around the world, but some are with the first to take the next step
Using clay bricks made from river mud, they began to build multi-storyed homes and temples
They invented the wheel, a potter's wheel, returning mud into household goods and tools
Those clay bricks gave rise to the world's first cities, probably around 4,500 BCE, at the top of the city's social ladder, or priests and priestesses, who were considered nobility, then merchants, craftspeople, farmers, and enslaved people
The Samarion Empire consisted of distinct city states that operated like small nations
They were loosely linked by language and spiritual belief, but lacked centralized control
The earliest cities were Orr, Orr, and Eradue
And eventually there were a dozen cities
Each had a king who served a role somewhere between a priest and a ruler
Sometimes they fought against each other to conquer new territories
Each city was dedicated to a patron deity, considered the city's founder
The largest and most important building in the city was this patron god's home, the Ziggurat, a temple designed as a stepped pyramid
Around 3,200 BCE, Sumerians began to expand their reach
The potters will found a new home on chariots and wagons
They built boats out of reads and date palm leaves with linen sails that carried them vast distances by river and sea
To supplement scarce resources, they built a trade network with rising kingdoms in Egypt, Anatolia and Ethiopia, importing gold, silver, lapis lazuli and Cedarwood
Trade was the unlikely impetus for the invention of the world's first writing system
It started as a system of accounting for Sumerian merchants conducting business with traders abroad
After a few hundred years, the early pictogram system called CUNIFORM turned into a script
The Samarians drafted up the first written laws and created the first school system, designed to teach the craft of writing, and pioneered some less exciting innovations, like bureaucracy and taxes
In the schools, scribes studying from dawn to dusk, from childhood well into adulthood
adulthood
They learned accounting, mathematics, and copied works of literature
Hims, myths, proverbs, animal fables, magic spells, and the first epics on clay tablets
Some of those tablets told the story of Gilgamesh, a king of the city of Uruk, who was also the subject of mythical tales
But by the third millennium BCE, Sumer was no longer the only empire around, or even in Mesopotamia, waves of nomadic tribes poured into the region from the north and east
Some newcomers looked up to the Samarians, adopting their way of life, and using the CUNiform script to express their own languages
In 2300 BCE, the Akkadian King Sargan conquered the Samarian city states, but Sargan respected Samarian culture and Akkadians and Sumerians existed side by side for centuries
Other invading groups focused only on looting and destruction, even as Sumerian culture spread, a steady onslaught of invasions killed off the Sumerian people by 1750 BCE
Afterward, Sumer disappeared back into the desert dirt not to be rediscovered until the 19th century
Samarion culture lived on for thousands of years
First through the Acadians, then the Assyrians, then the Babylonians
The Babylonians passed Samarion inventions and traditions through, along Hebrew, Greek, and Roman cultures
Some persist today
