Over the decades, my colleagues and I have exposed terrible misdeeds and crimes by large corporations, which have taken many lives and caused injuries and diseases
On top of damaging economic costs, affecting many incidents
But exposure was not enough
We had to secure a congressional mandate to prevent such devastation
As a result, many lies were saved and many traumas prevented in, especially in the areas of automobile, pharmaceutical and environmental, and workplace health and safety
Along the way, we kept getting one question again and again
Ralph, how do you do all this? Your groups are small, your funds are modest, and you don't make campaign contributions to politicians
My response points to an overlooked, amazing pattern of American history
Just about every advance in justice, every blessing of democracy came from the efforts of small numbers of individual citizens
They knew what they were talking about
They expanded public opinion, or whatever I'm Lincoln called, the All-Important Public sentiment
The few citizens who started these movements and listed larger numbers along the way to achieving these reforms and redirections
However, even at their peak, the actively engaged people never exceeded 1% of the citizenry, often far less
These builders of democracy and justice came out of the anti-slavery drives
The precious for women's right to vote
The arose from farmers and workers in industrial sectors, demanding regulation of banks, raros, and manufacturers, and fair labor standards
In the 20th century, improvements of life came with tiny third parties and their allies, pushing the major parties in the Electoral Arena adopt such measures as the right to foreign labor unions, the 40-hour week, progressive taxation, the minimum wage, unemployment compensation, and social security
More recently came Medicare and civil rights civil liberties, nuclear arms treaties, consumer, and environmental triumphs
All sparked by citizen advocates and small third parties who never won a national election
If you're willing to lose persistently, your causes can become winners in time
The story of how I came to these civic activities may be instructive for people who go along with Senator Daniel Webster's belief
Justice sir is the great interest of man on earth
I grew up in a small, highly industrialized town in Connecticut with three siblings and parents who owned a popular restaurant bakery and delicate dozen
Two waterways, the Mad River and the Still River, crossed alongside our main street
As a child I asked, why couldn't we wait and fish in them? Like the rivers we read about in our school books
The answer, the factories freely use these rivers to dump harmful toxic chemicals and other pollutants
In fact, the companies took control of rivers that belonged to all of us for their own profitable pursuits
Later, I realized the rivers were not part of our normal lives at all, except when they flooded our streets
There were no water pollution regulations to speak of them
I realized only strong laws could clean up our waterways
My useful observation of our town's two river sewers started a straight line to my eighth grade graduation speech about the great conservation as National Park Advocate John Muir
Then to my studies at Princeton on the origins of public sanitation and then to Rachel Carson's silent spring
These engagements prepared me for the seizing the golden hour of environmental lawmaking in the early 1970s
I played a leading citizen role in lobbying through Congress the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Laws, EPA, workplace safety standards, OSHA and the safe drinking water rack
If there's less lead in your body, no more asbestos in your lungs and cleaner air and water
It's because of those laws over the years
Today, enforcement of these life-saving laws under Trump is being dismantled wholesale
Rolling back these perils is the immediate challenge to a resurgent environmental movement with young generation
As for consumer advocates, there are no permanent victories
Passing a laws only the first step, the next step, And the next step is defending the law
For me, some of these battles were highly personal
I lost friends in high school and college to highway collisions
The first leading cause of death in that age group
Then the blame was put on the driver, derisively called, then not behind the wheel
Two drunk drivers had responsibility
But safer designed vehicles and highways could prevent crashes and diminish their severity
when they occurred, there were no seatbelts, padded dash panels, no airbags, or other crash were the protections to diminish the severity of collisions
The brakes, tires, and handling stability of US vehicles left much to be desired, even comparison with foreign manufacturers
I like to hitchhike, including back and forth from Princeton and Harvard Law School
Sometimes the driver and I came upon ghastly, crash scenes
The horrors made a deep impression on me
They sparked my writing a paper at Law School on unsafe automotive design and the need for motor vehicle safety laws
One of my closest friends at Law School, Fred Condon, was driving home one day from work to his young family in New Hampshire
And momentarily, drives behind the wheel of his station wagon
The vehicle went to the shoulder of the road and tipped over
There were no seat belts in 1961
Fred became a paraplegic
Such preventable violence, created fire and my ability
The auto industry was cruelly refusing to install long-known life-saving safety features and pollution controls
Instead, the industry focused on advertising the annual style changes and excessive horsepower
I was outraged
The more I investigated the suppression of auto-safety devices, publicized evidence from court cases about the auto companies negligently harming vehicle occupants, especially the instability of a GM vehicle called the Corverer
The more general motors was keen on discrediting my writings in testimony
hired private detectives to follow me in order to get dirt
After the publication of my book on safe and easy speed, GM wanted to undermine my forthcoming testimony before Senate Subcommittee in 1966, the Capitol Police caught them
The media was all over the struggle and congress between me and giant general motors
With remarkable speed compared to today, in 1966, Congress and President Johnson brought the largest industry in America under federal regulation for safety, pollution control, and fuel efficiency
By the year 2015, three and a half million deaths were averted, just in the U
S
Minions more injuries prevented, billions of dollars saved
What did it take for a victory against such overwhelming odds? Well, there were one few advocates who knew how to communicate the evidence everywhere
Two, several key receptive congressional committee chairs led by three senators
Three, about seven reporters for major newspapers who regularly reported on the unfolding in St

St They wanted their vehicles to be fuel efficient

The result in September 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed the safety legislation in the White House with me by a side receiving a pen
Between 1966 and 1976, those six critically connected factors were used over and over
It became the golden age of legislation and regulatory action for consumer worker and environmental protection
Those connected elements of our past campaigns need to be kept in mind by people striving to do the same today
For drinking water, safety, antibiotic resistance deaths, criminal justice reform, risk from climate disruption, bio and nanotech impacts, the nuclear arms race, peace treaties, dangerous to children, chemical and radioactive perils, and the like
According to a solid study in 2016, by Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, preventable hospital deaths, take a mind-boggling 5,000 lives a week in America
The 1980s climaxed, our dramatic struggle to limit smoking in public places, Regulated tobacco industry and established conditions for reducing smoking
Their struggle began in earnest in 1964 with the U
S
Surgeon General's famous report linking cigarette smoking to cancer and other diseases
Over 400,000 deaths a year in the United States are related to smoking
Public hearings, litigation, media exposays, and industry whistleblowers, joined with crucial medical scientists to take on a very powerful industry
I asked Michael Perchuk a leading Senate staffer, how many full-time advocates were working on tobacco industry control at that time? Mr
Perchuk estimated no more than 1,000 full-time champions in the US, pressing for a smoke-free society
I say that's a remarkably small number of people making it happen
They had a public opinion majority of arouse people, non-smokers, behind them
Many smokers were quitting the nicotine addiction, just think
From 45% of adults down to 15% by 2018
The tipping point was when Congress passed legislation empowering the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the tobacco companies
Keep in mind that advances for consumers and workers are usually followed by a variety of corporate counter attacks when the further behind such reform phase
Then, legislate, cheers, and regulatory agencies become very vulnerable to industry capture
The stalls existing are further enforcement
What's that saying? Justice requires constant vigilance
We see the difference between the driven stamina of counter-attacking, profit-driven corporate power and the fatigue that overcomes a voluntary citizenry whose awareness and skill need renewal
It is not a fair contest between large companies like General Motors, Pfizer, Exxon Mobile, Wells Fargo, Monsanto, plus other very wealthy companies and lobbyists compared to people protection groups was very limited resources
Moreover, the corporations have the communities and privileges unavailable to real human beings
For example, Takata was guilty of a horrific airbag scandal, but to company escaped criminal prosecution
Instead, Takata was allowed to go bankrupt and its executives kept nice nest eggs
But organized people need not be awed by corporate power
Lawmakers still want vote votes more than they need, campaign finance from corporations
We fire outnumber corporations in potential influence, but voters must be connected clearly to what organized voters want from the lawmakers, delegated the constitutional authority of we, the people, We want them to do the people's work
A people's Congress, the most constitutionally powerful branch of government, can override black or reach channel the most destructive corporations
They're only 100 senators and 435 representatives, with just 2 million organized activists back home
A Congress watchdog hobby
Congressional justice can be made reliable and prompt
We've proved that again and again with far fewer people
But today Congress marinated in campaign money has been advocating its responsibilities to an executive branch, which too often has become a corporate state controlled by big companies
President Franklin D
Roosevelt in 1938 in a message to Congress called concentrated corporate power over our government, quote, fascism and quote
A modest engagement of 1% of adults in each of the 435 congressional districts
Some of these centers and representatives or state legislators to their own town meetings, where the citizen represents their agenda
Backed by a majority of voters can turn Congress around
Our representatives can become a fountainhead of democracy and justice, elevating human possibilities
I dream of our schools or after school clinics teaching community civic action skills leading to the good life
Adult education classes should do the same
We need to create citizen training and action libraries
Students and adults love knowledge that relate to their daily life
Large majorities of Americans regard us a political labels, favor a living wage, universal health insurance, real enforcement against corporate crime fraud and abuse
They want to fare productive tax system, public budgets, returning value to the people back home and modern infrastructure, and in end to most corporate subsidies, increasingly they're demanding serious attention to climate disruption and other environmental and global health perils and pandemics
Big majority of people want efficient government and end to endless aggressive wars that boomerang
They want clean elections and fair rules for voters and candidates
These are changes that bring people together
Changes Congress can make happen
People around the world
Favorite democracy because it brings the best out of its inhabitants and its leaders
But this objective requires citizens to want to spend time on this great opportunity called democracy between and add elections
History gives examples that encourage us to believe that breaking through powers easier and we think
People say to me, I don't know what to do
Start to learn by doing
The more they practice citizen action, the more skilled and innovative they become at it
Like learning a trade, a profession, a hobby, learning how to swim
They're doubts for each judgements and hesitancy
Begin to melt away in the crucible of action
Their arguments for change become deeper and sharper
In 1965 to 1966, when I was making the case for safer automobiles, I realized that there are a lot of industries making a lot of money from dealing with the horrific results of crashes
Medical care and insurance sales, repairing cars
There is a perverse incentive to do nothing but maintain the status quo
By contrast, preventing these tragedies, freeze consumer dollars to spend or save and volunteer roads for better livelihoods
What it takes is a small number of people to exert their civic muscle, both as individuals and organized groups on our legal decision makers
Ideally, it only takes a few enlightened rich people contributing funds to accelerate citizen efforts against the commanders of greed and power Why in our past rich people donated essential money for the Annie slavery, women's right to vote, and civil rights movements? We should remember that
With the onset of climate catastrophe, every one of us needs to have a higher estimate of our own significance, of our own sustained dedication to the civic life, or part of a normal way of daily living, along with our personal family life
Showing up thoughtfully is half a democracy
That's what advances life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
Remember, our country's full of problems we don't deserve and solutions which we do not apply
That gap is a democracy gap that no power can stop us from closing
We owe this to our posterity
Don't we want our descendants instead of cursing us for our short-sighted neglect? Don't we want them to bless our foresight and bright horizons, which can fulfill their lives peacefully and advance the common good
Thank you
