In the 1980s, the world faced a huge problem
There was a rapidly expanding hole in the ozone layer
So what happened? And is it still there? Let's go back to the beginning
The sun makes life on earth possible, but too much exposure to its UV radiation, damage is plant an animal DNA
Thankfully, about 98% of that radiation is absorbed by ozone molecules dispersed in the stratosphere, which are continuously broken apart and reformed in this process, maintaining a delicate equilibrium
But in the early 1970s, two chemists, Mario Molina, and Sherwood Rolling, demonstrated that widely used chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, could upset the balance
CFCs were developed in the 1920s by three US-based corporations as coolants for refrigerators
Unlike existing alternatives such as ammonia or methyl chloride, CFCs were non-flammable and non-toxic, meaning they wouldn't burst into flames or cause deadly gas leaks
They also made great propellants, foaming agents and fire retardants
CFCs soon found their way into a variety of everyday items, and became a multi-billion dollar per year industry
In the lower atmosphere, CFC's don't break down or react with other molecules, but Molina and Roland showed that in the stratosphere, they're broken apart by UV light releasing chlorine atoms
These then react with ozone, destroying it faster than it can be replenished
A single chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules before finally reacting with something else, informing a stable molecule
Seeing the The threat to their bottom line, CFC producers pushed back to discredit the scientists, even accusing them of working for the KGB
Initial estimates showed that within 60 years CFCs could reduce ozone concentrations by 7%, but by 1985 it became clear that ozone depletion, especially over Antarctica, was happening much faster
Here the extremely cold temperatures and unique structure of Antarctic clouds accelerated ozone loss
Scientists stationed in Antarctica noticed a massive drop in overhead ozone occurring every spring
Sadly, data revealed the vast extent of these losses and chemical tests conferred that the cause was unquestionably CFCs
NASA soon released visualizations which were broadcast around the world and captured public attention
If ozone depletion continued, rates of skin cancer would skyrocket
Photosynthesis would be impaired, making plants including rice, weed and corn, less productive, and more susceptible to disease
Global agricultural production would plummet, an entire ecosystems would collapse
But many politicians weighing immediate economic concerns over long-term ones disagreed about what to do
The fight to ban CFCs found two unlikely allies in U
S
President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
Despite their general opposition to government regulation, Reagan, who had undergone treatment for skin cancer, and a thatcher, who was trained as a chemist, recognized the need for immediate action
The US and UK, along with Canada, Norway, Sweden and Finland, led calls for an international ban on CFCs
In 1987, representatives signed the Montreal Protocol, requiring the rapid phasing out of CFCs, and creating a fund to assist global South countries in obtaining affordable, non-infinite ozone depleting alternatives
It was later ratified by every country on earth, the only treaty in history to achieve this
In 1995, Molina, Roland, and their Dutch colleague Paul KÃ¼rtsen were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
As the use of CFCs declined, the ozone hole began shrinking and is predicted to disappear entirely by 2070
But we're not out of the woods yet, while the ban was a win for the climate, as CFCs are potent greenhouse gases, The alternatives that replace them, hydrophlural carbons, or HFCs, are two
While generally less potent than CFCs, HFCs still trap more heat than carbon dioxide, and are contributing to climate change
To address this, in 2016, the Kigali Amendment was added to the Montreal Protocol, calling for an 85% cut in global HFCs by 2047
This alone could avoid up to 0
5 degrees Celsius of global warming by the end of the century
Today, as we face the existential threat of climate change, the Montreal Protocol serves as a model for the decisive global cooperation we need to combat it
The question is, what will it take for us to come together again?
