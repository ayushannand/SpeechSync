Though they were once conquered by a powerful neighbor, the kings and queens of Kush would go on to successfully challenge two of the most dominant empires in history. From 1500 to 1100 BCE, Egypt controlled Kush.
The civilization of Kush was more than a thousand years old at that time.
Its early capital city at Kerma had impressive temples, palaces and houses, including a massive mud brick temple structure that had a chapel deep inside.
Rich gold mines helped the Kushites build a flourishing commercial network, making bronze weapons and tools and trading materials like incense, animal skins, ivory.
The tide started to change for Kush as Egypt descended into civil war.
By 750 BCE Egypt was divided into local kingdoms with

use that opportunity to chop it up with him and often when they're done talking with him, they'll mention that he thinks he's smart and engaged.
When those people walk away, the thought that comes to my mind is that I hope they remember meeting him as a child when they see him again as a grown man.
This thought comes to my mind because I've written two books about race and racism in the United States and this kind of work can
One of the things that I've learned is that Americans have an orientation toward progress. And this context, what that means is that we often celebrate the distance between where we were.
But that same orientation can bind us from the gap between where we are and where we could.
The other thing that I've learned about Americans is that we have a very, very narrow understanding of racism. Mostly in the minds and hearts of people.
And this really narrow definition can constrain our opportunities to produce some more racially egalitarian society.
We like to hunt for races in distance ourselves from people who say mean things about whole groups of people or who idealize the 1950s, but the fact of the matter is
Now, I'm not saying that everyone here is the racist, but what I am saying is that everyone here has the capacity and perhaps even the propensity to live their life in a way, to make decisions, to rely on bias.
So people say, well, you do all this work about it.

And I say that the first thing we might need to do is to come to a shared understanding about what recent basis
History shows that racist have had the upper hand in deciding who the racist are and what racism is and it's never been where the things are
But maybe if we come together and come to a shared and perhaps a precise definition of what racism is, we can work toward creating a society where mothers like me aren't in constant fear of their children's lives. I'd like to dispel three myths about racism on our trip toward mutual understanding. First,
But there are other states and regions that are competing for the title.
For example, if we look at the most segregated states in terms of where black kids go to school, we'll see
there's some out west in the Midwest and in the

or if we look at states with the biggest racial disparities in terms of prison populations, we see that none of

My colleague Rebecca Kreitz, her an I, looked at a standard matter of racial attitudes, a prejudice. And we found that in the 1990s, states in the

By 2016, we found that the decoders in Nebraska states in the Midwest and the Northeast were competing.

time.
I'm not saying that.
Well, people were going back to your books to look for things that were obviously racist. Fewer people were looking into the current day policy scances of
So how many of us might have supported a candidate who was willing to let neighborhoods succeed from their district so that kids could go to all white schools?
or how many of us might have supported a ballot measure that systematically reduced some group's chances.
or how many of us might have focused on the behavior of black mothers, rather than doctors or healthcare systems and policies when we learn about the huge racial disparities and maternity
It doesn't have to be like this.
We hit do something different.
We could scrutinize the behaviors of the rule.
If you believe that when all the grandmas and this is sippy die, that racism is going to go with them, you are in for a big disappointment. We like to think that young people are going to do the hard work of eradicating racism, but there's some things that we might.

When we ask them about the things that are important to them, they don't have any particular sense of urgency around questions.

Well, you do all this work about racism, what's the answer? And I say that the first thing we might need to do
The research shows that white parents in particular will either choose to not talk about issues of racism to their kids in order to protect them from a harsh racial reality or they still color blind lessons.

We can have heart conversations with our kids so that they don't grow up like many of us did thinking that talking about racism makes you a racist. It doesn't. And so that we can prevent
Remember a long, long time ago in 2008 when we were all
But in order to do that, we'd have to come together to have a shared definition of racism, not just in the matter of hearts and minds, but in systems, policies, rules, decisions made over and over again to marginalize some people.
So we could ask harder questions of candidates about their stance as on racial inequality before we throw
We could buy a car or buy a car business with practices.
We could talk to our kids about racism.
We could figure out our state's special brand of racism and work to eradicate it.
